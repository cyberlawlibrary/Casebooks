## About

This is an informal collection of e-books. It's meant to allow students to read their textbooks in a browser without having to use the clumsy interface that the textbook publishers force on students. With this version, you can **print as much as you want**, **access the book offline from unlimited devices**, and **keep it forever** without worrying that a company will cut off your access to the text.
You can access these books online simply by clicking the links below, or you can download them for offline, permanent access.

## How to save offline versions

It's a good idea to save a copy of the book, in case the online version is taken down or you want to read the book offline.

#### Chrome

Use command-S or right click and choose "Save As." You can then choose from three options for Format: "html," "single file," or "complete." Choosing "single file" is easiest: it will download one file that contains both the text of the book and all images and formatting information. To view the book, you can right click the file, select "Open with," and choose Chrome. Voila!

Choosing "complete" will download an html file of the book and a folder with all the book images and a css file that controls the book's appearance. It's important to keep the html file and that folder in the same place on your computer. For example, they should both be in downloads, documents, desktop, etc â€” they need to be in the same folder. Otherwise, the book will look weird and won't display images. Double-clicking on the html file will likely open it in your default browser; if that doesn't work, you can drag the html file into a browser window. Voila!

#### Safari

Use command-S or right click and choose "Save Page As." You can then choose from two options for Format: webarchive or page source. Choose webarchive. This will download one webarchive file. This one file contains both the text of the book and all images and formatting information.

Double-clicking on the webarchive file will open it in safari; if that doesn't work, you can drag the file into a safari window. Voila!


### Technical Details

These browser ebooks are html files, which means they're easier to use than a scanned pdf of the book. An html file of the entire casebook is thousands of times smaller than an equivalent pdf file. This setup makes a high quality digital casebook accessible to students who don't have high speed internet connection or a powerful computer.
If you are familiar with html or down to experiment and learn, you can easily supplement the casebook by inserting diagrams, pictures, notes, colored tabs, etc. There's no special tools needed to edit the html files. Instead of opening the ebook with your browser, just open it with a text editor, like TextEdit on Mac or Notepad on PC.
If you haven't used html before, be warned the file may look overwhelming at first, and you can google html formatting rules to be able to add the text or images you want.

### Help with this project

If you appreciate this resource and want to help expand the collection, you can help in one of two ways.
1. You can send us the html files from an ebook of one of your textbooks. Login to the publisher's website, load up your ebook, and download the html files for each section of the book. Please use Chrome, and follow the instructions above for downloading webpages in Chrome. Send the folders you download to cyberlawlibrary@gmail.com.  
2. If you want an easier option, just send us your login info at cyberlawlibrary@gmail.com and we will be happy to download the files ourselves. We will only need access to your account for a day or so, and we will delete the email with your login information after accessing the ebooks. You can then change the password so that your account is secure.

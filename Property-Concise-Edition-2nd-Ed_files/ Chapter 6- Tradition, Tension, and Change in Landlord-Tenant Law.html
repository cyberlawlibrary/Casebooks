The principal leaseholds are the term of years, the periodic tenancy, the tenancy at will, and the tenancy at sufferance. We consider them in turn.</p>

<p id="e11c722b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A <i>term of years</i> is an estate that lasts for some fixed period of time or for a period computable by a formula that results in fixing calendar dates for beginning and ending, once the term is created or becomes possessory. The period can be one day, two months, five years, or 3,000 years. These are all terms of years. At common law, there was no limit on the number of years permitted, but in some American states, statutes limit the duration of terms of years. A term must be for a fixed period, but it can be terminable earlier upon the happening of some event or condition. Because a term of years states from the outset when it will terminate, no notice of termination is necessary to bring the estate to an end.</p>

Ordinarily, the landlord has retained the right to possession at the end of the leasehold, and the landlord’s future interest is a reversion. But it is possible for a third party to take possession immediately upon termination of the leasehold. In that case, the future interest will be a remainder.</p>

<p id="e11c9941-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A <i>periodic tenancy</i> is a lease for a period of some fixed duration that continues for succeeding periods until either the landlord or tenant gives notice of termination. Examples: “to <i>A</i> from month to month”; “to <i>B</i> from year to year.” If notice is not given, the period is automatically extended for another period. (These are <span title="282" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-282">p. 282</span>examples of express periodic tenancies.

<p id="e11c9942-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under common law rules, half a year’s notice is required to terminate a year-to-year tenancy. For example, if <i>T</i> is a year-to-year tenant beginning January 1, 2010, <i>L</i> must receive notice of termination before July 1, 2010, or <i>T</i> can be held over for another period—until January 1, 2012. For any periodic tenancy of less than a year, notice of termination must be given equal to the length of the period, but not to exceed six months. The notice must terminate the tenancy on the final day of the period, not in the middle of the tenancy. Thus, if a month-to-month tenant who began his tenancy on January 1 decided on March 20 to terminate, the earliest termination date would be April 30. In many states, statutes have shortened the length of notice required to terminate periodic tenancies and have permitted a month-to-month tenancy to be terminated at any time following 30 days’ notice.</p>

<p id="e11c994a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A <i>tenancy at will</i> is a tenancy of no fixed period that endures so long as both landlord and tenant desire. If the lease provides that it can be terminated by one party, it is necessarily at the will of the other as well <i>if</i> a tenancy at will has been created. Note, however, that a unilateral power to terminate a lease can be engrafted on a term of years or a periodic tenancy; for example, a lease by <i>L</i> to <i>T</i> for 10 years or until <i>L</i> sooner terminates creates a term of years determinable.</p>
<p id="e11c994b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The tenancy at will ends, among other ways, when one of the parties terminates it. (It also ends, as suggested above, at the death of one of the parties.) Modern statutes ordinarily require a period of notice—say 30 days or a time equal to the interval between rent payments—in order for one party or the other to terminate a tenancy at will. If under a tenancy for no fixed period rent is reserved or paid periodically, a periodic tenancy, rather than a tenancy at will, arises in most jurisdictions by implication.</p>

<p id="e11cc05e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The so-called <i>tenancy at sufferance</i> arises when a tenant remains in possession (holds over) after termination of the tenancy. Common law rules give the landlord confronted with a holdover essentially two options—eviction (plus damages) or consent (express or implied) to the creation of a new tenancy. Some jurisdictions have changed these rules. Complications arise in any event.</p>
<p id="e11cc05f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose, for example, that a tenant holds over after the end date of a one-year term, sends the landlord a check for the usual monthly rental payment, and the landlord cashes it. Since the landlord has elected not to evict, there appears to be a new tenancy. But of what sort? The answer varies, depending on the jurisdiction. In most, holding over gives rise to a periodic tenancy, in the balance, it results in a term. As to the basis for the length of the period or term, on one view it is the length of the original period or term, with the maximum length limited in either case to one year. Other courts base length (again limited to no more than a year) on the way rent was computed in the original lease. This is not so straightforward as it sounds. A lease might state (the technical term is “reserve”) an annual rent of, say, $12,000, but call for it to be paid in installments of $1,000 at the beginning of each month. So, is there a new term of one month (or a new periodic tenancy of month-to-month), or is there instead a new term of one year (or a new periodic tenancy of year-to-year)? Again, it depends on the jurisdiction.</p>
<p id="e11cc060-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These points aside, the tenancy resulting from holding over is usually subject to the same terms and conditions (the amount of rent, the duty to repair, and so forth) as those in the original lease, unless the parties agree otherwise or unless some term or condition is regarded as inconsistent with the new situation.</p>
<p id="e11cc061-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many states have adopted legislation to deal with holdovers, but in widely varying ways. Some statutes specify the length of the holdover tenancy. See, e.g., Cal. Civ. Code §1945 (West 2016) (“not exceeding one month when the rent is payable monthly, nor in any case one year”). Others, probably only a few, convert the holdover tenancy into a tenancy at will and provide that the tenant shall be liable for the reasonable value of use and occupation—even though this may be less than the rent agreed upon in the original lease! Such, at least, is one judicial interpretation. See Townsend v. Singleton, 183 S.E.2d 893 (S.C. 1971). Still other statutes provide that landlords may demand double rent from holdover tenants.</p>

<p id="e11cc06a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellees transferred ownership of two parcels of land in Whitehouse, Texas to Grace Covenant Fellowship Church (“Grace” or “church”). Part of the transfer was a gift, and part was a sale. The deed does not include any language which would indicate that the couples had reserved a life estate for themselves. Contemporaneously, the church leased one of the parcels of land back to Appellees. The document stated that the lease would continue in effect until “the date of death of the last of the Lessees to die.”</p>
<p id="e11cc06b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Four years later, the church sold the acreage to Kajo Church Square, Inc. and the church building to Kajo Trust. One week after purchasing the property, Kajo notified Appellees that it was terminating the lease. The two couples filed a declaratory judgment action against Kajo, asking the court to declare the rights and responsibilities of all parties as to the property. They sought a declaratory judgment that they had retained a life estate interest in the property or, in the alternative, that their lease of the property was a lease for life, terminable only upon the death of all four Appellees. They also pleaded that if, in fact, the property interest was a lease, Kajo breached that contract when it gave Appellees notice of termination of that lease. . . . </p>
<p id="e11cc06c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment, as did Kajo.

The cardinal rule applied in construing written instruments, including deeds, is to give effect to the intention of the parties as expressed by the language used by them in the instrument. When the terms of a deed plainly and clearly disclose the intention of the parties, or the language used is not fairly susceptible to more than one interpretation, the intention of the parties must be ascertained by the court as a matter of law from the language used in the writing. . . . </p>

Additionally, Appellees offered the warranty deed from Grace to Kajo as evidence that Kajo accepted the transfer of the property from Appellees to Grace with all encumbrances, including the lease for life. With the above-described evidence, Appellees showed that there was no disputed fact issue as to a lease for life, and that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>
<p id="e11ce788-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, in its response, Kajo argued that the lease creates no more than a tenancy at will. It cited Nitschke v. Doggett, 489 S.W.2d 335 (Tex. Civ. App.-Austin 1972), vacated on other grounds, 498 S.W.2d 339 (Tex. 1973), for the proposition that the lease document does not, in fact, create a lease or tenancy for life.

<p id="e11ce78b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although there is a dearth of authority to support Kajo’s position, it is bolstered by landlord-tenant law, which recognizes only four types of leases: the term of years, the periodic tenancy, the tenancy at will, and the tenancy at sufferance. Thomas W. Merrill and Henry E. Smith, Optimal Standardization in the Law of Property: The Numerus Clausus Principle, 110 Yale L.J. 1, 11 (2000). . . . Thus, a leasehold for life is not a recognized property right. Therefore, as a matter of law, the lease constitutes a tenancy at will. Consequently, the trial court erred when it granted Appellees’ motion and denied Kajo’s motion on this issue. Accordingly, we hold that Kajo owns the property in fee simple, encumbered only by a tenancy at will. . . .</p>

<p id="e11ce78d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Kajo asserts that its termination of the lease was not a breach of contract.

They attached the lease as evidence that Kajo had breached their contract when it terminated their lease.

<p id="e11ce794-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>The parties’ intentions.</i></b> When interpreting ambiguous or otherwise unclear language in instruments of voluntary transfers, courts normally try to carry out the intentions of the parties. Did the court do so in <i>Kajo Church Square</i>? If not, why not?</p>
<p id="e11ce795-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>A leasehold for life?</i></b> When faced with language like that <i>Kajo Church Square</i>, most courts react as the Texas court did, by trying to construe the interest as fitting one of the established estate forms (and perhaps in the process doing violence to the parties’ intentions). But there have been exceptions. For example, in Garner v. Gerrish, 473 N.E.2d 223 (N.Y. 1984), a lease described its duration this way: “for and during the term of <i>quiet enjoyment</i> from the <i>first</i> day of <i>May</i>, 1977 which term will end—<i>Lou Gerrish has the privilege of termination</i> [<i>sic</i>] <i>this agreement at a date of his own choice</i>.”</p>

<p id="e11d0ea8-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The legal nature of some arrangements is often unclear. Consider billboards, for example. Suppose, for example, that <i>A</i> “rents” from <i>B</i> the right to erect a billboard on land owned by <i>B.</i> Is the arrangement a lease, or is it something else, such as a license or still some other legal category? Or what about a cosmetics concession in a department store? In answering such questions, courts looks at a number of different variables, including the intention of the parties, the number of restrictions on use, the exclusivity of possession, the degree of control retained by the granting party, the presence or absence of incidental services, and so on. The typical billboard situation creates an easement or a license, not lease, for example, because although there is exclusive possession it doesn’t really interfere with the grantor’s right of possession in any substantial way. See 1 American Law of Property §§3.3-3.8 (1952 &amp; Supp. 1977). </p>
<p id="e11d0ea9-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why might it matter whether any given arrangement amounts to a lease, as opposed to something else? The answer, for now, has to be limited to a pretty empty generalization: it matters primarily whether or not an arrangement amounts to a lease because leases give rise to the landlord-tenant relationship, which carries with it certain incidents—certain rights and duties and liabilities and remedies—that do not attach to other relationships. Those incidents are the chief concern of the balance of this chapter.</p>

<p id="e11d0eaa-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court held that the language created a unilateral tenancy at will for the life of the tenant (Gerrish). Does that interpretation fit any of the recognized common law estates? The interest could also be called a “determinable life estate,” determinable by the tenant. Does that interpretation conform to the parties’ intent? In the end, does it matter which interpretation, a tenancy at will or a life estate, the court adopts, so long as it gets closest to what the parties wanted? It may. As we will see later in this chapter, certain rules that protect landlords or tenants do not apply to life estates, which, recall, are freehold estates, unlike leaseholds.</p>

<p id="e11d0ead-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here is another question you will see playing a part in much of the material that follows: Is a lease a <i>conveyance</i> or a <i>contract</i>? Actually, of course, it is both. A lease transfers a possessory interest in land, so it is a conveyance that creates property rights. But it is also the case that leases usually contain a number of promises (or covenants, which originally referred to promises under seal)—such as a promise by the tenant to pay rent or a promise by the landlord to provide utilities—so the lease is a contract, too, thus creating contract rights. Historically, it was lease-as-conveyance that the courts tended to stress, but over the last several decades this has changed, to some degree, in favor of a view emphasizing the contractual nature of leases. The objective of the new orientation has been to reform the “property law” of landlord and tenant by importing into it much of the modern law of contracts. Courts today commonly rely, explicitly, on contract principles to reshape the law of leases with respect to such questions as the following: (1) Are the covenants in leases “mutually dependent,” such that (as in contract doctrine) a material breach by one party excuses further performance by the other party, even if the lease does not so provide? (2) If the tenant wrongfully abandons the leased premises, must the landlord take steps to mitigate (reduce) the damages, say by searching for a suitable new tenant? (3) Is a warranty of quality—that the leased premises are habitable or fit for their purpose—to be implied in leases? We shall be addressing questions like these in subsequent sections of this chapter.</p>
<p id="e11d0eae-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The Statute of Frauds.</i> Every state has a statute of frauds patterned in one way or another after the English Statute of Frauds enacted in the seventeenth century. Commonly, the American statutes provide that leases for more than one year must be in writing. All but a few jurisdictions permit oral leases for a term less than a year; those that do not usually hold that entry under an oral lease plus payment of rent creates a periodic tenancy that is not subject to the statute.</p>
<p id="e11d0eaf-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Form leases and the question of “bargaining power.”</i> The written lease can be a long document. Unlike a deed, by which (in the usual case) all of the seller’s interest is conveyed to the buyer forever, a lease contemplates a continuing relationship between landlord and tenant. Thus deeds are commonly brief, whereas leases can be wordy, full of clauses to handle various contingencies. Quite typically, landlords use form leases—standardized documents offered to all tenants on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, with no negotiation over terms. Does this indicate that tenants lack bargaining power, such that harsh terms can be forced upon them by landlords? Some commentators argue that the motives behind adhesion contracts are not necessarily sinister. The reason may simply be that the seller is trying to avoid the costs of negotiating and drafting a separate agreement with each purchaser. “[W]hat is important is not whether there is haggling in every transaction but whether competition forces sellers to incorporate in their standard contracts terms that protect the purchasers.” Richard A. Posner, Economic Analysis of Law 125 (9th ed. 2014). On this view, the underlying problem is not form leases but monopoly power—created, say, by a shortage of rental housing.</p>

The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits only state (not private) action, but the Supreme Court’s decision in Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1 (1948), effectively eliminated at least some private discrimination as well. (In <i>Shelley</i>, the Court held that state courts could not enforce racially restrictive land use agreements entered into by neighbors.)

The 1866 law is narrower than the Fair Housing Act in that it reaches only racial discrimination, does not deal with discrimination in the provision of services and facilities, and does not prohibit discriminatory advertising; it is broader, however, in that it is not limited to dwellings and contains none of the exemptions found in the Fair Housing Act.</p>

Once a plaintiff establishes either, “the defendant must then justify the action as one taken in pursuit of a bona fide, compelling governmental purpose, with no less discriminatory alternative available to achieve the goal, or in the case of private defendants, one taken pursuant to a rational and necessary business purpose.” James A. Kushner, The Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988: The Second Generation of Fair Housing, 42 Vand. L. Rev. 1049, 1074-1075 (1989).</p>

Ct. 2507 (2015), the United States Supreme Court, by a 5-4 vote, upheld the disparate-impact doctrine as a means to enforce the Fair Housing Act. Under the Court’s decision, however, disparate-impact claims cannot be based solely on statistical disparities; a plaintiff has to show that a defendant’s policy actually caused that disparity.</p>

Are there any violations of 42 U.S.C.A §1982 or §3604? See United States v. Hunter, 459 F.2d 205 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 934 (1972) (discriminatory advertisement). Suppose the advertisement had not contained the word “white.” What result? See Bush v. Kaim, 297 F. Supp. 151 (N.D. Ohio 1969) (discussing discriminatory actions). Suppose the advertisement had not said “in private white home,” but had said “rented only to persons speaking Polish, German, or Swedish.” What result? See Holmgren v. Little Village Community Reporter, 342 F. Supp. 512 (N.D. Ill. 1971) (discrimination based on national origin).</p>

Cobb, 481 U.S. 615 (1987) (taking “race” to mean what it meant in 1866).</p>

Call Pat at 917-4513.” Does this language violate the federal Fair Housing Act (should it matter whether Pat is a single woman looking for a roommate)? The advertisement aside, may Pat discriminate in selecting someone with whom to share the apartment and the rent? Does the answer turn on whether the “2-bdrm. 2-bath apt.” is in a large multi-unit complex or, instead, is one of two apartments in an owner-occupied duplex? See Fair Housing Council of San Fernando Valley v. Roommate.com, LLC., 666 F.3d 1216 (9th Cir. 2012) (interpreting “dwelling” within the Fair Housing Act as not applying to shared living quarters; FHA does not apply to roommate selection or advertising for roommates).</p>
<p id="e11d5bf9-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(d) A newspaper publishers’ association has compiled a catalog of “taboo, troublesome, and safe words” for real estate advertisements. Such expressions as able-bodied, bachelor, near churches, couples only, empty nesters, exclusive, executive, responsible, healthy-only, and no smokers are part of a long list of unacceptable terms. It is acceptable to mention a location near bus lines, to say a credit check is required, to say no drugs or drinking (but not no alcoholics), to refer to school districts, to mention a senior discount, or the presence of a nursery. Caution is advised with respect to statements like fisherman’s retreat, no gays, no lesbians, handyman’s dream, prestigious, nanny’s room, quality neighborhood, and secure.

<p id="e11d5bfd-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(a) Landlords, a retired couple, have eight single family houses for rent. They limit the number of occupants in each house depending upon its size, number of bedrooms, layout, and yard size. Their business strategy is to maintain their houses well and to rent them for slightly below market in order to give tenants an incentive to stay, thereby avoiding turnover. One of their houses is a 1,200-square-foot house, consisting of a living room, master bedroom, another 10 × 10 bedroom, two baths, a den opening directly into the living room (which could be used as a bedroom), and very little yard. The landlords limit occupancy of this house to four persons and refuse to rent to a couple with three children. See Pfaff v. H.U.D., 88 F.3d 739 (9th Cir. 1996) (even if the numerical occupancy limitations have a disparate impact on families with children, they could be justified on the ground of maintaining the economic value of the property).</p>

State and local measures may not, of course, operate to narrow the rights and remedies available under federal law, but they may and sometimes do have a broader reach, covering, for example, discrimination based on age, sexual orientation, marital status—and, at least in Austin, Texas, status as a student! Once again, the discussion below suggests the range of problems and judicial responses.</p>

What result? See Smith v. Fair Employment &amp; Housing Commission, 913 P.2d 909 (Cal. 1996); Swanner v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission, 874 P.2d 274 (Alaska 1994) (<i>Smith</i> and <i>Swanner</i> both held that the freedom of religion clause of the Constitution does not exempt landlords from complying with a neutral law of general applicability); Note, The Religious Landlord and the Conflict Between Free Exercise Rights and Housing Discrimination Laws—Which Interest Prevails? 47 Hastings L.J. 1669 (1996).</p>
<p id="e11d5c09-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(b) New York legislation prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, creed, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or marital status.<i> L</i> refuses to rent an apartment to <i>T</i>, a divorced black woman, who subsequently brings suit claiming unlawful discrimination. <i>L</i> testifies that his refusal was motivated only by the fact that <i>T</i> is a lawyer. He finds lawyers to be troublesome tenants, and he prefers to rent to passive people who are not attuned to their legal rights. What result? See Kramarsky v. Stahl Management, 401 N.Y.S.2d 943 (Sup. Ct. 1977) (holding for landlord because his testimony was credible and the state legislation does not prohibit discrimination against lawyers). See also Verne G. Kopytoff, A Developer Balks at Selling to a Lawyer, N.Y. Times, Sept. 12, 1999, reporting on a similar case of discrimination against a lawyer in Bakersfield, California, and pointing out that only a few cities have laws that protect buyers and tenants based on their profession. “One is New York City, which passed a law in 1986 prohibiting discrimination based on profession after lawyers, among others, complained that landlords had refused to rent them apartments.”</p>

He paid the rent for the months of August, September and October, 1960, directly to complainants. In December, 1960, complainants contacted defendant with reference to the November rent and at that time defendant stated he had been advised he was not liable to them for rent. However, defendant paid the basic monthly rental of $350.00 to complainants in June, 1961. This was the final payment received by complainants during the term of the lease as amended. The record is not clear whether defendant continued to operate the business after the last payment of rent or abandoned it. Defendant, however, remained in possession of the property until the expiration of the leasehold.</p>

Defendant did not reply to this demand.</p>
<p id="e11dd15f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On August 1, 1962, complainants filed their bill in this cause seeking a recovery of $2,404.58 which they alleged was the balance due on the basic rent of $350.00 per month for the first year of the lease and the sum of $4,200.00, the basic rent for the second year, and the further sum necessary for the removal of the improvements constructed on the property.</p>
<p id="e11dd160-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The theory of the bill is that the agreement between Rogers, the original lessee, and the defendant, Conditt, is an assignment of the lease; and, therefore, defendant is directly and primarily liable to complainants.</p>
<p id="e11dd161-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant by his answer insists the agreement between Rogers and himself is a sublease and therefore Rogers is directly and primarily liable to complainants.</p>
<p id="e11df872-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Chancellor heard the matter on the depositions of both complainants and three other witnesses offered in behalf of complainants and documentary evidence filed in the record.

<p id="e11df874-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant has appealed to this Court and has assigned errors insisting the Chancellor erred in failing to hold the instrument to be a sublease rather than an assignment.</p>
<p id="e11df875-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To support his theory the instrument is a sublease, the defendant insists the amendment to the lease entered into between Rogers and complainants was for the express purpose of extending the term of the lease and obtaining the consent of the lessors to a “subletting” of the premises to defendant. That by the use of the words “sublet” and “subletting” no other construction can be placed on the amendment and the agreement of Rogers and the acceptance of defendant attached thereto.</p>
<p id="e11df876-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Further, since complainants agreed to the subletting of the premises to defendant “upon the express condition and understanding that the original lessee, Frank <span title="297" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-297">p. 297</span>D. Rogers, will remain personally liable for the faithful performance of all the terms and conditions of the original lease and this amendment to the original lease,” no construction can be placed upon this language other than it was the intention of complainants to hold Rogers primarily liable for the performance of the original lease and the amendment thereto. And, therefore, Rogers, for his own protection, would have the implied right to re-enter and perform the lease in the event of a default on the part of the defendant. This being true, Rogers retained a reversionary interest in the property sufficient to satisfy the legal distinction between a sublease and an assignment of a lease.</p>
<p id="e11df877-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is then urged the following rules of construction of written instruments support the above argument:</p>

<p id="e11df87a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As stated in complainants’ brief, the liability of defendant to complainants depends upon whether the transfer of the leasehold interest in the premises from Rogers is an assignment of the lease or a sublease. If the transfer is a sublease, no privity of contract exists between complainants and defendant; and, therefore, defendant could not be liable to complainants on the covenant to pay rent and the expense of the removal of the improvements. But, if the transfer is an assignment of the lease, privity of contract does exist between complainants and defendant; and defendant would be liable directly and primarily for the amount of the judgment. . . . </p>
<p id="e11df87b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The general rule as to the distinction between an assignment of a lease and a sublease is an assignment conveys the whole term, leaving no interest nor reversionary interest in the grantor or assignor. Whereas, a sublease may be generally defined as a transaction whereby a tenant grants an interest in the leased premises less than his own, or reserves to himself a reversionary interest in the term.</p>
<p id="e11df87c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The common law distinction between an assignment of a lease and a sublease is succinctly stated in the case of Jaber v. Miller, 219 Ark. 59, 239 S.W.2d 760: “If the instrument purports to transfer the lessee’s estate for the entire remainder of his term it is an assignment, regardless of its form or the parties’ intention. Conversely, if the instrument purports to transfer the lessee’s estate for less than the entire term—even for a day less—it is a sublease, regardless of its form or of the parties’ intention.”</p>

<p id="e11e1f92-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is our opinion under either the common law or modern rule of construction the agreement between Rogers and defendant is an assignment of the lease.</p>

The obligations and liabilities of a lessee to a lessor, under the express covenants of a lease, are not in anywise affected by an assignment or a subletting to a third party, in the absence of an express or implied agreement or some action on his part which amounts to a waiver or estops him from insisting upon compliance with the covenants. This is true even though the assignment or sublease is made with the consent of the lessor. By an assignment of a lease the privity of estate between the lessor and lessee is terminated, but the privity of contract between them still remains and is unaffected. Neither the privity of estate or contract between the lessor and lessee are affected by a sublease. 32 Am. Jur., Landlord and Tenant, Sections 356, 413, pages 310, 339.</p>
<p id="e11e1f94-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus the express agreement of Rogers to remain personally liable for the performance of the covenants of the lease created no greater obligation on his part or interest in the leasehold, other than as set forth in the original lease.</p>

Defendant went into possession of the property and paid the rent to complainants. He remained in possession of the property for the entire term.

<p id="e11e46af-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>The sublease/assignment distinction—why did it matter?</i></b> Both the parties and the court agreed that the result of the case turned on whether the transfer from Rogers to Conditt was a sublease or an assignment. Do you see why it mattered whether the transfer was one or the other? Let’s trace the legal relations among all three parties, Ernst, Rogers, and Conditt, in terms of privity of contract and privity of estate first if the transfer was a sublease, then an assignment:</p>
<p id="e11e46b0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Sublease or assignment: two tests.</i></b> The <i>Ernst</i> case indicates the two tests courts have used to determine whether a transfer from a lessee to a third party is a sublease or an assignment. The first (and most commonly used) test is formalistic: an <i>assignment</i> arises when the lessee transfers his entire interest under the lease—when, that is, he transfers the right to possession for the duration of the term. If the lessee transfers anything less than his entire interest (if two years remain on the lease and the lessee transfers for a term of one year), a <i>sublease</i> results. In the latter case, the lessee is said to have retained a reversion; the right to possession goes back (reverts) to him at the end of the period designated in the transfer. Suppose the lessee transfers all of his interest in some physical part of the premises; is this a sublease or a partial assignment? Most courts, quite correctly, say the latter. Suppose the lessee transfers his entire interest, but the instrument of transfer provides that if the transferee breaches any obligation of the lease, the original lessee may terminate the arrangement and retake possession (such a provision is called a power of termination or right of re-entry). A substantial minority of jurisdictions finds a sublease in this situation.</p>
<p id="e11e46b1-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second (and less common) test considers the intention of the parties. The actual words used—<i>sublease</i> or <i>assignment</i>—are not conclusive (witness the <i>Ernst</i> case), though they may be persuasive (except in those cases, hardly unheard of, when both terms are used). Indeed, one occasionally gets the impression that courts claiming to honor the intention of the parties are in fact doing nothing more than inferring that “intention” from use of the words <i>sublease</i> or <i>assignment</i>, without the slightest basis for assuming that the parties knew the consequences of what they were saying. See, e.g., Jaber v. Miller, 239 S.W.2d 760 (Ark. 1951).</p>

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="e11e46b3-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the time a transfer of an interest in the leased property is made, the transferor may exact a promise from the transferee that he will perform the promises in the lease which were made by the transferor. The exaction of such a promise does not relieve the transferor of liability on his promises. It does <span title="300" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-300">p. 300</span>give him a direct remedy against his transferee if the transferee fails to perform the promises, which remedy will continue to be available even after the transferee has transferred the interest to someone else. If the holder of the benefits of the promises made by the transferor acquires enforcement rights as a third party beneficiary against the transferee by virtue of the transferee’s promise to the transferor, then the transferee is in privity of contract with such third party beneficiary and a subsequent transfer by the transferee of an interest in the leased property will not affect that privity of contract liability.</p>
</div>
<p id="e11e46b4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is a doctrine in contract law known as the <i>third-party beneficiary contract</i>.

<p id="e11e6dcb-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The head lease in <i>Ernst</i> contained a provision (paragraph 5 of the lease) prohibiting assignment or sublease without the lessors’ approval.

As we saw earlier (see page 195), the common law has long disfavored restraints on alienation, but the situation is different with respect to restraints on tenants’ interests. The policy is thought to have less application to leasehold interests because landlords have a legitimate concern with protecting their reversionary interest and assuring that leasehold covenants are performed.</p>
<p id="e11e6dcc-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consent clauses raise questions regarding the scope of the landlord’s discretion to refuse consent to a proposed sublet or assignment. May the landlord refuse to give consent for any reason, or are there limitations on the scope of discretion? Some consent clauses themselves limit the landlord’s discretion by expressly providing that the landlord may not withhold consent “unreasonably.” Other clauses are silent on the question, providing no standard to guide the landlord’s exercise of discretion. One question is, where the consent clause provides no standard, may the landlord refuse consent for any reason whatsoever? That is, may the landlord act unreasonably, or will the court imply a requirement of reasonableness? Another question is, when a reasonableness requirement exists, either on the basis of the language in the lease or as an implied term, what factors are acceptable reasons for denying consent? Consider the next case.</p>

<p id="e11e94e5-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The allegations of the complaint may be summarized as follows. The lease at issue is for 14,400 square feet of hangar space at the San Jose Municipal Airport. The City of San Jose, as owner of the property, leased it to Irving and Janice Perlitch, who in turn assigned their interest to respondent Ernest Pestana, Inc. Prior to assigning their interest to respondent, the Perlitches entered into a 25-year sublease with one Robert Bixler commencing on January 1, 1970. The sublease covered an original five-year term plus four 5-year options to renew. The rental rate was to be increased every 10 years in the same proportion as rents increased on the master lease from the City of San Jose. The premises were to be used by Bixler for the purpose of conducting an airplane maintenance business.</p>
<p id="e11e94e6-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Bixler conducted such a business under the name “Flight Services” until, in 1981, he agreed to sell the business to appellants Jack Kendall, Grady O’Hara and Vicki O’Hara. The proposed sale included the business and the equipment, inventory and improvements on the property, together with the existing lease. The proposed assignees had a <span title="302" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-302">p. 302</span>stronger financial statement and greater net worth than the current lessee, Bixler, and they were willing to be bound by the terms of the lease.</p>
<p id="e11e94e7-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The lease provided that written consent of the lessor was required before the lessee could assign his interest, and that failure to obtain such consent rendered the lease voidable at the option of the lessor. Accordingly, Bixler requested consent from the Perlitches’ successor-in-interest, respondent Ernest Pestana, Inc. Respondent refused to consent to the assignment and maintained that it had an absolute right arbitrarily to refuse any such request. The complaint recites that respondent demanded “increased rent and other more onerous terms” as a condition of consenting to Bixler’s transfer of interest.</p>
<p id="e11e94e8-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The proposed assignees brought suit for declaratory and injunctive relief and damages seeking, inter alia, a declaration “that the refusal of Ernest Pestana, Inc. to consent to the assignment of the lease is unreasonable and is an unlawful restraint on the freedom of alienation. . . .” The trial court sustained a demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend and this appeal followed.</p>
<p id="e11e94e9-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The law generally favors free alienability of property, and California follows the common law rule that a leasehold interest is freely alienable. Contractual restrictions on the alienability of leasehold interests are, however, permitted. “Such restrictions are justified as reasonable protection of the interests of the lessor as to who shall possess and manage property in which he has a reversionary interest and from which he is deriving income.” (Schoshinski, American Law of Landlord and Tenant (1980) §8:15, at pp. 578-579. See also 2 Powell on Real Property, ¶ 246[1], at p. 372.97.)</p>
<p id="e11e94ea-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The common law’s hostility toward restraints on alienation has caused such restraints on leasehold interests to be strictly construed against the lessor. . . . This is particularly true where the restraint in question is a “forfeiture restraint,” under which the lessor has the option to terminate the lease if an assignment is made without his or her consent. . . . </p>
<p id="e11e94eb-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nevertheless, a majority of jurisdictions have long adhered to the rule that where a lease contains an approval clause (a clause stating that the lease cannot be assigned without the prior consent of the lessor), the lessor may arbitrarily refuse to approve a proposed assignee no matter how suitable the assignee appears to be and no matter how unreasonable the lessor’s objection. . . . The harsh consequences of this rule have often been avoided through application of the doctrines of waiver and estoppel, under which the lessor may be found to have waived (or be estopped from asserting) the right to refuse consent to assignment.</p>
<p id="e11e94ec-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The traditional majority rule has come under steady attack in recent years. A growing minority of jurisdictions now hold that where a lease provides for assignment only with the prior consent of the lessor, such consent may be withheld <i>only where the lessor has a commercially reasonable objection to the assignment</i>, even in the absence of a provision in the lease stating that consent to assignment will not be unreasonably withheld. (See Rest. 2d Property, §15.2(2) (1977); 21 A.L.R.4th 188 (1983).)</p>
<p id="e11e94ed-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that the minority rule is the preferable position. . . . </p>
<p id="e11e94ee-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The impetus for change in the majority rule has come from two directions, reflecting the dual nature of a lease as a conveyance of a leasehold interest and a contract. (See Medico-Dental etc. Co. v. Horton &amp; Converse (1942) 21 Cal. 2d 411, 418, 132 P.2d 457.) The policy against restraints on alienation pertains to leases in their nature as <i>conveyances.</i> Numerous courts and commentators have recognized that “[i]n recent <span title="303" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-303">p. 303</span>times the necessity of permitting reasonable alienation of commercial space has become paramount in our increasingly urban society.” (Schweiso v. Williams [(1984) 150 Cal. App. 3d 883, 887, 198 Cal. Rptr. 238.)] . . . </p>
<p id="e11ebbff-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One commentator explains as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="e11ebc00-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The common-law hostility to restraints on alienation had a large exception with respect to estates for years. A lessor could prohibit the lessee from transferring the estate for years to whatever extent he might desire. It was believed that the objectives served by allowing such restraints outweighed the social evils implicit in the restraints, in that they gave to the lessor a needed control over the person entrusted with the lessor’s property and to whom he must look for the performance of the covenants contained in the lease. Whether this reasoning retains full validity can well be doubted. Relationships between lessor and lessee have tended to become more and more impersonal. Courts have considerably lessened the effectiveness of restraint clauses by strict construction and liberal applications of the doctrine of waiver. With the shortage of housing and, in many places, of commercial space as well, the allowance of lease clauses forbidding assignments and subleases is beginning to be curtailed by statutes. [2 Powell, supra, ¶246[1], at pp. 372.97-372.98, fns. omitted.]</p>
</div>
<p id="e11ebc01-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Restatement Second of Property adopts the minority rule on the validity of approval clauses in leases: “A restraint on alienation without the consent of the landlord of a tenant’s interest in leased property is valid, <i>but the landlord’s consent to an alienation by the tenant cannot be withheld unreasonably,</i> unless a freely negotiated provision in the lease gives the landlord an absolute right to withhold consent.” (Rest. 2d Property, §15.2(2) (1977), italics added.)<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1067E_5eaa12e0-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1067E_5eaa12e0-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">3</a></span> A comment to the section explains:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="e11ebc03-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The landlord may have an understandable concern about certain personal qualities of a tenant, particularly his reputation for meeting his financial obligations. The preservation of the values that go into the personal selection of the tenant justifies upholding a provision in the lease that curtails the right of the tenant to put anyone else in his place by transferring his interest, but this justification does not go to the point of allowing the landlord arbitrarily and without reason to refuse to allow the tenant to transfer an interest in leased property. [Id., com. a.]</p>
</div>
<p id="e11ebc04-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the Restatement rule, the lessor’s interest in the character of his or her tenant is protected by the lessor’s right to object to a proposed assignee on reasonable commercial grounds. (See id., reporter’s note 7 at pp. 112-113.) The lessor’s interests are also protected by the fact that the original lessee remains liable to the lessor as a surety even if the lessor consents to the assignment and the assignee expressly assumes the obligations of the lease. . . . </p>
<p id="e11ebc05-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second impetus for change in the majority rule comes from the nature of a lease as a <i>contract</i>. As the Court of Appeal observed in Cohen v. Ratinoff, supra, “[s]ince Richard v. Degan &amp; Brody, Inc. [espousing the majority rule] was decided, . . . there has been an increased recognition of and emphasis on the duty of good faith and fair dealing inherent in every contract.” (Id., 147 Cal. App. 3d at p. 329, 195 Cal. Rptr. <span title="304" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-304">p. 304</span>84.) Thus, “[i]n every contract there is an implied covenant that neither party shall do anything which will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party to receive the fruits of the contract. . . .” (Universal Sales Corp. v. Cal. etc. Mfg. Co. (1942) 20 Cal. 2d 751, 771, 128 P.2d 665. . . .) “[W]here a contract confers on one party a discretionary power affecting the rights of the other, a duty is imposed to exercise that discretion in good faith and in accordance with fair dealing.” (Cal. Lettuce Growers v. Union Sugar Co. (1955) 45 Cal. 2d 474, 484, 289 P.2d 785. See also, Larwin-Southern California, Inc. v. J.G.B. Inv. Co. (1979) 101 Cal. App. 3d 626, 640, 162 Cal. Rptr. 52.) Here the lessor retains the discretionary power to approve or disapprove an assignee proposed by the other party to the contract; this discretionary power should therefore be exercised in accordance with commercially reasonable standards. . . . Under the minority rule, the determination whether a lessor’s refusal to consent was reasonable is a question of fact. Some of the factors that the trier of fact may properly consider in applying the standards of good faith and commercial reasonableness are: financial responsibility of the proposed assignee; suitability of the use for the particular property; legality of the proposed use; need for alteration of the premises; and nature of the occupancy, i.e., office, factory, clinic, etc.</p>
<p id="e11ebc06-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Denying consent solely on the basis of personal taste, convenience or sensibility is not commercially reasonable. Nor is it reasonable to deny consent “in order that the landlord may charge a higher rent than originally contracted for.” (Schweiso v. Williams, supra, 150 Cal. App. 3d at p. 886, 198 Cal. Rptr. 238.) This is because the lessor’s desire for a better bargain than contracted for has nothing to do with the permissible purposes of the restraint on alienation—to protect the lessor’s interest in the preservation of the property and the performance of the lease covenants. “‘[T]he clause is for the protection of the landlord <i>in its ownership and operation of the particular property—</i>not for its general economic protection.”’ (Ringwood Associates v. Jack’s of Route 23, Inc. [(1977) 153 N.J. Super. 294, 379 A.2d 508, 512], quoting Krieger v. Helmsley-Spear, Inc. (1973) 62 N.J. 423, 302 A.2d 129, italics added.)</p>
<p id="e11ebc07-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In contrast to the policy reasons advanced in favor of the minority rule, the majority rule has traditionally been justified on three grounds. Respondent raises a fourth argument in its favor as well. None of these do we find compelling.</p>
<p id="e11ebc08-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, it is said that a lease is a conveyance of an interest in real property, and that the lessor, having exercised a personal choice in the selection of a tenant and provided that no substitute shall be acceptable without prior consent, is under no obligation to look to anyone but the lessee for the rent. This argument is based on traditional rules of conveyancing and on concepts of freedom of ownership and control over one’s property.</p>
<p id="e11ebc09-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A lessor’s freedom at common law to look to no one but the lessee for the rent has, however, been undermined by the adoption in [many jurisdictions] of a rule that lessors—like all other contracting parties—have a duty to mitigate damages upon the lessee’s abandonment of the property by seeking a substitute lessee. Furthermore, the values that go into the personal selection of a lessee are preserved under the minority rule in the lessor’s right to refuse consent to assignment on any commercially reasonable grounds. Such grounds include not only the obvious objections to an assignee’s financial stability or proposed use of the premises, but a variety of other commercially reasonable objections as well. (See, e.g., Arrington v. Walter E. Heller Intl. Corp. (1975) 30 Ill. App. 3d 631, 333 N.E.2d 50 [desire to have only one “lead tenant” in order to preserve “image of the building” as tenant’s international headquarters]; Warmack v. <span title="305" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-305">p. 305</span>Merchants Natl. Bank of Fort Smith (Ark. 1981) 612 S.W.2d 733 [desire for good “tenant mix” in shopping center]; List v. Dahnke (Col. App. 1981) 638 P.2d 824 [lessor’s refusal to consent to assignment of lease by one restaurateur to another was reasonable where lessor believed proposed specialty restaurant would not succeed at that location].) The lessor’s interests are further protected by the fact that the original lessee remains a guarantor of the performance of the assignee. . . . </p>
<p id="e11ebc0a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second justification advanced in support of the majority rule is that an approval clause is an unambiguous reservation of absolute discretion in the lessor over assignments of the lease. The lessee could have bargained for the addition of a reasonableness clause to the lease (i.e., “consent to assignment will not be unreasonably withheld”). The lessee having failed to do so, the law should not rewrite the parties’ contract for them. . . . </p>
<p id="e11ee31b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Numerous authorities have taken a different view of the meaning and effect of an approval clause in a lease, indicating that the clause is not “clear and unambiguous,” as respondent suggests. As early as 1940, the court in Granite Trust Bldg. Corp. v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. [(D. Mass. 1940)] 36 F. Supp. 77, examined a standard approval clause and stated: “It would seem to be the better law that when a lease restricts a lessee’s rights by requiring consent before these rights can be exercised, <i>it must have been in the contemplation of the parties that the lessor be required to give some reason for withholding consent</i>.” (Id., at p. 78, italics added.) . . . </p>
<p id="e11ee31c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In light of . . . the increasing number of jurisdictions that have adopted the minority rule in the last 15 years, the assertion that an approval clause “clearly and unambiguously” grants the lessor absolute discretion over assignments is untenable. It is not a rewriting of a contract, as respondent suggests, to recognize the obligations imposed by the duty of good faith and fair dealing, which duty is implied by law in every contract.</p>
<p id="e11ee31d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The third justification advanced in support of the majority rule is essentially based on the doctrine of stare decisis. It is argued that the courts should not depart from the common law majority rule because “many leases now in effect covering a substantial amount of real property and creating valuable property rights were carefully prepared by competent counsel in reliance upon the majority viewpoint.” (Gruman v. Investors Diversified Services [(1956) 247 Minn. 502, 78 N.W.2d 377, 381.] . . .) As pointed out above, however, the majority viewpoint has been far from universally held and has never been adopted by this court. Moreover, the trend in favor of the minority rule should come as no surprise to observers of the changing state of real property law in the 20th century. The minority rule is part of an increasing recognition of the contractual nature of leases and the implications in terms of contractual duties that flow therefrom. We would be remiss in our duty if we declined to question a view held by the majority of jurisdictions simply because it is held by a majority. . . .</p>
<p id="e11ee31e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A final argument in favor of the majority rule is advanced by respondent and stated as follows: “Both tradition and sound public policy dictate that the lessor has a right, under circumstances such as these, to realize the increased value of his property.” Respondent essentially argues that any increase in the market value of real property during the term of a lease properly belongs to the lessor, not the lessee. We reject this assertion. . . . Respondent here is trying to get <i>more</i> than it bargained for in the lease. A lessor is free to build periodic rent increases into a lease, as the lessor did here. . . . Any increased value of the property beyond this “belongs” to the lessor only in the sense, as explained above, that the lessor’s reversionary estate will benefit from <span title="306" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-306">p. 306</span>it upon the expiration of the lease. We must therefore reject respondent’s argument in this regard. . . . </p>
<p id="e11ee31f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In conclusion, both the policy against restraints on alienation and the implied contractual duty of good faith and fair dealing militate in favor of adoption of the rule that where a commercial lease provides for assignment only with the prior consent of the lessor, such consent may be withheld only where the lessor has a commercially reasonable objection to the assignee or the proposed use. Under this rule, appellants have stated a cause of action against respondent Ernest Pestana, Inc.</p>
<p id="e11ee320-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Two justices dissented in <i>Kendall</i>, on the ground that the provisions of the agreement between the parties should be respected, especially because the lessor had relied upon the rule existing at the time of the lease. In the view of the dissent, the legislature had implicitly endorsed the common law rule overturned in <i>Kendall</i>; it was up to the legislature, not the court, to change the rule, and any change should be prospective only.]</p>

Defendant landlord, Wiley Enterprises, Inc., and defendant Rodney A. Wiley (hereafter collectively referred to as Wiley) appeal from a judgment upon a jury verdict awarding plaintiff tenant, A Family Affair Restaurant, Inc., damages for wrongful eviction from its leased premises. The issues for review are whether the evidence <span title="309" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-309">p. 309</span>was sufficient to support the jury’s finding that the tenant did not abandon or surrender the premises and whether the trial court erred in finding Wiley’s reentry forcible and wrongful as a matter of law. We hold that the jury’s verdict is supported by sufficient evidence and that the trial court’s determination of unlawful entry was correct as a matter of law, and affirm the judgment.</p>
<p id="e11f3160-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On November 11, 1970, Wiley as lessor and tenant’s predecessor in interest as lessee executed a written lease agreement letting land and a building in Osseo, Minnesota, for use as a restaurant. The lease provided a 5-year term beginning December 1, 1970, and specified that the tenant agreed to bear all costs of repairs and remodeling, to “make no changes in the building structure” without prior written authorization from Wiley, and to “operate the restaurant in a lawful and prudent manner.” Wiley also reserved the right “at [his] option [to] retake possession” of the premises “[s]hould the Lessee fail to meet the conditions of this Lease.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1085C_5eaa12e0-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1085C_5eaa12e0-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">4</a></span> In early 1971, plaintiff Kathleen Berg took assignment of the lease from the prior lessee, and on May 1, 1971, she opened “A Family Affair Restaurant” on the premises. In January 1973, Berg incorporated the restaurant and assigned her interest in the lease to “A Family Affair Restaurant, Inc.” As sole shareholder of the corporation, she alone continued to act for the tenant. [The prior lessee referred to by the court was Phillip Berg, Kathleen’s brother, who ran a pool hall and served low-alcohol beer and small meals on the leased premises from December 1, 1970 (when the lease began), until February 20, 1971 (when Phillip assigned to Kathleen with the consent of Wiley). Kathleen then began remodeling the premises to make them suitable for a restaurant.]</p>
<p id="e11f5875-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The present dispute has arisen out of Wiley’s objection to Berg’s continued remodeling of the restaurant without procuring written permission and her consequent operation of the restaurant in a state of disrepair with alleged health code violations. Strained relations between the parties came to a head in June and July 1973. In a letter dated June 29, 1973, Wiley’s attorney charged Berg with having breached lease items 5 and 6 by making changes in the building structure without written authorization and by operating an unclean kitchen in violation of health regulations. The letter demanded that a list of eight remodeling items be completed within 2 weeks from the date of the letter, by Friday, July 13, 1973, or Wiley would retake possession of the premises under lease item 7. Also, a June 13 inspection of the restaurant by the Minnesota Department of Health had produced an order that certain listed changes be completed within specified time limits in order to comply with the health code. The major items on the inspector’s list, similar to those listed by Wiley’s attorney, were to be completed by July 15, 1973.</p>
<p id="e11f5876-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During the 2-week deadline set by both Wiley and the health department, Berg continued to operate the restaurant without closing to complete the required items of remodeling. The evidence is in dispute as to whether she intended to permanently <span title="310" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-310">p. 310</span>close the restaurant and vacate the premises at the end of the 2 weeks or simply close for about 1 month in order to remodel to comply with the health code. At the close of business on Friday, July 13, 1973, the last day of the 2-week period, Berg dismissed her employees, closed the restaurant, and placed a sign in the window saying “Closed for Remodeling.” Earlier that day, Berg testified, Wiley came to the premises in her absence and attempted to change the locks. When she returned and asserted her right to continue in possession, he complied with her request to leave the locks unchanged. Berg also testified that at about 9:30 P<span class="epub-small-caps">.M</span>. that evening, while she and four of her friends were in the restaurant, she observed Wiley hanging from the awning peering into the window. Shortly thereafter, she heard Wiley pounding on the back door demanding admittance. Berg called the county sheriff to come and preserve order. Wiley testified that he observed Berg and a group of her friends in the restaurant removing paneling from a wall. Allegedly fearing destruction of his property, Wiley called the city police, who, with the sheriff, mediated an agreement between the parties to preserve the status quo until each could consult with legal counsel on Monday, July 16, 1973.</p>
<p id="e11f5877-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Wiley testified that his then attorney advised him to take possession of the premises and lock the tenant out. Accompanied by a police officer and a locksmith, Wiley entered the premises in Berg’s absence and without her knowledge on Monday, July 16, 1973, and changed the locks. Later in the day, Berg found herself locked out. The lease term was not due to expire until December 1, 1975. The premises were re-let to another tenant on or about August 1, 1973. Berg brought this damage action against Wiley and three other named defendants, including the new tenant, on July 27, 1973. A second amended complaint sought damages for lost profits, damage to chattels, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and other tort damages based upon claims in wrongful eviction, contract, and tort. Wiley answered with an affirmative defense of abandonment and surrender and counterclaimed for damage to the premises and indemnification on mechanics lien liability incurred because of Berg’s remodeling. At the close of Berg’s case, all defendants other than Rodney A. Wiley and Wiley Enterprises, Inc., were dismissed from the action. Only Berg’s action for wrongful eviction and intentional infliction of emotional distress and Wiley’s affirmative defense of abandonment and his counterclaim for damage to the premises were submitted by special verdict to the jury. With respect to the wrongful eviction claim, the trial court found as a matter of law that Wiley did in fact lock the tenant out, and that the lockout was wrongful.</p>
<p id="e11f5878-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The jury, by answers to the questions submitted, found no liability on Berg’s claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress and no liability on Wiley’s counterclaim for damages to the premises, but awarded Berg $31,000 for lost profits and $3,540 for loss of chattels resulting from the wrongful lockout. The jury also specifically found that Berg neither abandoned nor surrendered the premises. . . . </p>
<p id="e11f5879-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On this appeal, Wiley seeks an outright reversal of the damages award for wrongful eviction, claiming insufficient evidence to support the jury’s finding of no abandonment or surrender and claiming error in the trial court’s finding of wrongful eviction as a matter of law.</p>
<p id="e11f587a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first issue before us concerns the sufficiency of evidence to support the jury’s finding that Berg had not abandoned or surrendered the leasehold before being locked out by Wiley. Viewing the evidence to support the jury’s special verdict in the light most favorable to Berg, as we must, we hold it amply supports the jury’s finding of no abandonment or surrender of the premises. While the evidence bearing upon Berg’s <span title="311" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-311">p. 311</span>intent was strongly contradictory, the jury could reasonably have concluded, based on Berg’s testimony and supporting circumstantial evidence, that she intended to retain possession, closing temporarily to remodel. Thus, the lockout cannot be excused on the ground that Berg abandoned or surrendered the leasehold.</p>
<p id="e11f587b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second and more difficult issue is whether Wiley’s self-help repossession of the premises by locking out Berg was correctly held wrongful as a matter of law.</p>
<p id="e11f587c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Minnesota has historically followed the common-law rule that a landlord may rightfully use self-help to retake leased premises from a tenant in possession without incurring liability for wrongful eviction provided two conditions are met: (1) The landlord is legally entitled to possession, such as where a tenant holds over after the lease term or where a tenant breaches a lease containing a reentry clause; and (2) the landlord’s means of reentry are peaceable. Mercil v. Broulette, 66 Minn. 416, 69 N.W. 218 (1896). Under the common-law rule, a tenant who is evicted by his landlord may recover damages for wrongful eviction where the landlord either had no right to possession or where the means used to remove the tenant were forcible, or both.</p>
<p id="e11f587d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Wiley contends that Berg had breached the provisions of the lease, thereby entitling Wiley, under the terms of the lease, to retake possession, and that his repossession by changing the locks in Berg’s absence was accomplished in a peaceful manner. In a memorandum accompanying the post-trial order, the trial court stated two grounds for finding the lockout wrongful as a matter of law: (1) It was not accomplished in a peaceable manner and therefore could not be justified under the common-law rule, and (2) any self-help reentry against a tenant in possession is wrongful under the growing modern doctrine that a landlord must always resort to the judicial process to enforce his statutory remedy against a tenant wrongfully in possession. Whether Berg had in fact breached the lease and whether Wiley was hence entitled to possession was not judicially determined. . . . </p>
<p id="e11f587e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In each of our previous cases upholding an award of damages for wrongful eviction, the landlord had in fact been found to have no legal right to possession. In applying the common-law rule, we have not before had occasion to decide what means of self-help used to dispossess a tenant in his absence will constitute a nonpeaceable entry, giving a right to damages without regard to who holds the legal right to possession. Wiley argues that only actual or threatened violence used against a tenant should give rise to damages where the landlord had the right to possession. We cannot agree.</p>
<p id="e11f587f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It has long been the policy of our law to discourage landlords from taking the law into their own hands, and our decisions and statutory law have looked with disfavor upon any use of self-help to dispossess a tenant in circumstances which are likely to result in breaches of the peace. We gave early recognition to this policy in Lobdell v. Keene, 85 Minn. 90, 101, 88 N.W. 426, 430 (1901), where we said:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="e11f7f90-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The object and purpose of the legislature in the enactment of the forcible entry and unlawful detainer statute was to prevent those claiming a right of entry or possession of lands from redressing their own wrongs by entering into possession in a violent and forcible manner. All such acts tend to a breach of the peace, and encourage high-handed oppression. The law does not permit the owner of land, be his title ever so good, to be the judge of his own rights with respect to a possession adversely held, but puts him to his remedy under the statutes.</p>
</div>
<span title="312" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-312">p. 312</span>
<p id="e11f7f91-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To facilitate a resort to judicial process, the legislature has provided a summary procedure in Minn. St. 566.02 to 566.17 whereby a landlord may recover possession of leased premises upon proper notice and showing in court in as little as 3 to 10 days. As we recognized in Mutual Trust Life Ins. Co. v. Berg, 187 Minn. 503, 505, 246 N.W. 9, 10 (1932), “[t]he forcible entry and unlawful detainer statutes were intended to prevent parties from taking the law into their own hands when going into possession of lands and tenements. . . .” To further discourage self-help, our legislature has provided treble damages for forcible evictions, §§557.08 and 557.09, and has provided additional criminal penalties for intentional and unlawful exclusion of a tenant, §504.25. In Sweeney v. Meyers, 199 Minn. 21, 270 N.W. 906 (1937), we allowed a business tenant not only damages for lost profits but also punitive damages against a landlord who, like Wiley, entered in the tenant’s absence and locked the tenant out.</p>
<p id="e11f7f92-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the present case, as in <i>Sweeney</i>, the tenant was in possession, claiming a right to continue in possession adverse to the landlord’s claim of breach of the lease, and had neither abandoned nor surrendered the premises. Wiley, well aware that Berg was asserting her right to possession, retook possession in her absence by picking the locks and locking her out. The record shows a history of vigorous dispute and keen animosity between the parties. Upon this record, we can only conclude that the singular reason why actual violence did not erupt at the moment of Wiley’s changing of the locks was Berg’s absence and her subsequent self-restraint and resort to judicial process. Upon these facts, we cannot find Wiley’s means of reentry peaceable under the common-law rule. Our long-standing policy to discourage self-help which tends to cause a breach of the peace compels us to disapprove the means used to dispossess Berg. To approve this lockout, as urged by Wiley, merely because in Berg’s absence no actual violence erupted while the locks were being changed, would be to encourage all future tenants, in order to protect their possession, to be vigilant and thereby set the stage for the very kind of public disturbance which it must be our policy to discourage. . . . </p>
<p id="e11f7f93-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We recognize that the growing modern trend departs completely from the common-law rule to hold that self-help is never available to dispossess a tenant who is in possession and has not abandoned or voluntarily surrendered the premises. Annotation, 6 A.L.R.3d 177, 186; 76 Dickinson L. Rev. 215, 227. This growing rule is founded on the recognition that the potential for violent breach of peace inheres in any situation where a landlord attempts by his own means to remove a tenant who is claiming possession adversely to the landlord. Courts adopting the rule reason that there is no cause to sanction such potentially disruptive self-help where adequate and speedy means are provided for removing a tenant peacefully through judicial process. At least 16 states have adopted this modern rule, holding that judicial proceedings, including the summary procedures provided in those states’ unlawful detainer statutes, are the exclusive remedy by which a landlord may remove a tenant claiming possession. . . . </p>
<p id="e11f7f94-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While we would be compelled to disapprove the lockout of Berg in her absence under the common-law rule as stated, we approve the trial court’s reasoning and adopt as preferable the modern view represented by the cited cases. To make clear our departure from the common-law rule for the benefit of future landlords and tenants, we hold that, subsequent to our decision in this case, the only lawful means to dispossess a tenant who has not abandoned nor voluntarily surrendered but who claims possession adversely to a landlord’s claim of breach of a written lease is by resort to judicial process. . . . </p>
<span title="313" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-313">p. 313</span>
<p id="e11f7f95-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying our holding to the facts of this case, we conclude, as did the trial court, that because Wiley failed to resort to judicial remedies against Berg’s holding possession adversely to Wiley’s claim of breach of the lease, his lockout of Berg was wrongful as a matter of law. The rule we adopt in this decision is fairly applied against Wiley, for it is clear that, applying the older common-law rule to the facts and circumstances peculiar to this case, we would be compelled to find the lockout nonpeaceable for the reasons previously stated. The jury found that the lockout caused Berg damage and, as between Berg and Wiley, equity dictates that Wiley, who himself performed the act causing the damage, must bear the loss.</p>

<p id="e11fa6ad-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The modern view (and majority rule) on self-help appears to be that in Berg v. Wiley. See Randy D. Gerchick, Comment, No Easy Way Out: Making the Summary Eviction Process a Fairer and More Efficient Alternative to Landlord Self-Help, 41 UCLA L. Rev. 759, 777 (1994) (self-help banned by the majority of states). Nevertheless, some courts continue to permit the exercise of self-help, at least in commercial settings. See, e.g., Northfield Park Associates v. Northeast Ohio Harness, 521 N.E.2d 466 (Ohio Ct. App. 1987). Where self-help is allowed, of course, it must be accomplished without a breach of the peace.</p>

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="e11fa6af-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The movement to prohibit self-help evictions by landlords has long had a few critics, with the most prominent ones suggesting that landlords would pass the high costs of judicially evicting deadbeat tenants onto the tenants who paid their bills on time. Some passing on of these costs undoubtedly occurs, but the reputation revolution suggests a deeper criticism of the prohibitions on landlord self-help. Eviction via self-help typically creates no public records. Courts are not involved in a self-help eviction, and a landlord has no economic incentive to report such a dispossession to a credit bureau or any other information broker. Evictions via summary proceedings, on the other hand, necessarily generate public records, and it is those public records that will prove so damaging to tenants the next time they try to rent an apartment. From the perspective of facilitating tenant rehabilitation and second chances, a law prohibiting self-help by landlords will prove counterproductive. Many tenants who have trouble making rent payments will fail to appreciate the reputational repercussions of involvement in summary proceedings. For these <span title="314" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-314">p. 314</span>tenants, the law’s prohibition on self-help can be a particularly raw deal. This is a point overlooked by defenders of the prohibition on self-help. [Lior J. Strahilevitz, Reputation Nation: Law in an Era of Ubiquitous Personal Information, 102 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1667, 1679-1680 (2008).]</p>
</div>
<p id="e11fa6b0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professor Strahilevitz stresses the costs that prohibiting self-help impose on landlords and says those will be passed on to non-“deadbeat” tenants. What about the costs imposed on tenants of the risk of being wrongfully evicted? Consider how the reasons the court in <i>Berg</i> mentions for prohibiting self-help, especially the landlord’s lack of objectivity regarding the basis for the eviction action, might bear on this question. Suppose, for example, the tenant was not paying rent because of an asserted violation of the warranty of habitability, which we will study in depth later in this chapter. From a strict cost-benefit perspective, the question is whether the error costs of allowing the landlord to be a judge in his own case outweigh the costs of having to go to housing court to procure eviction. There is also a distributive question about who is better positioned to bear the cost, the landlord or the tenant.</p>
<p id="e11fa6b1-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Residential leases.</i></b> Berg v. Wiley involved a commercial lease, but the court’s reasoning would appear to apply to all leases, residential and commercial alike. See also Simpson v. Lee, 499 A.2d 889 (D.C. App. 1985) (self-help prohibited in either instance). In some jurisdictions, the prohibition on self-help applies only to residential leases. Is there any reason to treat the two situations differently? See Case Note, 60 N.C. L. Rev. 885, 891-892 (1982) (loss of residence has greater psychological impact than loss of possession of place of business, and the need for immediate replacement of commercial space is less vital; moreover, in the commercial setting there is more likely to be equal bargaining power between the parties). See also Watson v. Brown, 686 P.2d 12 (Haw. 1984) (permits self-help in commercial tenancies, because of equality of bargaining power; expresses no opinion as to residential tenancies). Of what relevance is equal bargaining power?</p>

Should the parties be permitted to waive the prohibition against self-help repossession? Courts appear to split on this question, but the Restatement view is that the prohibition cannot be contracted away. See Restatement (Second) of Property, Landlord and Tenant §14.2 (1977).</p>

Summary proceedings (sometimes called <i>forcible entry</i> and <i>detainer statutes</i>) are an alternative to the cumbersome, time-consuming, common law procedure called <i>ejectment</i> (which still exists today, with statutory modifications). Today every state provides some form of summary proceeding.</p>
<p id="e11fa6b5-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The typical statute requires only a few days’ notice to the tenant prior to bringing an eviction action, and the range of issues subject to litigation is kept narrow. However, summary eviction procedures can be time-consuming and expensive, even if uncontested, so that summary proceedings can be less summary than one might suppose.</p>

We granted certification in these cases to consider whether a landlord seeking damages from a defaulting tenant is under a duty to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to re-let an apartment wrongfully vacated by the tenant. Separate parts of the Appellate Division held that, in accordance with their respective leases, the landlords in both cases could recover rents due under the leases regardless of whether they had attempted to re-let the vacated apartments. Although they were of different minds as to the fairness of this result, both parts agreed that it was dictated by Joyce v. Bauman, 113 N.J.L. 438, 174 A. 693 (E.&amp;A. 1934), a decision by the former Court of Errors and Appeals. We now reverse and hold that a landlord does have an obligation to make a reasonable effort to mitigate damages in such a situation. We therefore overrule Joyce v. Bauman to the extent that it is inconsistent with our decision today.</p>

<p id="e11fcdd1-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One week after signing the agreement, Kridel paid Sommer $690. Half of that sum was used to satisfy the first month’s rent. The remainder was paid under the lease provision requiring a security deposit of $345.

Although the parties agreed that she was ready, willing and able to rent the apartment, the person in charge told her that the apartment was not being shown since it was already rented to Kridel. In fact, the landlord did not re-enter the apartment or exhibit it to anyone until August 1, 1973. At that time it was rented to a new tenant for a term beginning on September 1, 1973. The new rental was for $345 per month with a six week concession similar to that granted Kridel.</p>
<p id="e11ff3ea-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prior to re-letting the new premises, plaintiff sued Kridel in August 1972, demanding $7,590, the total amount due for the full two-year term of the lease. Following a mistrial, plaintiff filed an amended complaint asking for $5,865, the amount due between May 1, 1972 and September 1, 1973. The amended complaint included no reduction in the claim to reflect the six week concession provided for in the lease or the $690 payment made to plaintiff after signing the agreement. Defendant filed an amended answer to the complaint, alleging that plaintiff breached the contract, failed to mitigate damages and accepted defendant’s surrender of the premises. . . .</p>

Despite his conclusion that the lease had been drawn to reflect “the ‘settled law’ of this state,” he found that “justice and fair dealing” imposed upon the landlord the duty to attempt to re-let the premises and thereby mitigate damages. He also held that plaintiff’s failure to make any response to defendant’s unequivocal offer of surrender was tantamount to an acceptance, thereby terminating the tenancy and any obligation to pay rent. . . .

As in the companion case, the lease prohibited the tenant from subletting or assigning the apartment without the consent of the landlord. It was to run for a two-year term, from February 1, 1973 until January 31, 1975, and provided for a monthly rental of $450.

Similarly, in Heckel v. Griese, [12 N.J. Misc. 211, 171 A. 148 (Sup.

<p id="e1201b0b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Various courts have adopted this position.</p>
<p id="e1201b0c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The pre-existing rule cannot be predicated upon the possibility that a landlord may lose the opportunity to rent another empty apartment because he must first rent the apartment vacated by the defaulting tenant. Even where the breach occurs in a multi-dwelling building, each apartment may have unique qualities which make it attractive to certain individuals. Significantly, in Sommer v. Kridel, there was a specific request to rent the apartment vacated by the defendant; there is no reason to believe that absent this vacancy the landlord could have succeeded in renting a different apartment to this individual.</p>
<p id="e1201b0d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We therefore hold that antiquated real property concepts which served as the basis for the pre-existing rule, shall no longer be controlling where there is a claim for damages under a residential lease. Such claims must be governed by more modern <span title="319" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-319">p. 319</span>notions of fairness and equity. A landlord has a duty to mitigate damages where he seeks to recover rents due from a defaulting tenant.</p>
<p id="e1201b0e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the landlord has other vacant apartments besides the one which the tenant has abandoned, the landlord’s duty to mitigate consists of making reasonable efforts to re-let the apartment. In such cases he must treat the apartment in question as if it was one of his vacant stock.</p>
<p id="e1201b0f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As part of his cause of action, the landlord shall be required to carry the burden of proving that he used reasonable diligence in attempting to re-let the premises. We note that there has been a divergence of opinion concerning the allocation of the burden of proof on this issue. While generally in contract actions the breaching party has the burden of proving that damages are capable of mitigation, here the landlord will be in a better position to demonstrate whether he exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to re-let the premises.</p>
<p id="e1201b10-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Sommer v. Kridel case presents a classic example of the unfairness which occurs when a landlord has no responsibility to minimize damages. Sommer waited 15 months and allowed $4,658.50 in damages to accrue before attempting to re-let the apartment. Despite the availability of a tenant who was ready, willing and able to rent the apartment, the landlord needlessly increased the damages by turning her away. While a tenant will not necessarily be excused from his obligations under a lease simply by finding another person who is willing to rent the vacated premises, see, e.g., Regent v. Dempsey-Tegler &amp; Co., 70 Ill. App. 2d 32, 216 N.E.2d 500 (Ill. App. 1966) (new tenant insisted on leasing the premises under different terms); Edmands v. Rust &amp; Richardson Drug Co., 191 Mass. 123, 77 N.E. 713 (1906) (landlord need not accept insolvent tenant), here there has been no showing that the new tenant would not have been suitable. We therefore find that plaintiff could have avoided the damages which eventually accrued, and that the defendant was relieved of his duty to continue paying rent. Ordinarily we would require the tenant to bear the cost of any reasonable expenses incurred by a landlord in attempting to re-let the premises, . . . but no such expenses were incurred in this case.</p>
<p id="e1201b11-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Riverview Realty Co. v. Perosio, no factual determination was made regarding the landlord’s efforts to mitigate damages, and defendant contends that plaintiff never answered his interrogatories. Consequently, the judgment is reversed and the case remanded for a new trial. Upon remand and after discovery has been completed, R. 4:17 et seq., the trial court shall determine whether plaintiff attempted to mitigate damages with reasonable diligence, . . . and if so, the extent of damages remaining and assessable to the tenant. As we have held above, the burden of proving that reasonable diligence was used to re-let the premises shall be upon the plaintiff.</p>
<p id="e1201b12-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In assessing whether the landlord has satisfactorily carried his burden, the trial court shall consider, among other factors, whether the landlord, either personally or through an agency, offered or showed the apartment to any prospective tenants, or advertised it in local newspapers. Additionally, the tenant may attempt to rebut such evidence by showing that he proffered suitable tenants who were rejected. However, there is no standard formula for measuring whether the landlord has utilized satisfactory efforts in attempting to mitigate damages, and each case must be judged upon its own facts. Compare Hershorin v. La Vista, Inc., 110 Ga. App. 435, 138 S.E.2d 703 (App. 1964) (“reasonable effort” of landlord by showing the apartment to all prospective tenants); Carpenter v. Wisniewski, 139 Ind.

Oppenstein, 335 F.2d 801, 811 (8 Cir. 1964) (dictum) (demand for rent which is “far greater than the provisions of the lease called for” negates landlord’s assertion that he acted in good faith in seeking a new tenant).</p>

<p id="e1201b16-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ezra Rosser, a law professor at American University Washington College of Law, interviewed James Kridel and kindly reported to us the following:</p>
<p id="e1204227-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Kridel was a law student at the time his problems arose; once he graduated he worked on his case after hours at the firm that hired him. The litigation consumed seven years and about $500,000 in fees; the cost to print the briefs on appeal exceeded the $800 the case could have been settled for at the outset. After Kridel lost at one stage in the appeals process, a local newspaper wrote a story about Sommer v. Kridel with the title “Engagement Broke But Not Lease.” A lengthy brief Kridel submitted relied in part on an Oregon case, prompting his adversary to dismiss the case as being from Oregon, “a state whose principal industries are logging and salmon.” When Kridel eventually won (based in part on the Oregon case), he sent that lawyer a salmon and some wood wrapped in a copy of the court’s ruling; the lawyer responded by sending back the message “Touché.” One of the justices hearing Kridel’s appeal had to recuse himself because his son had been in the army with Kridel and was going to lend money to Kridel if Kridel lost his case (the justice figured his son would borrow the funds from him!). A grandson of Justice Pashman, the author of the opinion in the case, ended up being a tenant of Kridel’s.</p>

<p id="e120422a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Rationales for the no-duty-to-mitigate rule.</i></b> Various justifications are given for the rule, jettisoned in <i>Sommer</i>, that a landlord is under no obligation to mitigate damages in the event of abandonment by a tenant: The tenant cannot by his own wrongdoing impose a duty on the landlord; the tenant has “purchased” an interest in real estate (and, presumably, is stuck with it); the landlord should not be forced into a personal relationship with a new tenant he does not wish to <span title="321" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-321">p. 321</span>accept; the landlord should not be required to seek out new tenants “continually.” See Annot., 75 A.L.R.5th 1, 42-62 (2000). The Restatement offers another consideration in support of its surprising position against a duty of mitigation: “Abandonment of property is an invitation to vandalism, and the law should not encourage such conduct by putting a duty of mitigation of damages on the landlord.” Restatement (Second) of Property, Landlord and Tenant §12.1 comment i at 392 (1977). Are any of these points compelling?</p>
<p id="e120422b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Surrender and abandonment.</i></b> Suppose that in <i>Sommer</i> the landlord, Sommer, had been more sympathetic with James Kridel’s predicament and agreed to terminate his tenancy prematurely. Such an agreement by landlord and tenant prematurely to terminate a tenancy is called a <i>surrender</i>, and if effected, a surrender relieves the tenant from liability for future rent (although the tenant remains liable for any past unpaid rent). Normally, an express surrender is subject to the Statute of Frauds, and if the lease had to be in writing, so must the surrender.</p>
<p id="e120422c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Abandonment</i> is another way in which a surrender can be effected—through an <i>implied</i> surrender rather than an express surrender. Restatement (Second) of Property, Landlord and Tenant, supra, §12.1 comment i, defines abandonment this way: “An abandonment of the leased property by the tenant occurs when he vacates the leased property without justification and without any present intention of returning and he defaults in the payment of rent.” The tenant’s abandonment is considered to be an implied offer to surrender, which the landlord is free to accept (thereby effecting a surrender) or reject.</p>
<p id="e120422d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>The landlord’s options—the traditional view.</i></b> Traditionally, the landlord had three options where the tenant abandoned:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="e120422e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Terminate the lease</i>. The landlord could treat the abandonment as an implied offer to surrender and accept the offer, thereby terminating the lease.</p></li>
<li><p id="e120422f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Leave premises vacant; recover accrued rent</i>. Rejecting the implied offer to surrender and keeping the lease in effect, the landlord could leave the premises vacant and later bring an action for accrued unpaid rent.</p></li>
<li><p id="e1204230-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Mitigate damages; recover any difference in rent</i>. Rejecting the implied offer to surrender and keeping the lease in effect, the landlord could mitigate the tenant’s damages by reletting the premises to a third party and bringing an action against the tenant to recover any difference in the rent.</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="e1206941-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>The modern rule and its rationale.</i></b> Although <i>Sommer</i> refers to the no-mitigation rule as the majority rule, this is no longer accurate. A majority of jurisdictions now impose a duty to mitigate. See Stephanie G. Flynn, Duty to Mitigate Damages Upon a Tenant’s Abandonment, 34 Real Prop., Prob. &amp; Tr. J. 721 (2000). Most of the jurisdictions impose the duty only as to residential leases. In jurisdictions that impose the duty by virtue of judicial reform, some decisions recognize the duty as a default term subject to waiver by the parties. Are there good reasons to impose the duty only in the residential setting?</p>
<p id="e1206942-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rationales for the duty to mitigate are relevant to the question. The opinion in <i>Sommer</i> mentions “modern notions of fairness and equity.” Considerations of efficiency also enter in. In Austin Hill Country Realty, Inc. v. Palisades Plaza, Inc., 948 S.W. 2d 293 (Texas 1997), for example, the court observed that the old common law rule (no duty to mitigate) “encourages both economic and physical waste. . . . A mitigation requirement thus returns the property to productive use <span title="322" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-322">p. 322</span>rather than allowing it to remain idle.” Relatedly, it helps prevent property damage. “If the landlord is encouraged to let the property remain unoccupied, ‘the possibility of physical damage to the property through accident or vandalism is increased.”’ 948 S.W.2d at 298. (Compare in this connection the Restatement’s views about vandalism, mentioned in Note 1 above.)</p>
<p id="e1206943-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. <i>Fulfilling the duty to mitigate—the “vacant stock” idea.</i></b> The court in <i>Sommer</i> held that a landlord must treat abandoned premises as part of his “vacant stock” (page 319); presumably, then, the landlord must make at least the same effort to rent the abandoned premises as he makes to rent other vacant units. Is this justified by the rationale that the rent the landlord “receives from the substitute tenant is . . . a gain <i>enabled</i> by the breach of contract by the first tenant”? See Richard A. Posner, Economic Analysis of Law 134 (9th ed. 2014).</p>

<p id="e1206945-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Security deposits</i>. Most people have had (often unpleasant) experience with security deposits. The purposes of such deposits—to protect the landlord in the event a tenant defaults in rent, damages the premises, or otherwise breaches the lease—are straightforward, but there is some evidence that things get bent in practice. In principle, the landlord is obliged to return to the tenant, upon termination of the lease, the deposit less any amounts necessary to compensate for defaults by the tenant. In practice, the landlord has an incentive to imagine all sorts of reasons why he should be entitled to retain the deposit, and with money in hand he has leverage that permits abuse. This, at least, is the central concern; justified or not, it has led to a good deal of reform—most of it statutory. The following provisions are typical: limits are placed on the amount of deposits (e.g., two months’ rent); deposits must be placed in a trust or escrow account; deposits are not to be commingled with other funds; the tenant’s claim to a deposit is made prior to other creditors, including, in some instances, a trustee in bankruptcy; the landlord must pay interest on deposits; the landlord must submit an itemized list of deductions from a deposit; and penalties are levied for violations (e.g., double or treble the amount of the deposit, or some fixed sum).</p>

<p id="e1206948-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This section discusses the duties of the landlord once a lease has begun. We give special emphasis to the landlord’s duties with regard to the condition of the premises because this is the area in which there has been the greatest amount of doctrinal change in landlord-tenant law, especially residential landlord-tenant law, within the past 50 years. We begin, however, with the landlord’s initial duty to deliver possession to the tenant.</p>

<p id="e120694b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose that <i>L</i> and <i>T</i> have entered into a lease to begin on the first of January. On that date, <i>T</i> arrives at the premises, ready to take possession, only to find a former <span title="323" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-323">p. 323</span>tenant holding over. Is this <i>L</i>’s problem, or <i>T</i>’s? Could there be any question? Actually, the answer is yes, or maybe (or, better), it depends upon where this occurs. The jurisdictions are divided between two rules, with case support for both. Under the so-called <i>American rule</i>, the landlord is obligated only to deliver legal possession; i.e., the legal right to possession of the premises when the lease term begins. The upshot is that it is the tenant’s responsibility, rather than the landlord’s, to oust a trespasser or holdover. The tenant’s remedies are against the person wrongfully in possession: he may sue to recover possession and damages.</p>
<p id="e120905c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the so-called <i>English rule</i>, the landlord must deliver not merely legal, but actual possession. Upon the landlord’s default, the tenant may terminate the lease and sue for damages. Alternatively, the new tenant may continue the lease and sue for damages. See 1 American Law of Property §3.37 (A.J. Casner ed. 1952).</p>
<p id="e120905d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The policy bases of the two rules? The American rule is thought “to be founded on the argument that the tenant has sufficient legal and equitable remedies available to protect himself against the third party wrongfully in possession and a greater incentive to use them than the landlord would have.” Restatement (Second) of Property, Landlord and Tenant, supra, §6.2 Reporter’s Note at 245. The English rule, like much else of modern landlord-tenant law, is based on the view that the landlord has the greater ability to guard against the risk of trespassers and holdovers. Moreover, it is commonly said that most landlords these days, especially in the residential context, are more sophisticated about the eviction process and better able to bear costs thereof.</p>
<p id="e120905e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A majority of jurisdictions now follows the English rule. So also do the Restatement (Second) of Property, Landlord and Tenant §6.2 (1977) and the Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (URLTA) §2.103. The former permits the parties to agree otherwise; the latter, it appears, does not (see URLTA §1.403).</p>

<p id="e1209061-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is now common to say that a “revolution” has occurred in residential landlord-tenant law. As one commentator summarizes the change, “[t]he residential tenant, long the stepchild of the law has now become its ward and darling. Tenants’ rights have increased dramatically; landlords’ rights have decreased dramatically.” Edward H. Rabin, The Revolution in Residential Landlord-Tenant Law: Causes and Consequences, 69 Cornell L. Rev. 517, 519 (1984). Beginning in the 1960s, courts began to develop legal doctrines aimed at addressing the appallingly bad housing conditions in many low-income areas of the nation’s cities. Courts and commentators often characterize this revolution by saying that it involves rejection of a “property” model of leases in favor of a “contract” model. This characterization is somewhat inaccurate, however. The legal doctrines that form the core of the revolution are not always consistent with contract law — at least not entirely so. It is more accurate to say that these doctrines are a hybrid of traditional property and contract law. The clearest change that these doctrines signify is a rejection of the traditional common law approach to defining the landlord’s duties regarding the care of the premises, an approach that was based on a model of leasehold covenants as independent.</p>
<div class="epub-feature epub-feature3 ">
<span title="324" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-324">p. 324</span><div class="epub-feature-heading2 cc-font-medium epub-text-center"><p id="e1209063-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-center"><i>THE ORIGINAL COMMON LAW APPROACH:<br>INDEPENDENT COVENANTS</i></p></div>
<p id="e1209064-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As we saw earlier, the common law treated a lease as both a conveyance of an estate and a contract. As a contract, the lease is a bundle of covenants, some of which the parties expressly made and others of which the law implied. For example, the law implied a <i>covenant of title</i> running from the landlord to the tenant. This made sense because at a time when no system of keeping records to land titles existed, the landlord was in the best position to know whether he had good legal title to convey to the tenant.</p>
<p id="e1209065-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A major difference between landlord-tenant law and the law of contracts is that unlike contract law, leasehold covenants, whether express or implied, were considered independent of each other. That is, covenants had to be performed regardless of whether the other party’s covenants had been performed. So, for example, even if a landlord had expressly covenanted to repair the premises and failed to perform the covenant, the tenant was still obligated to perform all of his covenants, including, notably, the covenant to pay rent.</p>
<p id="e120b776-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There was one major exception to this independent covenants approach: the obligation to pay rent was dependent upon the tenant’s having possession undisturbed by the landlord (or someone claiming through the landlord). An important covenant running from the landlord to the tenant that the common law implied was the <i>covenant of quiet enjoyment</i>. Originally, this meant that the landlord promised not to interfere with the tenant’s right to actually possess the land during the term of the lease. This covenant was so central to the parties’ relationship that a breach of this covenant by the landlord (or anyone under the landlord’s authority) would discharge the tenant’s duty under the covenant to pay rent.</p>
<p id="e120b777-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The covenant of quiet enjoyment was initially limited to cases in which the tenant was actually ousted physically. As time went on, however, courts expanded its scope to include actions by the landlord (and those acting under him) that so substantially interfered with the tenant’s beneficial enjoyment of the premises that the tenant has no reasonable alternative but to vacate the premises. Under these circumstances, the courts said that there was a <i>constructive eviction</i>. For purposes of the tenant’s obligation to pay rent, a constructive eviction was the equivalent of an actual eviction—it discharged the tenant’s duty to pay rent. But the development of the constructive eviction doctrine opened further questions: what actions by the landlord might lead to a constructive eviction? Did <i>in</i>actions by the landlord count as well as positive acts, and if so, under what circumstances? What if the interfering acts were committed by third parties rather than by the landlord? How much interference with the tenant’s beneficial enjoyment must occur before a tenant is justified in vacating the premises and claiming constructive eviction? We consider these and other questions in the section that follows.</p>
</div>
<p id="e120b778-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Disputes between landlord and tenant regarding the condition of the premises arise in essentially two ways. First, the tenant might wish to vacate, or to stay but pay less (or no) rent. Second, the tenant (or an invitee of the tenant) might be injured by allegedly defective premises and claim damages against the landlord in tort. The materials below concentrate on the first sort of dispute, but give some attention to the second as well.</p>

<p id="e120b784-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Pursuant to the provisions of the Lease, the MCPO was to rent 9,356 square feet of lower level space in the Victoria Centre for a period of seven years and five months, commencing on August 1, 1999. The payment obligations increased over time, beginning with zero dollars owed per month for the first five months, increasing to $8,576.33 per month for months seventy-eight through eighty-nine of the lease term.</p>
<p id="e120b785-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the Lease provisions, Landlord was required to maintain all equipment used in common with other tenants—such as elevators, plumbing, heating and similar equipment—and to maintain the premises in good order, condition and repair. In the event of breach by Landlord, the lease provided that the MCPO could “sue for injunctive relief or to recover damages for any loss resulting from the breach, but [it] shall not be entitled to terminate this Lease or withhold, setoff or abate any rent due thereunder.”</p>
<p id="e120b786-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Beginning in 2001, there was a series of water intrusions from the outside and leaks from building equipment, which damaged property secured by the MCPO and affected the areas that the MCPO occupied or used. On March 11, 2001, there was a leak in the restroom area. On June 25, 2001, there was a leak in the MCPO’s evidence room. On August 2, 2001, there was leak in what the MCPO refers to as its war room, a room that extends out from the building underneath a sidewalk adjacent to the building. On August 16, 2001, there was leak in the electrical conduit. On August 24 and 28, 2001, Landlord took an inventory of water spots on ceiling tiles and other water damage throughout the MCPO’s leased area and noted several spots and other <span title="326" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-326">p. 326</span>damage that had been caused by sweating pipes or leaks. On August 28 and September 10, 2001, leaks were again noted in the war room, which were either caused by cracks in the sidewalk or steam from Indianapolis Power and Light’s underground pipes.</p>
<p id="e120b787-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a result of repeated water intrusions in the war room, Landlord hired Indoor Air Management (IAM) to conduct microbiological sampling and visual inspections. IAM reported visual signs of water damage in the war room and along dry wall. Landlord caulked and sprayed sealant on the sidewalk above the war room on several occasions, but these actions did not stop the leaking. The drywall was scheduled to be repaired, but another leak delayed the work. Landlord sought an estimate to remove and re-pour the concrete sidewalk above the war room on October 11, 2001. However, Landlord elected not to perform this work due to the estimated costs.</p>
<p id="e120b788-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another leak was discovered outside of an office on January 22, 2002, and was noticeably worse on January 29, 2002. On Memorial Day 2002, the main water supply pipe in the building’s air conditioning system broke causing a leak in the evidence room. Approximately seventy boxes of evidence were damaged. The MCPO had to dedicate several person-hours to attend to the damaged evidence. On June 10, 2002, Mold Remediation Services (MRS) inspected the damaged evidence room and detected mold spores. MRS provided Landlord a quoted price for recommended work to address the microbial contamination. However, due to the estimated cost of the remediation services, Landlord did not hire MRS, but rather permitted its maintenance man to perform demolition and replace drywall. Landlord’s maintenance man did not perform several of the tasks recommended by MRS.</p>
<p id="e120b789-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On July 17, 2002, nearly one year after the original leak in the war room, Landlord’s maintenance man again replaced ceiling tiles that showed signs of water damage. On July 19, 2002, IAM performed microbiological testing in the main evidence room, hallway, conference room and office of the Chief Deputy Prosecutor of the Grand Jury Division, Mark Hollingsworth (Hollingsworth). IAM informed the MCPO that additional demolition was necessary and that the boxes that were damaged should be discarded because of microbiological contamination.</p>
<p id="e120b78a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On July 31, 2002, a new leak caused by the HVAC system was discovered in the break room. On August 2, 2002, IAM reported that moisture readings collected from drywall in the closet area were elevated. A wall in the war room had visible signs of water damage. Also, different types of mold spores were present inside the premises than those found outdoors. Surface testing reported excessive fungal growth. IAM recommended several actions to deal with the moisture and microbiological problems, many of which were previously recommended by MRS.</p>
<p id="e120de9b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Landlord spoke with IAM and was advised regarding the possibility of allergic reactions for certain people to mold contamination. However, after this meeting Landlord advised the MCPO there were no health risks presented by the building conditions. At least one of the MCPO employees complained of suffering from unusual coughing and sneezing for a prolonged period of time. Another of the MCPO employees experienced headaches while working at the leased premises. The employee reported his symptoms to a physician, was reassigned outside of the leased premises, and the symptoms subsided. On August 13, 2002, Landlord and the MCPO met with an IAM employee to discuss IAM’s report. IAM’s employee explained to the MCPO there was an elevated mold count, but not the type of mold that requires a building to be quarantined.</p>

The employee reported to Hollingsworth that there were moisture problems in three of the four rooms the MCPO Grand Jury Division used to store evidence. Landlord sent a letter to the MCPO on October 14, 2002, suggesting the MCPO move evidence that it was storing and other materials away from parts of the premises that were vulnerable to water damage. On November 25, 2002, there was a sewage leak in Hollingsworth’s office. On January 9, 2003, a water intrusion was discovered in the women’s restroom, causing it to be closed for approximately three weeks. The phone system for the MCPO Grand Jury Division went out on January 27, 2003, and MCPO employees took photographs of water damage on the phone board. On January 28, 2003, a major water intrusion was discovered in the main evidence room. An employee photographed a stream of water pouring from the ceiling.</p>
<p id="e120de9d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On January 30, 2003, the MCPO elected to vacate the leased premises, and moved to a location where another of the MCPO’s divisions was located. Also, January 2003, was the last month that the MCPO paid rent to Landlord, leaving three years and eleven months, or $380,477.37, unpaid according to the terms of the Lease.</p>
<p id="e120de9e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On February 23, 2004, Landlord filed a Complaint against the MCPO, alleging that the MCPO breached the Lease, and sought the damages provided under the Lease. The MCPO filed its answer on April 14, 2004, asserting affirmative defenses and a counterclaim premised on a wrongful eviction theory. In its counterclaim, MCPO initially alleged that it had been constructively evicted in January 2003. On July 18, 2005, the MCPO sought leave to amend its counterclaim, stating that the January 2003 allegation had been an error in dates. To correct that error in the amended counterclaim, the MCPO changed an allegation that it was constructively evicted in August 2002.</p>
<p id="e120de9f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On January 9 through 11, 2007, the trial court held a bench trial. Thereafter, the parties submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Ind. Trial Rule 52(C). The trial court’s judgment held that: (1) the MCPO’s defenses and counterclaim were not barred by the Lease’s exclusive-remedy provisions; (2) the MCPO was “actually” evicted in October 2002 and then “constructively” evicted in January 2003; and (3) assuming the Landlord could recover against the MCPO, the Landlord did not mitigate its damages reasonably. MCPO was awarded $7,664 and costs on its wrongful eviction counterclaim. . . .</p>

<p id="e120dea3-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Landlord argues that the trial court’s judgment is clearly erroneous because it ignored the exclusive-remedy provision of the Lease by concluding that the MCPO had been constructively evicted. Specifically, Landlord argues that the exclusive-remedy provision is permissible under Indiana law and the trial court erred by granting MCPO a remedy prohibited by that provision.</p>
<p id="e120dea4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Indiana courts have recognized the contractual nature of leases and the applicability of the law of contracts to leases. The construction of a written contract is a question of law. When interpreting a contract, our paramount goal is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the parties.

<p id="e120deaa-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court found that the MCPO was actually evicted from the leased premises beginning in October of 2002, and was then constructively evicted as of January 28, 2003, due to repeated and un-remedied water intrusions. In explaining the theories of eviction, our supreme court stated the following:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="e120deab-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Eviction is either actual or constructive, actual when the tenant is deprived of the occupancy of some part of the demised premises, and constructive when the lessor, without intending to oust the lessee, does an act by which the latter is deprived of the beneficial enjoyment of some part of the premises, in which case the tenant has his right of election, to quit, and avoid the lease and rent, or abide the wrong and seek his remedy in an action for the trespass. But in every case of constructive eviction the tenant must quit the premises if he would relieve himself from liability to pay rent; and whether or not he is justifiable in so quitting is a question for the jury. [Talbott v. English, 156 Ind. 299, 307-308, 59 N.E. 857, 860 (1901).]</p>
</div>
<p id="e120deac-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In further explaining the nature of actual eviction and the effects thereof on the obligations of a tenant, the <i>Talbott</i> court stated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="e120dead-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It may be said that in every lease there is an implied covenant that the tenant shall have the right of possession, occupancy, and beneficial use of every portion of the leased premises. The tenant is regarded as having hired the use of the <span title="329" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-329">p. 329</span>property as an entirety, and therefore if the landlord, after the grant, deprives the tenant of the possession and enjoyment of any part of the premises, the landlord shall not be entitled to any part of the rent during the time he thus deprives the tenant of this rights. The landlord may not apportion the rent by his own wrong. [Id. at 859.]</p>
</div>
<p id="e120deae-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have more recently articulated this concept by stating: “The general rule is that a tenant will be relieved of any obligation to pay further rent if the landlord deprives the tenant of possession and beneficial use and enjoyment of any part of the demised premises by actual eviction. . . . Stated differently, after termination <i>the lease and all liability under it for future rent are extinguished</i>.” Gigax v. Boone Village Ltd. Partnership, 656 N.E.2d 854, 858 (Ind. Ct. App. 1995) (emphasis in original).</p>
<p id="e120deaf-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In [Sigsbee v. Swathwood, 419 N.E.2d 789, 796 (Ind. Ct. App. 1981], we summarized the theory of constructive eviction by explaining: “If an act or omission by the lessor materially deprives the lessee of the beneficial use or enjoyment of the lease property, the lessee may elect to abandon the property and avoid further obligations under the lease. If the lessee so elects, the abandonment of the property must occur within a reasonable time after the act or omission.” Thus, if a landlord commits acts or omissions sufficient to actually evict the tenant, the tenant is no longer obligated to pay rent. And likewise, if a landlord commits acts or omissions sufficient to constructively evict the tenant, and the tenant leaves within a reasonable period, the tenant is no longer obligated to pay rent under the lease.</p>
<p id="e120deb0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, the trial court concluded that “it would be contrary to public policy to permit a landlord to completely eliminate a Tenant’s remedy of constructive eviction if conditions are such that the leased property is unusable.” However, we find that it is unnecessary to resort to a consideration of public policy to determine this dispute since the unambiguous terms of the exclusive-remedy provision did not prohibit Landlord from evicting the MCPO. The exclusive-remedy provision limited only the MCPO’s ability to “terminate this Lease or withhold, setoff or abate any rent due thereunder.” Upon the occurrence of eviction, either actual or constructive, it is the lessor’s act or omission that ends the obligation to pay rent, not the lessee. Therefore, since we conclude below that the trial court’s findings that the MCPO had been wrongfully evicted were not clearly erroneously, we hold that it was the Landlord’s own act or omission that resulted in extinguishing MCPO’s future rent payment obligations.</p>
<p id="e120deb1-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center ">[B]. MCPO Was Wrongfully Evicted</p>
<p id="e120deb2-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Landlord contends that the trial court erred when it found that the MCPO had been evicted. Specifically, Landlord argues that the uncontroverted testimony, largely by the MCPO’s own witnesses, contradict the findings and conclusions entered by the trial court, and therefore are clearly erroneous and should be reversed.</p>
<p id="e120deb3-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In reviewing the record, we observe that the trial court concluded that Landlord actually evicted the MCPO in October of 2002 when “Landlord informed the [MCPO] to refrain from using those portions of the leased space ‘most vulnerable to water.’ ” We also observe the trial court concluded the MCPO was “constructively evicted as of January 28, 2003, due to repeated un-remedied water intrusions.”</p>
<p id="e120deb4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As we stated above, actual eviction occurs when a tenant is deprived of a material part of the leased premises, and constructive eviction occurs when an interference <span title="330" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-330">p. 330</span>with possession so serious that it deprives the lessee of the beneficial enjoyment of the leased premises. When a transitory and fleeting interference by the lessor with the lessee’s possession occurs, there is no eviction, but a mere trespass, for which the lessee is entitled to damages.</p>
<p id="e12105c5-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In challenging the trial court’s conclusion of eviction, . . . Landlord argues that testimony by employees or agents of the MCPO, stating that each incident of water intrusions and related problems were temporary or eventually fixed, is uncontroverted evidence which shows that the trial court’s findings of both actual and constructive eviction are clearly erroneous. To the contrary, when reviewing the record, we find substantial evidence supporting the trial court’s findings that the water intrusions were recurring, which in turn supports a finding that they were not transitory or fleeting. Moreover, it was Landlord who suggested to the MCPO that it should move evidence and materials out of areas of the leased premises that were vulnerable to water, showing the Landlord’s acknowledgement that water leaks would recur. Additionally, this evidence supports the trial court’s findings that the MCPO was deprived of a material part of the leased premises by these water intrusions and related problems. . . . </p>

<p id="e12105ca-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>The covenant of quiet enjoyment.</i></b> As the court notes in <i>Village Commons</i>, “in every lease there is an implied covenant that the tenant shall have the right of possession, occupancy, and beneficial use of every portion of the leased premises.” (See page 328, quoting from an earlier decision.) Originally, this covenant of quiet enjoyment, as it is customarily called, was developed to protect a tenant against wrongful eviction by the landlord or someone claiming under the landlord. The common law at one time viewed all promises in leases—a promise, say, on the part of the landlord to keep the premises in repair—as independent, such that a breach by the landlord gave the tenant a cause of action for damages, but not the right to suspend rent payments or to terminate the tenancy, but with this exception: in the event of a wrongful eviction, the tenant could treat the lease and the obligation to pay rent as terminated. Expressed in terms of contract doctrine, the tenant’s obligation was dependent on not being evicted by the landlord.</p>
<p id="e12105cb-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Early on, the covenant of quiet enjoyment was held to be breached only by wrongful physical eviction, but with time it was expanded to include other landlord breaches that interfered with tenants’ beneficial enjoyment of the leased premises. This was obviously sensible—otherwise landlords could simply make tenants miserable, without actually ousting them—but it was also obviously limited, at least in theory. The early common law imposed on landlords no duty to provide suitable premises. As a matter of principle, then, the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment would be breached only when the landlord’s conduct had “the effect of depriving the lessee of the beneficial use of the demised premises, whether by positive acts of interference or by withholding something essential to full enjoyment <i>and included</i> <i>within the terms of the lease</i>.” 1 American Law of Property, supra, §3.51 at 280 (emphasis added). But given the <span title="331" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-331">p. 331</span>absence of a common law duty on the landlord’s part, what if anything would be “included within the terms of the lease”?</p>
<p id="e12105cc-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One clear answer is that an explicit clause in the lease, or a statutory requirement, might express certain landlord obligations (to provide heat, to make repairs, and so on). And the common law gradually developed exceptions to the general no-landlord-duty rule. An early exception concerned short-term leases of furnished dwellings, as to which landlords had an implied duty to make and keep the premises habitable. Additional exceptions developed such that landlords had the duty to disclose latent defects in the premises that existed at the time the lease was entered into, were or should have been known by the landlord, and were not apparent on reasonable inspection by the tenant; to maintain common areas used by all the tenants in a building; to undertake carefully any repairs the landlord promised or volunteered to make; to abstain from fraudulent misrepresentations as to the condition of the leased premises; and, in some jurisdictions, to abate immoral conduct and other nuisances that occurred on property owned by the landlord if they affected the leased premises.</p>
<p id="e12105cd-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There was no problem of landlord duty in <i>Village Commons</i>, because the lease in the case expressly required the landlord to maintain all equipment used in common with other tenants and to maintain the premises in good order, condition, and repair. It seems to be increasingly the case, however, that no such lease provisions are required, and no common law exceptions need be brought into play, in order to pin liability on landlords. Instead, the covenant of quiet enjoyment is taken to create, of itself, a duty upon the part of landlords to provide suitable premises. See, e.g., Reste Realty Corp. v. Cooper, 251 A.2d 268 (N.J. 1969); Max P. Rapacz, Origin and Evolution of Constructive Eviction in the United States, 1 DePaul L. Rev. 69 (1951).</p>
<p id="e12105ce-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>The idea of constructive eviction.</i></b> As noted above, the lease obligations of a tenant are dependent on not being wrongfully evicted by the landlord. Just what does “eviction” mean? As explained in <i>Village Commons</i> (see page 328), eviction might mean being physically removed or kept out by the landlord, in which case there is an actual eviction. But further to aid the cause of tenants, courts developed the idea of constructive eviction. If (a) the condition of the leased premises amounts to a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, and (b) the breach is so substantial as to justify the tenant absenting the premises, and (c) the tenant thereafter leaves within a reasonable time, then it was as though the tenant has been evicted (the eviction was “constructive”). And once evicted, of course, the tenant is relieved of the obligation to pay rent. Q.E.D.</p>
<p id="e12105cf-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Elements of the covenant of quiet enjoyment</i> <i>and constructive eviction.</i></b> To prove breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and constructive eviction, the tenant must establish three elements: (1) <i>wrongful conduct</i> by the landlord (or someone for whom the landlord is legally responsible); (2) <i>substantial interference</i> with the tenant’s use and enjoyment; and (3) <i>vacation</i> of the premises in a timely fashion.</p>

In general, inaction by the landlord is wrongful only where the landlord is under a duty to act. Such a duty can exist on the basis, for example, of an express clause in the lease, such as a covenant to make repairs. Statutes may also impose a duty on the landlord to act in certain ways (e.g., provide heat). Apart from the lease and statutes, as we will discuss later in this section, the early common law imposed no duty on the landlord to keep the premises in good repair or in habitable condition. There were, however, a few limited exceptions to this general rule: (1) the <i>furnished-dwelling rule</i>: as to short-term leases of furnished dwellings, there was an implied duty to make and keep the premises habitable; (2) <i>common areas</i>: the landlord was responsible for the care and condition of common areas (e.g., hallways, shared walkways); (3) <i>latent defects</i>: the landlord was under a duty to disclose latent defects existing at the outset of the lease of which the landlord knew or reasonably should have known; and (4) <i>nuisances</i>: in some jurisdictions, the landlord is responsible for abatement of nuisances occurring on the premises if they affect the leased premises.</p>
<p id="e12105d3-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts have not always been so careful about identifying the independent source of the landlord’s duty in finding a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. In Reste Realty Corp. v. Cooper, for example, the New Jersey Supreme Court said that “any act or omission of the landlord . . . which renders the premises substantially unsuitable for the purpose for which they are leased, or which seriously interferes with the beneficial enjoyment of the premises” constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and a constructive eviction if the tenant vacates in a timely fashion. On this view, the covenant of quiet enjoyment itself becomes a source of a duty to act.</p>
<p id="e12105d4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">→ <u>Acts of third parties</u>. The traditional rule is that landlords are not responsible for the acts of third parties. Today jurisdictions are divided on the question. Although some adhere to the traditional rule, others have held that the landlord is responsible for controlling the third party’s conduct if the landlord has the legal authority to do so. In Blackett v. Olanoff, 358 N.E.2d 817 (Mass. 1977), for example, the court found a constructive eviction where loud noise from a bar near the tenant’s apartment and which the landlord owned and leased to another party led the tenant to vacate his apartment after the landlord failed to take steps to abate the noise despite repeated requests to do so. The court found that the landlord had it within his control to correct the problem because the lease for the bar expressly provided that entertainment in the bar had to be conducted so that it would not disturb the nearby neighbors.</p>

<p id="e12105d8-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A tenant who vacates claiming a constructive eviction takes a real chance. On the one hand, the tenant must give the landlord notice of the defect and time to resolve the problem. If she leaves too soon, she cannot later successfully assert constructive eviction as an affirmative defense in an action by the landlord for unpaid rent. On the other hand, the covenant of quiet enjoyment is waivable, and if the tenant waits too long before vacating the premises, she will be considered to have waived any constructive eviction claim. Why do you suppose MCPO waited so long before finally moving out of its office? Was it reasonable under the circumstances for it to do so?</p>
<p id="e12105d9-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">May the covenant of quiet enjoyment be breached if the tenant remains in possession (i.e., absent a constructive eviction)? The answer should be yes. Judicial decisions sometimes say that an eviction, actual or constructive, is necessary to constitute a <i>breach</i> of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, but they are incorrect. The covenant of quiet enjoyment and constructive eviction, although related, are distinct doctrines. Constructive eviction is a remedy for a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, but it is not the only available remedy. So, the tenant should be, and usually is, able to stay in possession and sue for damages equal to the difference between the value of the property with and without the breach. See Echo Consulting Services, Inc. v. North Conway Bank, 669 A.2d 227 (N.H. 1995) (if breach is not so substantial as to work a constructive eviction, tenant may stay in possession and sue for compensatory damages); Stevan v. Brown, 458 A.2d 466 (Md. App. 1983) (same).</p>
<p id="e1212cea-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Partial eviction—actual and constructive.</i></b> If there is an <i>actual eviction</i>, even though from a <i>part</i> of the premises only, the tenant is relieved of <i>all</i> liability for rent notwithstanding continued occupation of the balance. The rationale is that the landlord may not apportion his wrong. (Restatement (Second) of Property, Landlord and Tenant §6.1 (1977) rejects this rule and provides that the tenant may receive an abatement in the rent but may not withhold all rent.) Is a tenant relieved of the obligation to pay rent when there is not an actual, but rather a <i>constructive</i>, partial eviction—say when some breach by the landlord makes only a part, but not all, of the premises uninhabitable—even though the tenant remains in undisturbed possession of the balance? In most jurisdictions the answer is no. See, e.g., Brine v. Bergstrom, 480 P.2d 783 (Wash. App. 1971). The lower courts in New York have gone back and forth on the question. See Minjak Co. v. Randolph, 528 N.Y.S.2d 554 (Sup. Ct. 1988) (accepting theory); Zweighaft v. Remington, 66 Misc. 2d 261, (Civ. Ct. 1971) (rejecting theory); East Haven Assocs., Inc. v. Gurian, 64 Misc. 2d 276 (Civ.

<p id="e1212cf5-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The early common law was hardheaded, and hardhearted, about a tenant’s rights and remedies. Absent some clause in the lease providing otherwise, the tenant took the premises “as is,” and landlords were under no obligation to warrant their fitness. Apart from the few narrow exceptions that we briefly considered on page 331 in connection with the covenant of quiet enjoyment, there was no implied warranty of habitability. Tenants had to protect themselves. <i>Caveat lessee</i>—let the lessee beware!</p>
<p id="e1212cf6-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given the culture in which the early common law rules developed, perhaps they made some sense. In any event, as society and culture changed, largely in the direction of urbanization and specialization, so too did the common law—but begrudgingly, usually in the language of exceptions and qualifications rather than the bold rhetoric of reform, and often with statutory prodding. The process of change began well over a century ago and led to the development of a body of conventional doctrine that was, for a long time, very stable. But with the 1960s there began a period of sweeping reform—most of it at first concerned with residential tenancies, much of it initiated by courts rather than legislatures—the implications and merits of which are still matters of dispute. The reforms have not so much replaced conventional doctrine as riddled it. A given jurisdiction might adopt one new reform but not another, or limit what it adopts to residential tenancies. A useful understanding of this area of landlord-tenant relations thus still requires some attention to the older rules as well as the newer ones.</p>

Defendants appeal from a judgment rendered by the Rutland Superior Court. The court ordered defendants to pay plaintiff damages in the amount of $4,945.00, which represented “reimbursement of all rent paid and additional compensatory damages” for the rental of a residential apartment over a fourteen month period in defendants’ Rutland apartment building. Defendants filed a motion for reconsideration on the issue of the amount of damages awarded to the plaintiff, and plaintiff filed a cross-motion for reconsideration of the court’s denial of an award of punitive damages. The court denied both motions. On appeal, defendants raise three issues for our consideration: first, whether the court correctly calculated the amount of damages awarded the plaintiff; secondly, whether the court’s award to plaintiff of the entire amount of rent paid to defendants was proper since the plaintiff remained in possession of the apartment for the entire fourteen month period; and finally, whether the court’s finding that defendant Stuart St. Peter acted on his own behalf and with the apparent authority of defendant Patricia St. Peter was error.</p>
<p id="e121540d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The facts are uncontested. In October, 1974, plaintiff began occupying an apartment at defendants’ 10-12 Church Street apartment building in Rutland with her three children and new-born grandson.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10D6E_5eaa12e0-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10D6E_5eaa12e0-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">8</a></span> Plaintiff orally agreed to pay defendant Stuart St. Peter $140 a month and a damage deposit of $50; plaintiff paid defendant the first month’s rent and the damage deposit prior to moving in. Plaintiff has paid all rent due under her tenancy. Because the previous tenants had left behind garbage and items of personal belongings, defendant offered to refund plaintiff’s damage deposit if she would clean the apartment herself prior to taking possession. Plaintiff did clean the apartment, but never received her deposit back because the defendant denied ever receiving it. Upon moving into the apartment, plaintiff discovered a broken kitchen window. Defendant promised to repair it, but after waiting a week and fearing that her two year old child might cut herself on the shards of glass, plaintiff repaired the window at her own expense. Although defendant promised to provide a front door key, he never did. For a period of time, whenever plaintiff left the apartment, a member of her family would remain behind for security reasons. Eventually, plaintiff purchased and installed a padlock, again at her own expense. After moving in, plaintiff discovered that the bathroom toilet was clogged with paper and feces and would flush only by dumping pails of water into it. Although plaintiff repeatedly complained about the toilet, and defendant promised to have it repaired, the toilet remained clogged and mechanically inoperable throughout the period of plaintiff’s tenancy. In addition, the bathroom light and wall outlet were inoperable. Again, the defendant agreed to repair the fixtures, but never did. In order to have light in the bathroom, plaintiff attached a fixture to the wall and connected it to an extension cord that was plugged into an adjoining room. Plaintiff also discovered that water leaked from the water pipes of the upstairs apartment down the ceilings and walls of both her kitchen and back bedroom. Again, defendant promised to fix the leakage, but never did. As a result of this leakage, a large section of <span title="336" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-336">p. 336</span>plaster fell from the back bedroom ceiling onto her bed and her grandson’s crib. Other sections of plaster remained dangling from the ceiling. This condition was brought to the attention of the defendant, but he never corrected it. Fearing that the remaining plaster might fall when the room was occupied, plaintiff moved her and her grandson’s bedroom furniture into the living room and ceased using the back bedroom. During the summer months an odor of raw sewage permeated plaintiff’s apartment. The odor was so strong that the plaintiff was ashamed to have company in her apartment. Responding to plaintiff’s complaints, Rutland City workers unearthed a broken sewage pipe in the basement of defendants’ building. Raw sewage littered the floor of the basement, but defendant failed to clean it up. Plaintiff also discovered that the electric service for her furnace was attached to her breaker box, although defendant had agreed, at the commencement of plaintiff’s tenancy, to furnish heat.</p>
<p id="e121540f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In its conclusions of law, the court held that the state of disrepair of plaintiff’s apartment, which was known to the defendants, substantially reduced the value of the leasehold from the agreed rental value, thus constituting a breach of the implied warranty of habitability. The court based its award of damages on the breach of this warranty and on breach of an express contract. Defendant argues that the court misapplied the law of Vermont relating to habitability because the plaintiff never abandoned the demised premises and, therefore, it was error to award her the full amount of rent paid. Plaintiff counters that, while never expressly recognized by this Court, the trial court was correct in applying an implied warranty of habitability and that under this warranty, abandonment of the premises is not required. Plaintiff urges this Court to affirmatively adopt the implied warranty of habitability.</p>
<p id="e1215410-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Historically, relations between landlords and tenants have been defined by the law of property. Under these traditional common law property concepts, a lease was viewed as a conveyance of real property. See Note, Judicial Expansion of Tenants’ Private Law Rights: Implied Warranties of Habitability and Safety in Residential Urban Leases, 56 Cornell L.Q. 489, 489-90 (1971) (hereinafter cited as Expansion of Tenants’ Rights). The relationship between landlord and tenant was controlled by the doctrine of caveat lessee; that is, the tenant took possession of the demised premises irrespective of their state of disrepair. Love, Landlord’s Liability for Defective Premises: Caveat Lessee, Negligence, or Strict Liability?, 1975 Wis. L. Rev. 19, 27-28. The landlord’s only covenant was to deliver possession to the tenant. The tenant’s obligation to pay rent existed independently of the landlord’s duty to deliver possession, so that as long as possession remained in the tenant, the tenant remained liable for payment of rent. The landlord was under no duty to render the premises habitable unless there was an express covenant to repair in the written lease. Expansion of Tenants’ Rights, supra, at 490. The land, not the dwelling, was regarded as the essence of the conveyance.</p>
<p id="e1215411-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An exception to the rule of caveat lessee was the doctrine of constructive eviction. Lemle v. Breeden, 51 Haw. 426, 430, 462 P.2d 470, 473 (1969). Here, if the landlord wrongfully interfered with the tenant’s enjoyment of the demised premises, or failed to render a duty to the tenant as expressly required under the terms of the lease, the tenant could abandon the premises and cease paying rent.</p>
<p id="e1215412-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Beginning in the 1960’s, American courts began recognizing that this approach to landlord and tenant relations, which had originated during the Middle Ages, had become an anachronism in twentieth century, urban society. Today’s tenant enters into lease agreements, not to obtain arable land, but to obtain safe, sanitary and comfortable housing.</p>

The landlord is more familiar with the dwelling unit and mechanical equipment attached to that unit, and is more financially able to “discover and cure” any faults and break-downs. Confronted with a recognized shortage of safe, decent housing, today’s tenant is in an inferior bargaining position compared to that of the landlord. Park West Management Corp. v.

Additionally, the implied warranty of habitability covers all latent and patent defects in the essential facilities of the residential unit.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10DB5_5eaa12e0-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10DB5_5eaa12e0-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">9</a></span> Essential facilities are “facilities vital to the use of the premises for residential purposes. . . .” Kline v. Burns, 111 N.H. 87, 92, 276 A.2d 248, 252 (1971). This means that a tenant who enters into a lease agreement with knowledge of any defect in the essential facilities cannot be said to have assumed the risk, thereby losing the protection of the warranty. Nor can this implied warranty of habitability be waived by any written provision in the lease or by oral agreement.</p>
<p id="e1217b2c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In determining whether there has been a breach of the implied warranty of habitability, the courts may first look to any relevant local or municipal housing code; they may also make reference to the minimum housing code standards enunciated in 24 V.S.A. §§5003(c)(1)-5003(c)(5). A substantial violation of an applicable housing code shall constitute prima facie evidence that there has been a breach of the warranty of habitability. “[O]ne or two minor violations standing alone which do not affect” the health or safety of the tenant, shall be considered de minimis and not a breach of the warranty.

See A Dream Deferred, supra, at 248-50. Whether a portion, all or none of the rent will be awarded to the landlord will depend on the findings relative to the extent and duration of the breach.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10DE6_5eaa12e0-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10DE6_5eaa12e0-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">11</a></span> Javins v.

<p id="e121a247-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to general damages, we hold that punitive damages may be available to a tenant in the appropriate case. Although punitive damages are generally not recoverable in actions for breach of contract, there are cases in which the breach is of such a willful and wanton or fraudulent nature as to make appropriate the award of exemplary damages. A willful and wanton or fraudulent breach may be shown “by conduct manifesting personal ill will, or carried out under circumstances of insult or oppression, or even by conduct manifesting . . . a reckless or wanton disregard of [one’s] rights. . . .” Sparrow v. Vermont Savings Bank, 95 Vt. 29, 33, 112 A. 205, 207 <span title="340" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-340">p. 340</span>(1921). When a landlord, after receiving notice of a defect, fails to repair the facility that is essential to the health and safety of his or her tenant, an award of punitive damages is proper. 111 East 88th Partners v. Simon, 106 Misc. 2d 693, 434 N.Y.S.2d 886, 889 (N.Y. Civ. Ct. 1980). . . . </p>

Because of our holding in this case, the doctrine of constructive eviction, wherein the tenant must abandon in order to escape liability for rent, is no longer viable. When, as in the instant case, the tenant seeks, not to escape rent liability, but to receive compensatory damages in the amount of rent already paid, abandonment is similarly unnecessary. Under our holding, when a landlord breaches the implied warranty of habitability, the tenant may withhold future rent, and may also seek damages in the amount of rent previously paid.</p>
<p id="e121a249-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In its conclusions of law the trial court stated that the defendants’ failure to make repairs was compensable by damages to the extent of reimbursement of all rent paid and additional compensatory damages. The court awarded plaintiff a total of $4,945.00; $3,445.00 represents the entire amount of rent plaintiff paid, plus the $50.00 deposit. This appears to leave $1,500.00 as the “additional compensatory damages.” However, although the court made findings which clearly demonstrate the appropriateness of an award of compensatory damages, there is no indication as to how the court reached a figure of $1,500.00. It is “crucial that this Court and the parties be able to determine what was decided and how the decision was reached.” Fox v. McLain, 142 Vt. 11, 16, 451 A.2d 1122, 1124 (1982).</p>
<p id="e121a24a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Additionally, the court denied an award to plaintiff of punitive damages on the ground that the evidence failed to support a finding of willful and wanton or fraudulent conduct. The facts in this case, which defendants do not contest, evince a pattern of intentional conduct on the part of defendants for which the term “slumlord” surely was coined. Defendants’ conduct was culpable and demeaning to plaintiff and clearly expressive of a wanton disregard of plaintiff’s rights. The trial court found that defendants were aware of defects in the essential facilities of plaintiff’s apartment, promised plaintiff that repairs would be made, but never fulfilled those promises. The court also found that plaintiff continued, throughout her tenancy, to pay her rent, often in the face of verbal threats made by defendant Stuart St. Peter. These findings point to the “bad spirit and wrong intention” of the defendants, Glidden v. Skinner, 142 Vt. 644, 648, 458 A.2d 1142, 1144 (1983), and would support a finding of willful and wanton or fraudulent conduct, contrary to the conclusions of law and judgment of the trial judge. However, the plaintiff did not appeal the court’s denial of punitive damages, and issues not appealed and briefed are waived.</p>
<p id="e121a24b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We find that defendants’ third claimed error, that the court erred in finding that both defendant Stuart St. Peter and defendant Patricia St. Peter were liable to plaintiff for the breach of the implied warranty of habitability, is meritless. Both defendants were named in the complaint as owners of the 10-12 Church Street apartment building. Plaintiff’s complaint also alleged that defendant Stuart St. Peter acted as agent for defendant Patricia St. Peter. Defendants failed to deny these allegations; under V.R.C.P. 8(d) these averments stand as admitted.</p>

<p id="e121a250-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Status of the implied warranty of habitability.</i></b> By latest count, the warranty of habitability has been adopted for residential leases in all but three jurisdictions (Alabama, Arkansas, and Wyoming). See 1 Milton R. Friedman, Friedman on Leases App. 10A (Patrick A. Randolph, Jr. ed. &amp; rev. 5th ed. 2005). In most states, adoption has been effected through legislation rather than judicial reform, as in <i>Hilder</i>. A majority of jurisdictions have declined to extend the idea to an implied warranty of fitness or suitability for purpose in commercial leases. Even in the residential context, however, the warranty usually does not apply to all leases. Single family residences might be excluded, for example; or agricultural leases, or long-term leases. So too for casual leases by non-merchant landlords, as when a law professor goes off on sabbatical and rents her house to a visitor. See, e.g., Zimmerman v. Moore, 441 N.E.2d 690 (Ind. App. 1982) (single-family home rented by non-merchant landlord). The upshot is that the implied warranty of habitability does <i>not</i> render pointless the doctrines of quiet enjoyment, constructive eviction, and illegal leases considered earlier.</p>
<p id="e121c961-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Standard and breach of the warranty.</i></b> The standard of the implied warranty of habitability, and the shortcomings that amount to breaches of the standard, appear to vary among jurisdictions, but the differences are probably more nominal than real when it comes to actual cases. Generally speaking, an “adequate standard of habitability” has to be met, and a breach occurs when the leased premises are “uninhabitable” in the eyes of a reasonable person. Housing code provisions and their violation are compelling but usually not conclusive.</p>
<p id="e121c962-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In short, the objective is safe and healthy housing; substantial compliance is required. But this means something more than merely avoiding slum conditions. For example, continued loud noise in an apartment building might be a breach. See, e.g., Millbridge Apts. v. Linden, 376 A.2d 611 (N.J. Dist. Ct. 1977). So too for failure of a central air conditioning system. See, e.g., Park Hill Terrace Assocs. v. Glennon, 369 A.2d 938 (N.J. App. Div. 1977). So too for bedbugs. See, e.g., Ludlow Properties, LLC v. Young, 780 N.Y.S.2d 853 (N.Y. City Civ. Ct. 2004). And second-hand smoke. See, e.g., Poyck v. Bryant, 820 N.Y.S.2d 774 (N.Y. City Civ. Ct. 2006).</p>
<p id="e121c963-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Mandatory or default rule?</i></b> Most jurisdictions agree with <i>Hilder</i> that the implied warranty of habitability cannot be waived, but a few might permit a “knowing” waiver by the tenant if “bargaining power” is essentially “equal.” See Restatement (Second) of Property, Landlord and Tenant §5.6 (1977). Consistent with this, most jurisdictions apply the warranty even to patent defects, though a few appear to exclude them at least so long as they do not violate housing code provisions. Why might it be that the warranty of habitability is typically a mandatory rule, rather than a default rule?</p>
<p id="e121c964-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Remedies for breach.</i></b> The implied warranty of habitability is based largely on contractual principles, and a number of cases agree with <i>Hilder</i> that in the case of breach a tenant may avail himself of all the basic contract remedies—damages, rescission, and reformation. There are some unique aspects of the tenant’s remedies, however. In general, the following remedies are available to the tenant: (1) remain in possession and bring an action for damages for breach of the warranty (as in <i>Hilder</i>); (2) rescind the lease, thereby permitting the tenant to vacate the premises with no further obligation to pay rent; (3) remain in possession and <span title="342" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-342">p. 342</span>withhold all or part of the rent (most jurisdictions allow the tenant to withhold all of the rent, even for a partial breach of the warranty; some require the tenant to deposit withheld rent in a separate escrow account until the dispute is finally resolved); and (4) repair the defects and deduct the costs of the repairs from rent payments. There is considerable disagreement about how to calculate the rent reduction or damages. Courts have used three different formulae:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="e121c965-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">→ 1. <i>Agreed rent—fair market rental value (FMRV) of premises in defective condition</i></p>
</div>
<p id="e121c966-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is the most straightforward formula because it uses the agreed rent as the starting point. In <i>Hilder</i>, however, the court used a different verbal formula: “the difference between the value of the dwelling as warranted and the value of the dwelling as it exists in its defective condition.” So,</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="e121c967-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">→ 2. <i>FMRV of premises in compliant conditions—FMRV of premises in defective condition</i></p>
</div>
<p id="e121c968-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why did the court use this formula, given the fact that the premises obviously were not in compliance with the warranty at the inception of the lease (notice, by the way, that the court said that the tenant may use the agreed rent as evidence to establish “fair rental value as warranted”)? The obvious problem is that formula 1 may lead to zero damages because if the defects existed at the inception of the lease, and if the tenant was aware of them (as in <i>Hilder</i>), the agreed rent will tend to equal the value of the premises in their actual (i.e., noncompliant) condition. This would provide an indirect means of allowing the parties to waive a term that is presumably non-waivable. The aim of formula 2 is to avoid that possibility. Does this formula strike you as fair to both parties, or does it provide a windfall to the tenant?</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="e121c969-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">→ 3. <i>Agreed rent—% of rent corresponding to lease value lost as a consequence of the landlord’s breach</i></p>
</div>
<p id="e121c96a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Example: L</i> charges <i>T</i> $600 per month for an apartment. The fair rental value of the premises in habitable conditions (under the warranty of habitability) is $1,000 per month. The fair rental value of the premises in this existing, non-complying condition is $500 per month. The percentage of value lost is 50%. Hence, the tenant is entitled to reduce the rent by $300 a month to $300 a month.</p>
<p id="e121c96b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. <i>The consequences of the warranty of habitability.</i></b> The warranty of habitability is certainly not without its critics. The most common criticism is that, contrary to the expectations of its supporters, the warranty does not improve the welfare of low-income tenants. Most of the work on the consequences of the warranty has been theoretical, but some empirical work has been done. An article on several studies of landlord-tenant courts summarized several findings, among which are the following:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="e121c96c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The new doctrinal regime did not increase the number of eviction cases filed, indicating perhaps that there has not been an increase in tenant rent withholding.</p></li>
<li><p id="e121c96d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A very large percentage of eviction cases never reach open court. Landlord-tenant courts have high default rates. Apparently, once landlords get either the rent or possession, they drop the proceeding. Tenants apparently prefer to move rather than litigate.</p></li>

<p id="e121f07e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of the small minority that do reach court, the vast majority are resolved with no reference to the condition of the premises. Tenants are seldom represented by counsel, tenants themselves appear to lack sufficient knowledge of the law to assert their rights under it. See David A.

<p id="e121f085-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The illegal lease and retaliatory eviction doctrines</i>. Along with the implied warranty of habitability, courts developed two cognate doctrines. The first is the <i>illegal lease</i> doctrine. This doctrine provides that a lease for premises that are subject to housing code violations that create unsafe or unsanitary conditions is illegal and therefore unenforceable. The upshot is that the landlord may not enforce provisions in the lease, including the covenant to pay rent. From the tenant’s point of view, the chief attraction of the illegal lease defense was the leverage it provided: <span title="344" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-344">p. 344</span>unlike a claim based on quiet enjoyment and constructive eviction, the tenant could withhold rent and still stave off the landlord’s inevitable action to evict for nonpayment. The doctrine is a dead letter today, however, because it has been replaced by the warranty of habitability.</p>
<p id="e121f086-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second cognate doctrine—retaliatory eviction—is much more important. In a nutshell, this doctrine provides that a landlord cannot retaliate against a tenant for reporting housing code violations. Conventional common law doctrine gave landlords virtually unlimited freedom to terminate periodic tenancies and tenancies at will upon proper notice and to refuse to renew expired terms of years. The landlord’s reasons were irrelevant and could be malevolent. This feature of the common law could easily undermine the warranty of habitability simply by getting rid of tenants who complained of a breach of the warranty. To avoid this result, most jurisdictions today, whether by statute or judicial decision, forbid retaliatory action by landlords. A fairly common approach is to create a rebuttable presumption of retaliatory purpose if the landlord seeks to terminate a tenancy, increase rent, or decrease services within some given period (commonly anywhere from 90 to 180 days) after a good-faith complaint or other action by a tenant based on the condition of the premises. Retaliatory acts beyond the stated period are also usually prohibited, but the tenant bears the burden of proof.</p>

<p id="e1221799-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On January 1, 2011, Owen rented a small apartment to Alysha under a written 5-year lease for $1,000/month. The lease provided that the lessee could not assign or sublease without the lessor’s express consent and that failure to obtain consent rendered the lease voidable at the lessor’s option. It imposed no requirement that the lessor act reasonably. A little more than a year later, in February 2012, Alysha’s employer relocated her to a different city. Alysha found someone, Britney, who was willing to take over her lease for the duration of its term. Alysha asked Owen to consent to her assigning her lease to Britney for the balance of the terms, on the same terms and conditions as the head lease. Britney had a good job and an excellent credit report, but Owen refused, simply saying that he “disliked turnover.” Alysha went ahead anyway and assigned the lease to Britney.</p>
<p id="e122179a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Britney took possession of the apartment on March 1, 2012. Everything went smoothly for the first three months. She mailed monthly checks to Owen on the first of each month to pay the rent of $1,000, and Owen cashed each check. On May 25, the toilet and both the bathroom and kitchen sinks in the apartment backed up and became unusable. These were the only toilets and sinks in the apartment, and Britney was desperate for help. She contacted Owen immediately and asked him to fix the problems. Owen’s only response was, “I’ll see what I can do.” Britney waited five days, but no one showed up. In the meantime she used a neighbor’s apartment for her bathroom needs. By June 1, Britney had had enough. She stopped paying rent and sent Owen a letter stating that she intended to remain in possession but no longer pay rent until he properly repaired the toilet and sink problems. Owen’s response was to bring an action against Alysha to terminate the head lease and another action against Britney to recover possession for failure to pay rent. What arguments do Alysha and Britney have in defense? How strong are these arguments?</p>

<p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e11f5872-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f">Item #5 The Lessee will make no changes to the building structure without first receiving written authorization from the Lessor.

<p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e11f5873-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f">Item #6 The Lessee agrees to operate the restaurant in a lawful and prudent manner during the lease period.</p>

If the tenant defaulted, the lease gave the landlord the option of re-entering or re-letting, but stipulated that failure to re-let or to recover the full rental would not discharge the tenant’s liability for rent.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e11ff3f7-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN109E5_5eaa12e0-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" id="note-N109E5_5eaa12e0-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">6</a></span>&nbsp;It is well settled that a party claiming damages for a breach of contract has a duty to mitigate his loss . . . . </p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e1201b09-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN109EF_5eaa12e0-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" id="note-N109EF_5eaa12e0-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">7</a></span>&nbsp;We see no distinction between the leases involved in the instant appeals and those which might arise in other types of residential housing.

See, e.g., Javins v. First National Realty Corp., supra, 428 F.2d at 1083 n.67; see also King v. Moorehead, supra, 495 S.W.2d at 77 (<i>King</i> requires the deposit of the rent into legal custody pending the litigation). Such a procedure assures the availability of that portion, if any, of the rent which the court determines is due to the landlord. King v. Moorehead, supra, 495 S.W.2d at 77; see A Dream Deferred, supra, at 248-250.</p></div>

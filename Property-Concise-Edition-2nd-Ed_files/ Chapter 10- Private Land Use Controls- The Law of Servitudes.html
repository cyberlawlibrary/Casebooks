<p id="e14110dc-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this chapter we study land use arrangements arising out of private agreements. Usually, but not always, the agreements involve two or more parcels of land, and the purpose of the agreements is to increase the total value of all the parcels involved. And usually, but not always, the effect of the agreements is to burden one parcel of land for the benefit of another parcel. For example, the owner of Tract 1 may have an easement to cross Tract 2 to reach a public road. Burdens and benefits are often reciprocal, as when all lots in a subdivision are restricted to residential use. These agreements create interests in land, binding and benefiting not only the parties to the agreement in question but also their successors. These interests are commonly called, as a class, <i>servitudes</i>.</p>

<p id="e14137ef-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Students, not to mention law professors and practicing lawyers, often find the law of servitudes complex and confusing. Servitude law’s complexity stems largely from the fact that the same functional interest may be classified under different doctrinal labels, each with its own set of requirements. Traditional servitude doctrine classifies private use interests into four categories: easements, covenants, profits à prendre (or “profits” for short), and licenses. By far, the most important are the first two, easement and covenants. Covenants are further divided into another dichotomy: covenants enforceable at law (called “real covenants”) and covenants enforceable in equity (“equitable servitudes”).</p>

Is a unified and internally consistent law of servitudes possible? As we shall see, the Restatement (Third) of Property, Servitudes, which the American Law Institute adopted in 2000, has gone considerably down that road. We will study both the traditional doctrines of servitude law as well as the new Servitude rules, because although the Restatement will likely influence <span title="485" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-485">p. 485</span>the future development of Restatement law, for the time being many courts continue to rely on the traditional rules.</p>

<p id="e1415f15-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The primary modern forms of servitudes—easements, real covenants, and equitable servitudes—are largely products of the nineteenth century. In the days of common fields, there was little need for defining rights of way; people wandered where they wished through the unfenced countryside, causing little injury. But the English enclosure movement, which began in the sixteenth century and terminated common use rights, together with the Industrial Revolution, created the need for a new, systematic body of law dealing with easements of way as well as other servitudes regulating interdependent land uses.</p>
<p id="e1415f16-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the nineteenth century, a general law of easements developed, replacing the hodgepodge of specific interests that courts recognized with nothing organizing them. The courts gradually classified easements in two different ways, along two vectors, if you will. The first vector concerns whether the easement is <i>affirmative</i> (or positive) or <i>negative</i> (i.e., restrictive) in character. The vast majority of easements are affirmative; that is, they give the interest holder a right to do an affirmative act on land that someone else owns. The early law also recognized a few types of negative easements—easements forbidding one landowner from doing something on his land that might harm a neighbor. But the courts were chary of creating new negative easements, for reasons we will discuss later, at pages 533-534, and strictly fenced them in.</p>
<p id="e1415f17-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to the distinction between affirmative and negative easement, easements are also classified as <i>appurtenant</i> or <i>in gross</i>. Both types of easements give easement owners the right to make some specific use (or in the case of a negative easement, restrict some particular use) of land that they do not own. An easement appurtenant gives that right to whomever owns a parcel of land that the easement benefits. An easement in gross gives the right to some person without regard to ownership of land. Stated somewhat differently, an easement appurtenant benefits the easement owner in the use of land belonging to that owner, but an easement in gross benefits the easement owner personally rather than in connection with use of land that the person owns. If it is unclear which type of easement is intended by the parties, the law construes in favor of an easement appurtenant. For example, in a case where the sellers reserved an easement “for the watering of livestock owned by the sellers,” the court held that the easement was appurtenant to the neighboring tract the sellers owned. Nelson v. Johnson, 679 P.2d 662 (Idaho 1984). See Restatement (Third) of Property, Servitudes §4.5 (2000).</p>

<p id="e141ad41-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Easements appurtenant require both a <i>dominant tenement</i> (or estate) and a <i>servient tenement</i>. The easement attaches to and benefits the dominant tenement. Appurtenant easements are usually transferable. The easement transfers along with the dominant tenement to successive owners. However, appurtenant easement can be made personal to the easement owner only and not transferable to others.</p>
<p id="e141ad42-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because an easement in gross does not benefit any land, it involves no dominant estate, only a servient estate. Easements in gross may be alienable or inalienable. Easements in gross are sometimes said to be “personal,” but they are personal only in the sense that they do not attach to any parcel of land owned by the easement owner, not in the sense that they may not be transferred to another person.</p>
<p id="e141ad43-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Assignability of easement in gross.</i> The transferability of easements in gross raises special problems. The benefits and burdens of appurtenant easements pass automatically to assignees of the land to which they are appurtenant, if the parties so intend and the burdened party has notice of the easement. Where the benefit is in gross, however, the benefit may not be assignable. The first Restatement of Property §489 (1944) provided that an easement in gross can be assigned if of a commercial character (used primarily for economic benefit rather than personal satisfaction). Restatement (Third) of Property, Servitudes §§4.6(1)(c), 5.8 (2000), provides that all easements in gross are assignable regardless of their commercial character. Most recent cases permit any easement in gross to be assignable if the parties so intended. See O’Donovan v. McIntosh, 728 A.2d 681 (Me. 1999).</p>

<p id="e141fb72-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Assignability leads to a second question about easements in gross: may the benefit holder divide the benefit with another person? The general view is that an easement in gross is divisible when the creating instrument so indicates or when the easement is exclusive. The term “exclusive” in this context means that the easement owner has the sole right to engage in the activity that the easement permits.</p>
<p id="e141fb73-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Excessive division of the benefit of an easement in gross could lead to a substantial increase in the burden on the servient estate. Restatement (Third) of Property, supra, §5.9, provides that easements in gross may be divided unless contrary to the intent of the parties creating the easement or unless the division unreasonably increases the burden on the servient estate. Accord, Orange County v. Citgo Pipeline Co., 934 S.W.2d 472 (Tex. Civ. App. 1996). On this view, the benefit of an easement in gross may be divided and utilized independently by its holders, assuming that this is not contrary to the intent of the original parties and that division would not place an unreasonable burden on the servient estate. However, the Restatement points out that division of benefits in gross are more likely than subdivision of appurtenant benefits to run counter to the servient owner’s expectations because division permits independent use of the easement in gross by each of the transferees. Restatement (Third) of Property, supra, §5.9 comment a. Under the Restatement’s approach, the exclusivity or non-exclusivity of the easement is still relevant. “Division of an exclusive easement is less likely to be contrary to the intent of the parties than division of a non-exclusive easement.” Id.</p>

<p id="e141fb7d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs Donald E. and Jennie C. Willard filed an action to quiet title to a lot in Pacifica against the First Church of Christ, Scientist (the church). After a trial, judgment was entered quieting the Willards’ title. The church has appealed.</p>
<p id="e141fb7e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Genevieve McGuigan owned two abutting lots in Pacifica known as lots 19 and 20. There was a building on lot 19, and lot 20 was vacant. McGuigan was a member of the church, which was located across the street from her lots, and she permitted it to use lot 20 for parking during services. She sold lot 19 to one Petersen, who used the building as an office. He wanted to resell the lot, so he listed it with Willard, who is a realtor. Willard expressed an interest in purchasing both lots 19 and 20, and he and Petersen signed a deposit receipt for the sale of the two lots. Soon thereafter they entered into an escrow, into which Petersen delivered a deed for both lots in fee simple.</p>
<p id="e142228f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the time he agreed to sell lot 20 to Willard, Petersen did not own it, so he approached McGuigan with an offer to purchase it. She was willing to sell the lot provided the church could continue to use it for parking. She therefore referred the matter to the church’s attorney, who drew up a provision for the deed that stated the conveyance was “subject to an easement for automobile parking during church hours for the benefit of the church on the property at the southwest corner of the intersection of Hilton Way and Francisco Boulevard…such easement to run with the land only so long as the property for whose benefit the easement is given is used for church purposes.” Once this clause was inserted in the deed, McGuigan sold the property to Petersen, and he recorded the deed.</p>
<p id="e1422290-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Willard paid the agreed purchase price into the escrow and received Petersen’s deed 10 days later. He then recorded this deed, which did not mention an easement for parking by the church. While Petersen did mention to Willard that the church would want to use lot 20 for parking, it does not appear that he told him of the easement clause contained in the deed he received from McGuigan.</p>
<p id="e1422291-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Willard became aware of the easement clause several months after purchasing the property. He then commenced this action to quiet title against the church. At the trial, which was without a jury, McGuigan testified that she had bought lot 20 to provide parking for the church, and would not have sold it unless she was assured the church could thereafter continue to use it for parking. The court found that McGuigan and Petersen intended to convey an easement to the church, but that the clause they employed was ineffective for that purpose because it was invalidated by the common law rule that one cannot “reserve” an interest in property to a stranger to the title.</p>

<p id="e1422295-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rule derives from the common law notions of reservations from a grant and was based on feudal considerations. A reservation allows a grantor’s whole interest in the property to pass to the grantee, but revests a newly created interest in the grantor.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10251_5eaa6106-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10251_5eaa6106-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">1</a></span> (4 Tiffany, The Law of Real Property (3d ed. 1939) §972.) While a reservation could theoretically vest an interest in a third party, the early common law courts vigorously rejected this possibility, apparently because they mistrusted and wished to limit conveyance by deed as a substitute for livery by seisin.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1025A_5eaa6106-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1025A_5eaa6106-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">2</a></span> (See Harris, Reservations in Favor of Strangers to the Title (1953) 6 Okla. L. Rev. 127, 132-133.) Insofar as this mistrust was the foundation of the rule, it is clearly an inapposite feudal shackle today. <span title="489" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-489">p. 489</span>Consequently, several commentators have attacked the rule as groundless and have called for its abolition. (See, e.g., Harris, supra, 6 Okla. L. Rev. at p. 154; Meyers &amp; Williams, Oil and Gas Conveyancing; Grants and Reservations by Owners of Fractional Mineral Interests (1957) 43 Va. L. Rev. 639, 650-651; Comment, Real Property: Easements: Creation by Reservation or Exception (1948) 36 Cal. L. Rev. 470, 476; Annot., Reservation or exception in deed in favor of stranger, 88 A.L.R.2d 1199, 1202; cf. 4 Tiffany, supra, §974, at p. 54; 2 American Law of Property (Casner ed. 1952) §8.29, at p. 254.)</p>
<p id="e1422298-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">California early adhered to this common law rule. (Eldridge v. See Yup Company (1860) 17 Cal. 44.) In considering our continued adherence to it, we must realize that our courts no longer feel constricted by feudal forms of conveyancing. Rather, our primary objective in construing a conveyance is to try to give effect to the intent of the grantor.…In general, therefore, grants are to be interpreted in the same way as other contracts and not according to rigid feudal standards.…The common law rule conflicts with the modern approach to construing deeds because it can frustrate the grantor’s intent. Moreover, it produces an inequitable result because the original grantee has presumably paid a reduced price for title to the encumbered property. In this case, for example, McGuigan testified that she had discounted the price she charged Petersen by about one-third because of the easement.…</p>
<p id="e1422299-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In view of the obvious defects of the rule, this court has found methods to avoid it where applying it would frustrate the clear intention of the grantor. In Butler v. Gosling (1900) 130 Cal. 422 [62 P. 596], the court prevented the reserved title to a portion of the property from vesting in the grantee by treating the reservation as an exception to the grant. In Boyer v. Murphy (1927) 202 Cal. 23 [259 P. 38], the court, noting that its primary objective was to give effect to the grantor’s intention (id., at pp. 28-29), held that the rule was inapplicable where the third party was the grantor’s spouse. (See Fleming v. State Bar (1952) 38 Cal. 2d 341, 345, fn. 2 [239 P.2d 866.]) Similarly, the…courts of other states<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1026D_5eaa6106-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1026D_5eaa6106-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">3</a></span> have found ways of circumventing the rule.</p>
<p id="e142229b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The highest courts of two states have already eliminated the rule altogether, rather than repealing it piecemeal by evasion. In Townsend v. Cable (Ky. 1964) 378 S.W.2d <span title="490" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-490">p. 490</span>806, the Court of Appeals of Kentucky abandoned the rule. It said: “We have no hesitancy in abandoning this archaic and technical rule. It is entirely inconsistent with the basic principle followed in the construction of deeds, which is to determine the intention of grantor as gathered from the four corners of the instrument.” (Id., at p. 808.) (See also Blair v. City of Pikeville (Ky. 1964) 384 S.W.2d 65, 66; Combs v. Hounshell (Ky. 1961) 347 S.W.2d 550, 554.) Relying on <i>Townsend</i>, the Supreme Court of Oregon, in Garza v. Grayson (1970) 255 Ore. 413 [467 P.2d 960], rejected the rule because it was “derived from a narrow and highly technical interpretation of the meaning of the terms ‘reservation’ and ‘exception’ when employed in a deed” (id., at p. 961), and did not sufficiently justify frustrating the grantor’s intention in some cases even though it is riddled with exceptions, we follow the lead of Kentucky and Oregon and abandon it entirely.</p>
<p id="e14249ac-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Willard contends that the old rule should nevertheless be applied in this case to invalidate the church’s easement because grantees and title insurers have relied upon it. He has not, however, presented any evidence to support this contention, and it is clear that the facts of this case do not demonstrate reliance on the old rule. There is no evidence that a policy of title insurance was issued, and therefore no showing of reliance by a title insurance company. Willard himself could not have relied upon the common law rule to assure him of an absolute fee because he did not even read the deed containing the reservation. This is not a case of an ancient deed where the reservation has not been asserted for many years. The church used lot 20 for parking throughout the period when Willard was purchasing the property and after he acquired title to it, and he may not claim that he was prejudiced by lack of use for an extended period of time.</p>
<p id="e14249ad-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The determination whether the old common law rule should be applied to grants made prior to our decision involves a balancing of equitable and policy considerations. We must balance the injustice which would result from refusing to give effect to the grantor’s intent against the injustice, if any, which might result by failing to give effect to reliance on the old rule and the policy against disturbing settled titles. The record before us does not disclose any reliance upon the old common law rule, and there is no problem of an ancient title. Although in other cases the balancing of the competing interests may warrant application of the common law rule to presently existing deeds, in the instant case the balance falls in favor of the grantor’s intent, and the old common law rule may not be applied to defeat her intent.</p>
<p id="e14249ae-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Willard also contends that the church has received no interest in this case because the clause stated only that the grant was “subject to” the church’s easement, and not that the easement was either excepted or reserved. In construing this provision, however, we must look to the clause as a whole which states that the easement “is given.” Even if we assume that there is some ambiguity or conflict in the clause, the trial court found on substantial evidence that the parties to the deed intended to convey the easement to the church.</p>
<p id="e14249af-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judgment is reversed.</p>

Reservations and exceptions.</i></b> In <i>Willard</i>, the court held that an easement can be reserved in favor of a third party but stated in footnote 1 that an easement cannot be excepted in favor of a third party. What is the difference between an exception and a reservation? How did the court determine that Genevieve McGuigan had reserved rather than excepted an easement? (The deed said “subject to an easement.”)</p>
<p id="e14249b5-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A <i>reservation</i> is a provision in a deed creating some <i>new</i> servitude which did not exist before as an independent interest. For example, <i>O</i> conveys Blackacre to <i>A,</i> reserving a 20-foot-wide easement of way along the south boundary of Blackacre. The easement did not exist as an independent interest prior to the conveyance by <i>O</i>. An <i>exception</i> is a provision in a deed that excludes from the grant some <i>preexisting</i> servitude on the land. For example, after the above conveyance, <i>A</i> conveys Blackacre to <i>B</i>, except for the easement previously reserved by <i>O</i>.</p>
<p id="e14249b6-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the grantor attempted to reserve an easement at early common law, there were difficulties. A new right, such as some feudal obligation or the payment of rent, could be reserved if it was to issue out of the land granted, but the English courts held that an easement could not be reserved because it did not issue out of the land granted. English courts ultimately found a way around this obstacle by inventing the <i>regrant theory.</i> They held that an easement “reserved” by the grantor was not a reservation at all (which would be void), but a <i>regrant</i> of an easement by the grantee to the grantor. Thus a deed from <i>O</i> to <i>A</i> and her heirs, reserving an easement in <i>O</i>, was treated as if it were two deeds. The deed grants <i>A</i> a fee simple; then <i>A</i> is treated as granting an easement back to <i>O.</i></p>
<p id="e14270c7-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The regrant theory may have been a brilliant way around the crabbed interpretation of what could be reserved in a grant, but it brought a new difficulty of its own. Because a reserved easement theoretically involved a regrant by the grantee, the Statute of Frauds required the deed to be signed by the grantee as well as by the grantor. In this country, where deeds are usually signed only by the grantor, this could have caused trouble. But American courts deftly held that the grantee had, by accepting the deed, made it her own and adopted the seal and signature of the grantor! Thus was a legal fiction invented to overcome a faulty premise.</p>
<p id="e14270c8-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now that you understand the difference between a reservation and an exception, does the court’s statement in footnote 1 that an exception cannot vest an easement in a third party make sense?</p>

<p id="e14270cc-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Licenses</i>. An easement must be distinguished from a license. A <i>license</i> is oral or written permission given by the occupant of land allowing the licensee to do some act that otherwise would be a trespass. Licenses are very common: the plumber fixing a drain, the guest coming to dinner, and the purchaser of a theater ticket all have licenses. This privilege to use the land resembles an easement, but a license is revocable, whereas an easement is not.</p>
<p id="e14270cd-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are two distinct exceptions to the rule that a license is revocable. First, a license coupled with an interest cannot be revoked. A license coupled with an interest is one that is incidental to ownership of a chattel on the licensor’s land. For example, <i>O</i> grants to <i>A</i> the right to take timber from Blackacre, owned by <i>O. A</i> has an interest (a <i>profit</i>) and an irrevocable license to enter the land and take the timber. The irrevocability of a license coupled with an interest bears some resemblance to the doctrine of easements by necessity. (See pages 510-512.) The second exception is a license that becomes irrevocable under the rules of estoppel. A license that cannot be revoked is treated as an easement in Restatement (Third) of Property, Servitudes §1.2(4) (2000).</p>

<p id="e14297e5-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For Bauer, a direct connection to the River Road sewer line meant that her driveway would have to be excavated, at substantial cost and inconvenience. The two women talked and reached an accommodation. They agreed that Bauer would install her sewer through a 96-foot-long trench from her home to Van Duyne’s property, where it would share a 207-foot trench with Van Duyne’s connector line to the street. Because of the hilly topography of the area, the pipes were buried at a depth of five <span title="493" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-493">p. 493</span>and one-half feet. Each party bore her own tap and assessment fees. It is not clear from the record as to whether there was any sharing of excavation or installation costs for the sewer line.</p>

The letter directed appellants to “make other arrangements” within 30 days. Subsequent letters from David Kienzle threatened to “cap” the sewer line absent certain concessions.</p>

Appellants answered, denying an encroachment on appellee’s property, maintaining that they possessed an easement, an easement by estoppel, or a prescriptive easement for the sewer line. Appellants also filed a counterclaim, seeking a declaration of easement, an injunction barring appellee from interfering with the sewer line, and damages from the Kienzles for cutting vegetation on appellants’ property.</p>

<p id="e142bf04-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Schmiehausen</i>, a couple purchased a 28-acre parcel with the intention to subdivide. After the purchase, the couple discovered that the land was diagonally bisected by a 900-foot long, 12-inch diameter drainage pipe belonging to a neighboring farmer. Discovery of the pipe resulted in the need to redesign the site plan at some expense. The couple sued the seller, asserting a violation of general warranty covenants.</p>
<p id="e142bf05-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There was evidence in the trial court that the neighboring farmer and the seller’s predecessor in interest reached a gentleman’s agreement for installation of the pipe. The farmer then hired a contractor to install it. The trial court found an easement and awarded damages on the breach of warranty. We affirmed, noting that installation of a 12-inch diameter pipe, 900-feet long, involved a substantial cost by the farmer in reliance on the predecessor in interest’s agreement to permit its installation. We concluded that “[a]pplying either Restatement Section 2.10(1) or Ohio case law, an easement by estoppel was created by the transaction between [the farmer] and [the sellers’] predecessor in interest.” <i>Schmiehausen</i>, 2004 WL 1367278 at ¶ 54.</p>
<p id="e142bf06-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this matter, the trial court distinguished <i>Schmiehausen</i> as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="e142bf07-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court…finds that Defendants cannot establish all the elements necessary to prove estoppel either under common law or the broader Restatement standard. Under common law, an easement claimant must establish reasonable reliance upon a representation, resulting in actual prejudice. In this case, it is undisputed that the construction of the sewer pipe was with Van Duyne’s permission. There is no evidence of misrepresentation. There is also no evidence of prejudice.…</p>
<p id="e142bf08-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court also finds that Defendants cannot establish easement by estoppel under the Restatement standard. The rule under the Restatement is prefaced by the phrase “[i]f injustice can be avoided only by establishment of a servitude.” It is apparent to the Court that the broader Restatement approach was crafted to cover fact situations where otherwise justice cannot be accomplished.…</p>
<p id="e142bf09-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no allegation of concealment or personal substantial expenditure related to the creation of the easement. Therefore, the facts in the present case are not sufficient to fulfill the particular requirement that injustice can be avoided only by establishment of easement by estoppel.</p>
</div>
<p id="e142bf0a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We disagree with the trial court’s analysis. There is no requirement for an easement by estoppel in the common law that a property owner must mislead or misrepresent. The rule simply states that if an owner misleads or causes another in any way to change his or her position to that party’s prejudice, the owner is estopped from denying the existence of an easement. While permissive use may prevent an easement by prescription from arising, in another context an owner’s grant of permission for land use may act as an inducement for another to act, especially when the permission granted is for an act not easily undone.…</p>
<span title="495" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-495">p. 495</span>
<p id="e142bf0b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the present matter, Jo An Van Duyne gave Ruth Bauer permission to install her sewer line in the same trench as Van Duyne’s. There was testimony in the damage phase that plastic sewer lines have a 50-year expected lifespan. It can be reasonably inferred that neither party anticipated that burying a sewer pipe in a five and one-half foot deep trench would be a transient or temporary event. Thus, Van Duyne’s permission reasonably induced appellants’ predecessor in interest to change her position.</p>
<p id="e142bf0c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court also refused to find prejudice in that Bauer would have had to pay for the construction of the sewer pipe even had she located it on her own property. Again, we disagree with this analysis. “Prejudice,” in this context, is used as a synonym for “detriment.” That is, Bauer relied upon Van Duyne’s permission to her prejudice or detriment. This may be shown not only by the expenditures of funds but by the forbearance of some right to which one might otherwise be entitled.</p>
<p id="e142bf0d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While it is true that, in any event, Bauer would have had to spend money to connect to the public sewer, it is also true that but for Van Duyne’s acquiescence to Bauer’s use of her property, Bauer would have linked to the sewer wholly on her own property. Thus, Bauer’s decision to cross Van Duyne’s land constituted a change in position which placed her access to the public sewer out of her control. As the present lawsuit suggests, this decision disadvantaged Bauer.</p>
<p id="e142bf0e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With respect to the Restatement formulation, which is nothing more than a reformulated recitation of the executed parol license doctrine, Restatement, supra, at 145, which has long been accepted in Ohio, we find the trial court’s attempt to distinguish unpersuasive. It would seem that the equities would favor not disturbing a 25-year-old arrangement which seems to have only recently concerned anyone.…</p>
<p id="e142bf0f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>

<p id="e142bf10-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Henry v. Dalton, 151 A.2d 362, 366 (R.I. 1959).</b> “We are of the opinion that in reason and justice the better rule is expressed in the case of Crosdale v. Lanigan, 129 N.Y. 604, 29 N.E. 824. There the plaintiff was required to remove a wall built on the property of the defendant pursuant to a license. The court stated the rule at page 610 of 129 N.Y., at page 825 of 29 N.E. as follows: ‘…a parol license to do an act on the land of the licensor, while it justifies anything done by the licensee before revocation, is, nevertheless, revocable at the option of the licensor, and this, although the intention was to confer a continuing right and money had been expended by the licensee upon the faith of the license. This is plainly the rule of the statute. It is also, we believe, the rule required by public policy. It prevents the burdening of lands with restrictions founded upon oral agreements, easily misunderstood. It gives security and certainty to titles, which are most important to be preserved against defects and qualifications not founded upon solemn instruments. The jurisdiction of courts to enforce oral contracts for the sale of land is clearly defined and well understood, and is indisputable; but to change what commenced in a license into an irrevocable right, on the ground of equitable estoppel, is another and quite different matter. It is far better, we think, that the law requiring interests in land to be evidenced by deed, should be observed, than to leave it to the chancellor to construe an executed license as a grant, depending upon what, in his view, may be equity in the special case…’</p>

We are in accord with this contention, but are not convinced that in the circumstances of the instant case the respondent’s revocation of the complainants’ license is fraudulent within any acceptable definition of that term. The right which complainants seek to establish in the land of the respondent is essentially an easement and should be the subject of a grant, expressed in the solemnity of a written instrument. It is no hardship for one in the position of these complainants either to secure an easement in perpetuity in the manner provided by the statute, or, such being refused, to weigh the advantages inuring to them as against the uncertainty implicit in the making of expenditures on the basis of a revocable license.”</p>

<p id="e142e624-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>1. Status of the easement by estoppel/irrevocable license doctrines.</i></b> Most courts call the interest involved in <i>Kienzle</i> an “irrevocable license.” Other courts call it an “easement by estoppel.” The important point, as the Restatement (Third) of Property, Servitudes (2000), upon which the court in <i>Kienzle</i> relies, recognizes, is the estoppel principle. So, §2.10 comment e of the Restatement states, “Normally the change in position that triggers application of the rule stated in this subsection is an investment in improvements either to the servient estate or to other land of the investor.” See also id. illustration 5. As the excerpt from Henry v. Dalton, above, indicates, however, some courts do not recognize either doctrine for the reasons given by the court in <i>Henry</i>.</p>
<p id="e142e625-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>2. Duration of an irrevocable license.</i></b> For how long does a license made irrevocable by estoppel last? As long as necessary to prevent unjust enrichment by the licensor? That appeared to be the position of the first Restatement (the license remains irrevocable “to the extent reasonably necessary to realize upon [the] expenditures,” Restatement of Property §519(4) (1944)). Restatement (Third) of Property, however, abandons that position in favor of the view that “the irrevocable license is treated the same as any other easement,” unless the parties intended or reasonably expected that it would remain irrevocable only so long as reasonably necessary to recover expenditures. Restatement (Third) of Property, Servitudes ch. 4 Introductory Note, at 496 (2000).</p>
<p id="e142e626-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>3. Requirements of an irrevocable license.</i></b> The usual requirements for a license to become irrevocable are (1) permission by the landowner of another’s use of the land; (2) good-faith reliance on the permission by the licensee, usually by making improvements and such; and (3) landowner’s knowledge (or deemed knowledge, based on the view that she reasonably should have known) of such reliance. See, e.g., Holbrook v. Taylor, 532 S.W.2d 763 (Ky. 1976). How did the court’s analysis in <i>Kienzle</i> compare with this conventional approach? Did the court there apply these requirements?</p>

<p id="e1435a85-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With the character and extent of implied grants, we now have nothing to do. We are here only concerned with determining the circumstances which will give rise to an implied reservation. On this precise question the authorities are in conflict. Courts of high standing assert that the rule regarding implied grants and implied reservations of “visible servitudes” is reciprocal, and that it applies with equal force and in like circumstances to both grants and reservations. But upon a careful consideration of the whole subject, studied in the light of the many cases in which it is discussed, we are convinced that there is a clear distinction between implied grants and implied reservations, and that this distinction is well founded in principle and well supported by authority. It is apparent that no question of public policy is here involved, as we have seen is the case where a way of necessity is involved. To say that a grantor reserves to himself something out of the property granted, <span title="501" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-501">p. 501</span>wholly by implication, not only offends the rule that one shall not derogate from his own grant, but conflicts with the grantor’s language in the conveyance, which, by the rule, is to be taken against him, and is wholly inconsistent with the theory on which our registry laws are based. If such an illogical result is to follow an absolute grant, it must be by virtue of some legal rule of compelling force. The correct rule is, we think, that where, as here, one grants a parcel of land by metes and bounds, by a deed containing full covenants of warranty and without any express reservation, there can be no reservation by implication, unless the easement claimed is one of strict necessity, within the meaning of that term as explained in Dee v. King, 73 Vt. 375.</p>

An easement created by implication arises as an inference of the intentions of the parties to a conveyance of land. The inference is drawn from the circumstances under which the conveyance was made rather than from the language of the conveyance. The easement may arise in favor of the conveyor or the conveyee. In the Restatement of Property, Tentative Draft No. 8, section 28, the factors determining the implication of an easement are stated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="e1435a88-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Sec. 28. Factors Determining Implication of Easements or Profits.</i> In determining whether the circumstances under which a conveyance of land is made imply an easement or a profit, the following factors are important: <i>(a)</i> whether the claimant is the conveyor or the conveyee, <i>(b)</i> the terms of the conveyance, <i>(c)</i> the consideration given for it, <i>(d)</i> whether the claim is made against a simultaneous conveyee, <i>(e)</i> the extent of necessity of the easement or the profit to the claimant, <i>(f)</i> whether reciprocal benefits result to the conveyor and the conveyee, <i>(g)</i> the manner in which the land was used prior to its conveyance, and <i>(h)</i> the extent to which the manner of prior use was or might have been known to the parties.</p>

<p id="e143819a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The extent to which the manner of prior use was or might have been known to the parties.</i> The effect of the prior use as a circumstance in implying, upon a severance of possession by conveyance, an easement or a profit results from an inference as to the intention of the parties. To draw such an inference, the prior use must have been known to the parties at the time of the conveyance, or, at least, have been within the possibility of their knowledge at the time. Each party to a conveyance is bound not merely to what he intended, but also to what he might reasonably have foreseen the other party to the conveyance expected. Parties to a conveyance may, therefore, be assumed to intend the continuance of uses known to them which are in a considerable degree necessary to the continued usefulness of the land. Also they will be assumed to know and to contemplate the continuance of reasonably necessary uses which have so altered the premises as to make them apparent upon reasonably prudent investigation. The degree of necessity required to imply an easement in favor of the conveyor is greater than that required in the case of the conveyee (see comment b). Yet, even in the case of the conveyor, the implication from necessity will be aided by a previous use made apparent by the physical adaptation of the premises to it.</p>

The existing use is often described as a “quasi-easement.” The easement is implied to protect the probable expectations of the grantor and grantee that the existing use will continue after the transfer.

<p id="e143a8d1-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The cases are the same except that the parties are reversed. In Case 1, <i>A</i>, the grantee from <i>O</i>, is the one who claims the easement over the parcel that <i>O</i> retained. In Case 2, the claimant is <i>O</i>, the grantor of Whiteacre, the servient parcel. In Case 2, <i>O</i> claims that she impliedly retained an easement over the parcel that she deeded to <i>A</i>. In this situation, some courts have been more reluctant to imply an easement, on the view that doing so detracts from what the deed apparently conveys to the grantee. So, several jurisdictions, including New York and Texas, follow the old rule that strict necessity is required for implied easements in favor of the grantor. See Houston Bellaire, Ltd. v. TCP LB Portfolio I, L.P., 981 S.W.2d 916 (Tex. Civ. App. 1998). Indeed, at least one court has ruled that reserved easements in favor of the grantor cannot arise on the basis of necessity at all, but only on the basis of a prior use. See Northland Realty, LLC v. Crawford, 953 A.2d 359 (Me. 2008). However, the weight of authority today holds that only reasonable necessity is required for an implied easement, regardless of whether the easement is implied in favor of the grantor or the grantee.</p>

[The Rosiers own tracts of 100 acres and 16.31 acres, over which Othen claims an easement. Along the west side of the Rosiers’ 100 acres runs Belt Line Road, a public highway running north and south. Othen owns tracts of 60 acres and 53 acres, lying to the east of, and contiguous to, the Rosiers’ land (see Figure 10-3).</p>
<p id="e143cfea-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The chronological order of the conveyances of these tracts is as follows. First, Hill conveyed the 100-acre tract on August 26, 1896; by mesne conveyances this tract came into the hands of the Rosiers in 1924. Second, Hill conveyed the 60-acre tract in 1897, and by mesne conveyances Othen acquired it in 1904. These two conveyances left Hill owning the 53-acre tract and the 16.31-acre tract (and possibly other land). On the same day, January 26, 1899, Hill conveyed the 53-acre tract and the 16.31-acre tract to separate purchasers, who conveyed the 53 acres to Othen in 1913 and the 16.31 acres to the Rosiers in 1924.]</p>

That he had accomplished before the happening which precipitated this litigation by going through a gate in the west line of his 60 acres and in the east line of Rosiers’ 16.31 acres, a short but unproved distance south of the south line of Rosiers’ 100 acres; thence west-northwesterly across the 16.31 acres into a fenced lane which runs along the south side of Rosiers’ 100 acres; thence through this lane to a gate, which opens into the Belt Line Road.

<p id="e143cff9-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rosiers’ dwelling house, orchard, stock lots and barns. The Rosiers travel and use the lane above described for such purposes as go with the operation of a farm, as well as for their stock to travel to and from the 16.31 acres, which they use as a pasture and from which they get fire wood. On the 16.31 acres is a tenant house, which has been occupied some of the 18 or 20 years previous to the trial by tenants of the Rosiers; and they have made the same use of the lane as Othen has made. The south fence of this lane was built about 1895. Its north fence and the outside gate were constructed about 1906. Before Othen bought his 60 acres in 1904 he had lived on it for two years as a tenant and had moved away for about a year; and he has continuously used the disputed roadway to get to and from the highway from and to his home.</p>
<p id="e143cffa-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It seems undisputed that the Rosiers made whatever repairs were necessary to keep the land usable. And, so far as the record shows, nobody else recognized any obligation or claimed any right so to keep it. The surface waters flowing into the lane had cut out a large ditch which threatened to encroach across the roadway and render it impassable unless a bridge should be built across it, and these waters threatened erosion damage to Rosiers’ cultivated land. To remedy that situation the Rosiers caused a levee 300 feet long to be constructed as close as possible to the south fence of the lane, with something like half of it in the lane and the other half curving southeasterly into the 16.31 acres. This levee impounded the waters draining southward off Rosiers’ 100 acres and made the lane so muddy that for weeks at a time it was impassable except by horseback, thereby, Othen alleged, depriving him of ingress and egress to and from his farm. So he filed this suit praying a temporary writ of injunction enjoining the Rosiers from further maintaining this levee and a “mandatory writ of injunction commanding and enjoining and restraining the said defendant from further interfering with” his “use of such easement and roadway” and for damages.</p>
<p id="e143cffb-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court found that Othen had an easement of necessity and adjudged it to him “upon, over and across” land of the Rosiers beginning at the northeast corner of the 16.31 acres and extending westward “along the said 16.31 acre tract and having a width of approximately 40 feet” to a point in its north boundary immediately east of the northwest corner of the 16.31 acres, thence across that boundary line and westward along the south boundary line of Rosiers’ 100 acres to its southwest corner and into the Belt Line Road. The judgment further ordered the Rosiers “to take such action as is necessary to put said easement and roadway, so described, in as usable a condition as same was prior to the erection of said levee.”</p>
<p id="e143cffc-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Civil Appeals…concluded that Othen has no easement either of necessity or by prescription and rendered judgment for the Rosiers, Chief Justice Bond dissenting. 221 S.W.2d 594.

<p id="e143f710-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That statement is in line with the recent holding by this court in Bains v. Parker, 143 Texas 57, 182 S.W.2d 397: “Where a vendor retains a tract of land which is surrounded partly by the tract conveyed and partly by the lands of a stranger, there is an implied reservation of a right of way by necessity over the land conveyed where grantor has no other way out.” In 28 C.J.S., Easements, §§34 and 35, pp. 694 et seq., it is made clear that before an easement can be held to be created by implied reservation it must be shown: (1) that there was a unity of ownership of the alleged dominant and servient estates; (2) that the roadway is a necessity, not a mere convenience; and (3) <i>that the necessity existed at the time of severance of the two estates.</i> And see 17 Am.

In determining that question we shall ignore the Duncanville Road to the South, which was established in 1910, as well as the Fish Creek Road to the north, although the record is silent as to when the latter came into existence.</p>
<p id="e143f713-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As already stated, the entire Tone Survey of 2493 acres was owned by one Hill, in whom was unity of ownership of the lands now owned by the parties to this suit. On August 26, 1896, he sold the 100 acres in question to Rosiers’ predecessors in title, retaining the south 60 acres now owned by Othen, which he conveyed on February 20, 1897. In the deed of date August 26, 1896, did he impliedly reserve the roadway easement from the 60 acres, which he retained over and across the 16.31 acres which he did not convey until January 26, 1899, thence on and along the south side of the 100 acres to the Belt Line Road? Obviously, no such easement arose as to the 16.31 acres over which the trial court decreed Othen a roadway, because Hill did not part with his title to it until two years and five months after he sold the 100 acres and about two years after he sold the 60 acres which Othen now owns; one cannot be said to have an easement in lands, the fee simple title to which is in himself. Alley v. Carleton, 29 Texas 74, 94 Am. Dec. 260. Under the record before us we cannot hold that petitioner has shown any implied easement as to the 100 acres by reason of the deed of August 26, 1896, because the record nowhere shows that the roadway along the south line of the 100 acres was a necessity on the date of that deed, rather than a mere convenience. The burden to prove that was on Othen. Bains v. Parker, supra. There was testimony that it was the only outlet to a public road since about 1900 and for the “last 40 years”; <i>but there was none as to the situation on August 26, 1896.</i> One Posey did testify that the owner of the “Othen land” (necessarily the 60 acres) in 1897 “came out up across the south side of the place to the road there,” but he did not testify that it was then the only roadway out. On that proposition his testimony was: “Q. Now, then, <i>is</i> there any other outlet from Mr. Othen’s place to a highway, outside of the road—to a public road? A. Well, I don’t know of any.” (Italics ours.) The record does not show just how much of the Tone Survey Hill owned when he conveyed the 100 acres on August 26, 1896, but it does appear from a stipulation of the parties that he owned as much as 1350 acres of it until January 26, 1899; and Othen’s 53 acres and Rosiers’ 16.31 acres <span title="508" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-508">p. 508</span>were a part of that tract. So, for all the record shows, Hill may easily have been able to cross the 53 acres and around north of the 100 acres on to the Belt Line Road, or he may as easily have been able to go from the 16.31 acres southwesterly to that road across land which he still owned. Certainly Othen should have excluded any such possibility by proof if he would raise an implied reservation in derogation of the warranties in Hill’s deed of date August 26, 1896. Rights claimed in derogation of the warranties are implied with great caution, hence they should be made clearly to appear. Sellers v. Texas Cent. Ry. Co., 81 Texas 458, 17 S.W. 32, 13 L.R.A. 657; Scarborough v. Anderson Bros. Const. Co. (Civ. App.), 90 S.W.2d 305 (er. dism.).</p>
<p id="e143f714-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What we have said determines Othen’s claim to a way of necessity; such an easement necessarily can arise only from an implied grant or implied reservation. This results from [the] rule that the mere fact that the claimant’s land is completely surrounded by the land of another does not, of itself, give the former a way of necessity over the land of the latter, where there is no privity of ownership.…</p>

Collins and others did use the roadway to get to a public road but Sassman and his predecessors in title likewise used it for the same purpose. The court held that under those circumstances the use of the roadway by the claimant and others is presumed to be with the consent of the owner and not adverse.…</p>
<p id="e143f725-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is undisputed that the road along the Rosiers’ 100 acres has been fenced on both sides since about 1906; that the gate opening from the lane into the Belt Line Road was erected at the same time and has been kept closed by the Rosiers and Othen as well as by all parties using the lane as an outlet to the road; that the Rosiers and their tenants have used the lane for general farm purposes as well as to haul wood from the 16.31 acres and to permit their livestock to get to and from the pasture. Under those facts, we conclude that Othen’s use of the roadway was merely permissive, hence constituted only a license, which could not and did not ripen into a prescriptive right.</p>
<p id="e143f726-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But Othen insists that he had prescriptive title of 10 years to the easement before the lane was fenced and the gate opening into the Belt Line Road was erected in 1906, because “at least since 1895 and probably since 1893 said roadway has been established and claimed by petitioner and others.” Othen testified that about 1900 he moved onto the 113 acres in question as a tenant and lived there two years, moved away for about 11 months, then “bought it and moved back.” It is obvious that he did not use the roadway in any way for any period of 10 years prior to 1906. The testimony as to its use by Othen’s predecessors <span title="510" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-510">p. 510</span>is, in our opinion, too vague and uncertain to amount to any evidence of prescriptive right to the roadway decreed by the trial court. For example, when Othen was asked to “tell the court what the condition of that passageway was there,” he answered: “Well, in that day and time it was just prairie and there were some hog wallows which would hold water. You would just pick your place round about; if there was a hog wallow, go around it and come on in. But that was the general direction through there.” Another witness, asked whether in 1901 there was a road “by the side of the present Rosier property,” replied: “It was on the present Rosier property, and at that time went up through the edge of the field.” When asked by Othen’s counsel, “Do you know anything about where this road used to run?”, Mrs. Rosier said: “Well, it didn’t run up exactly next to the Belt Line like it is running now.” It cannot be said that this showed only a slight divergence in the directions taken by the roadway before 1904, therefore Othen did not discharge his burden of showing that his predecessors’ adverse possession was in the same place and within the definite lines claimed by him and fixed by the trial court.…</p>
<p id="e1441e37-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, since Hill did not part with his title to Othen’s alleged dominant estate until 1897 (as to the 60 acres) and until 1899 (as to the 53 acres) and did not part with his title to 16.31 acres of the Rosiers’ alleged servient estate until 1899, Othen could not under any circumstances have perfected prescriptive title to a roadway easement on the 16.31 acres prior to 1906.</p>

<p id="e1444568-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>The theory and requirements of prescriptive easements.</i></b> Most courts analyze prescriptive easements by analogy to adverse possession. In this view, the requirements for a prescriptive easement are usually stated as follows: (1) the use must be adverse and hostile; (2) open and notorious; (3) continuous; and (4) for the statutory period.</p>
<p id="e1444569-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In most states, the statutory period is the same as that required for adverse possession. A few courts use a different theory to explain prescriptive easements. This is the so-called lost grant theory. According to this theory, which derives from historical English law, if a use was shown to have existed for 20 years, courts presumed that the owner granted an easement to the user and that the grant had been lost. This presumption, which was only a legal fiction, could not be rebutted by evidence that no grant had in fact been made.</p>
<p id="e144456a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>The two theories compared: interrupting the statute of limitations.</i></b> Is there any practical difference between the two theories of prescriptive easements? In short, yes, in one situation—how to interrupt the running of the statute of limitations. The lost grant theory draws a confusing distinction between acquiescence and permission. Under lost grant theory, the owner of land is presumed to consent or acquiesce in the use; after all, the owner (or his predecessor) is thought to have granted the easement. On the other hand, if the use is made with the permission of the owner, the use is not adverse. To secure a prescriptive easement under lost grant theory, the claimant must show that the use was not permissive and also that the owner acquiesced (did not object).</p>
<p id="e144456b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider the fiction of the lost grant in relation to the following problem: To reach her land more easily, in 1992, <i>A</i> makes a road across <i>O</i>’s land. In 2003, <i>O</i> writes <i>A</i> a letter saying: “You are hereby notified that the portion of my land that you made into a road is my private property. No person has the right to cross this land, and you are liable to me in damages. I hereby forbid you to pass over any portion of my land, especially that portion that you unlawfully made into a road.” <i>A</i> ignores <i>O</i>’s letter and continues to use the road for the prescriptive period of 20 years. In 2013, does <i>A</i> have a prescriptive easement? See Dartnell v. Bidwell, 98 A. 743 (Me. 1916) (holding that a letter interrupts prescription because it rebuts any claim of acquiescence or grant). Would a letter to a possessor stop adverse possession from running?</p>
<p id="e144456c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a jurisdiction using the adverse possession theory, to prevent a prescriptive easement from being acquired, the owner must effectively interrupt or stop the adverse use. Suppose, under the preceding facts, that in 2007, <i>O</i> had erected a fence across the road, and that <i>A</i> tore down the fence and continued to use the road. Does <i>A</i> acquire a prescriptive easement in 2017? See Restatement (Third) of Property, Servitudes §2.17 comment j illustration 35 (2000). Some states have statutes that allow landowners to interrupt an adverse use by simply giving written <span title="513" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-513">p. 513</span>notice to persons using the owner’s land of the owner’s intent to dispute any claim arising from such use. See, e.g., Conn. Gen. Stat. §47-38 (2015); Iowa Code Ann. §§564.4-564.7 (2015); R.I. Gen. Laws §34-7-6 (2015).</p>
<p id="e144456d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Exclusivity.</i></b> You may have noticed that in identifying the requirements of prescriptive easements in Note 1, we did not include <i>exclusive</i>, which is required for adverse possession. Exclusivity can be a confusing topic in prescriptive easement law. Among the courts that do include exclusivity as a requirement, most define it differently from the adverse possession requirement. “Exclusivity does not require a showing that only the claimant made use of the way, but that the claimant’s right to use the land does not depend upon a like right in others.” Page v. Bloom, 584 N.E.2d 813, 815 (Ill. App. 1991). Thus, in most states, the user can acquire a prescriptive easement even though the easement is also used by the servient owner.</p>
<p id="e144456e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Othen v. Rosier, the court presumed that the use of the road by Othen was permissive rather than adverse because it was not exclusive. Why should this be presumed? In order to gain title by adverse possession, a person must show exclusive possession for the required period. There is good reason for this requirement when one is claiming exclusive ownership of the land ousting the legal owner. But why should it apply so as to bar a claim to a nonexclusive prescriptive easement to be used by the servient owner as well?</p>
<p id="e144456f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Problem.</i></b> Adjacent to Conrad Hilton’s home is a golf club. Every day several golf balls are driven onto Hilton’s property, and the players come onto his property to retrieve them. If this continues, will the golf club acquire a prescriptive easement over Hilton’s property? See MacDonald Properties, Inc. v. Bel-Air Country Club, 140 Cal. Rptr. 367 (Cal. App. 1977) (finding prescriptive easement where golfers hit and retrieved “several balls per day” on neighbor’s land). If so, what should Hilton do to prevent a prescriptive easement from arising?</p>
<p id="e1444570-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. <i>Public prescriptive easements.</i></b> Many courts today recognize a public prescriptive easement on the basis of long continuous use by the public under a claim of right. The landowner must be put on notice, by the kind and extent of use, that an adverse right is being claimed by the general public, not by individuals. This changes the traditional view that the public could not acquire a prescriptive easement.</p>
<p id="e1446c81-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Implied dedication</i>. Some courts use the theory of implied dedication, rather than prescription, for public easements. Dedications may be express or implied. Express dedications are essentially grants and usually involve gratuitous transfers of land to a government body or the public at large. Subdivision maps, for example, commonly contain dedications of roads to the public. The theory of implied dedication owes something to the lost grant fiction, for it seeks a substitute for a grant in an implied dedication. It may be used where the landowner evidences an intent to dedicate, and the state accepts by maintaining the land used by the public. Or implied dedication theory may be used as a substitute for prescription.</p>
<p id="e1446c82-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>6. <i>Beach access, custom, and the public trust doctrine.</i></b> Public access to beaches has become an increasingly important, and controversial, topic in recent years. Under the public trust doctrine, in most states, the state holds, in trust for the public, the beach from the water to the mean high-tide line (the wet sand area). The dry-sand portion of the beach between the mean high-tide line and the vegetation line is subject to private ownership. Public access requires both a way of access from inland to the coast and a lateral easement up and down the beach. The <span title="514" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-514">p. 514</span>prescriptive easement doctrine has not been notably successful in providing public access, largely because most courts presume that public use of beaches is with the permission of the owner, and the burden of proving adverse use cannot be met. See City of Daytona Beach v. Tona-Rama, Inc., 294 So. 2d 73 (Fla. 1974). In a few states, suits for prescriptive easements for beach access have been successful. See Concerned Citizens of Brunswick County Taxpayers Assn. v. Holden Beach Enterprises, 404 S.E.2d 677 (N.C. 1991) (holding pathway to beach could shift over prescriptive period so long as there was substantial identity of use; barricades placed by owner did not destroy the public’s continuity of use because they were ineffective in stopping the public). In California, on the other hand, public prescriptive easements have been abolished by statute except on land within 1,000 yards from the ocean. Even on such land, the landowner can prevent a public prescriptive easement either by posting annually a sign (“Right to pass by permission of the owner, revocable at any time”) or recording a similar notice in the public records. The landowner’s act granting permission defeats any claim of public adverse use. Cal. Civ. Code §1009 (West 2007).</p>

<p id="e1446c85-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Rockefeller Center, in New York City, a private street called Rockefeller Plaza is situated between the GE Building and the sunken skating rink. In order to preserve Rockefeller Center’s right of ownership of the street, each year the street is closed to all traffic, even pedestrian, for one day—a Sunday in July is usually chosen as interfering least with tenants and visitors. Lawyers for Rockefeller Center believe that this formality is necessary to prevent the public from acquiring a permanent right of way in the street.</p>
</div>
<p id="e1446c86-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because beach access is usually presumed to be with the permission of the owner, and because each individual beach access case must be litigated separately under the prescriptive easement doctrine, courts in some jurisdictions have turned to other doctrines with greater potential for opening the beaches. In Florida, Oregon, and Texas, courts have used the medieval doctrine of customary rights—uses that existed for so long that “the memory of man runneth not to the contrary”—and have held that long usage of beaches by the public is protected as a customary right. City of Daytona Beach v. Tona-Rama, Inc., supra; Stevens v. City of Cannon Beach, 854 P.2d 449 (Or. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1207 (1994). Another method of recognizing public access to beaches is the public trust doctrine. The modern version of the public trust doctrine is conventionally traced to the 1892 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. Illinois, 146 U.S. 387 (1892), in which the Court explained that doctrine as “a title held in trust for the people of the State that they may enjoy the navigation of the waters, carry on commerce over them, and have liberty of fishing therein.” Id. at 452. Traditionally, the public trust doctrine extends to all land covered by the ebb and flow of the tide and, in addition, all inland lakes and rivers that are navigable. Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Mississippi, 484 U.S. 469 (1988). In most states today, the list of activities that the public enjoys under the doctrine includes recreation. In Raleigh Avenue Beach Assn. v. Atlantis Beach Club, 879 A.2d 112 (N.J. 2005), the court held that under New Jersey’s public trust doctrine, a private beach club could not unreasonably exclude members of the public from the dry-sand portion of its beach for recreational purposes. In Michigan, the public trust doctrine protects the public right of access to privately owned beaches along the Great Lakes. In Glass v. Goeckel, 703 N.W.2d 58 (Mich. 2005), the court held that public access along the shore is permitted between the current edge of the lake and the “ordinary high water mark.”</p>

Their trespass over a “little” corner of the defendants’ property was inadvertent, and de minimis. The fact that the defendants’ counter claim seeking an injunction to bar plaintiffs’ access to parcel C was filed as leverage against the original plaintiffs’ claim for an interruption of their easement rights, may be considered in determining whether equitable relief by way of an injunction should be granted.</p>
</div>
<p id="e144e1eb-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Relying upon these findings of fact, the court denied defendants’ request for an injunction and granted the plaintiffs the right to use the easement for access to parcels B &amp; C “as long as plaintiffs’ properties (B and C) are developed and used solely for the purpose of a single family residence.” Clerk’s Papers, at 10.</p>
<p id="e144e1ec-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeals reversed, holding [that an injunction must issue].…</p>
<p id="e144e1ed-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The easement in this case was created by express grant. Accordingly, the extent of the right acquired is to be determined from the terms of the grant properly construed to give effect to the intention of the parties. See Zobrist v. Culp, 95 Wash. 2d 556, 561, 627 P.2d 1308 (1981); Seattle v. Nazarenus, 60 Wash. 2d 657, 665, 374 P.2d 1014 (1962). By the express terms of the 1952 grant, the predecessor owners of parcel B acquired a private road easement across parcel A and the right to use the easement for ingress to and egress from parcel B. Both plaintiffs and defendants agree that the 1952 grant created an easement appurtenant to parcel B as the dominant estate. Thus, plaintiffs, as owners of the dominant estate, acquired rights in the use of the easement for ingress to and egress from parcel B.</p>
<p id="e144e1ee-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, plaintiffs have no such easement rights in connection with their ownership of parcel C, which was not a part of the original dominant estate under the terms of the 1952 grant. As a general rule, an easement appurtenant to one parcel of land may not be extended by the owner of the dominant estate to other parcels owned by him, whether adjoining or distinct tracts, to which the easement is not appurtenant. E.g., Heritage Standard Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Trustees of Schs., 84 Ill. App. 3d 653, 40 Ill. Dec. 104, 405 N.E.2d 1196 (1980); Kanefsky v. Dratch Constr. Co., 376 Pa. 188, 101 A.2d 923 (1954); S.S. Kresge Co. of Mich. v. Winkleman Realty Co., 260 Wis. 372, 50 N.W.2d 920 (1952); 28 C.J.S. Easements §92, at 772-73 (1941).</p>
<p id="e144e1ef-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs, nonetheless, contend that extension of the use of the easement for the benefit of nondominant property does not constitute a misuse of the easement, <span title="518" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-518">p. 518</span>whereas here, there is no evidence of an increase in the burden on the servient estate. We do not agree. If an easement is appurtenant to a particular parcel of land, any extension thereof to other parcels is a misuse of the easement. Wetmore v. Ladies of Loretto, Wheaton, 73 Ill. App. 2d 454, 220 N.E.2d 491 (1966). See also, e.g., Robertson v. Robertson, 214 Va. 76, 197 S.E.2d 183 (1973); Penn Bowling Rec. Ctr., Inc. v. Hot Shoppes, Inc., 179 F.2d 64 (D.C. Cir. 1949). As noted by one court in a factually similar case, “[I]n this context this classic rule of property law is directed to the rights of the respective parties rather than the actual burden on the servitude.” National Lead Co. v. Kanawha Block Co., 228 F. Supp. 357, 364 (S.D. W. Va. 1968), aff’d, 409 F.2d 1309 (4th Cir. 1969). Under the express language of the 1952 grant, plaintiffs only have rights in the use of the easement for the benefit of parcel B. Although, as plaintiffs contend, their planned use of the easement to gain access to a single family residence located partially on parcel B and partially on parcel C is perhaps no more than technical misuse of the easement, we conclude that it is misuse nonetheless.</p>
<p id="e144e1f0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, it does not follow from this conclusion alone that defendants are entitled to injunctive relief. Since the awards of $1 in damages were not appealed, only the denial of an injunction to defendants is in issue. Some fundamental principles applicable to a request for an injunction must be considered. (1) The proceeding is equitable and addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court. (2) The trial court is vested with a broad discretionary power to shape and fashion injunctive relief to fit the <i>particular facts, circumstances, and equities of the case before it.</i> Appellate courts give great weight to the trial court’s exercise of that discretion. (3) One of the essential criteria for injunctive relief is actual and substantial injury sustained by the person seeking the injunction.</p>
<p id="e144e1f1-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court found as facts, upon substantial evidence, that plaintiffs have acted reasonably in the development of their property, that there is and was no damage to the defendants from plaintiffs’ use of the easement, that there was no increase in the volume of travel on the easement, that there was no increase in the burden on the servient estate, that defendants sat by for more than a year while plaintiffs expended more than $11,000 on their project, and that defendants’ counterclaim was an effort to gain “leverage” against plaintiffs’ claim. In addition, the court found from the evidence that plaintiffs would suffer considerable hardship if the injunction were granted whereas no appreciable hardship or damages would flow to defendants from its denial. Finally, the court limited plaintiffs’ use of the combined parcels solely to the same purpose for which the original parcel was used—i.e., for a single family residence.</p>
<p id="e144e1f2-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Neither this court nor the Court of Appeals may substitute its effort to make findings of fact for those supported findings of the trial court.…Therefore, the only valid issue is whether, under these established facts, as a matter of law, the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendants’ request for injunctive relief. Based upon the equities of the case, as found by the trial court, we are persuaded that the trial court acted within its discretion. The Court of Appeals is reversed and the trial court is affirmed.</p>

By prescription, <i>A</i> has acquired, as the owner and possessor of Blackacre, an easement of way over an alley leading from Blackacre to the street. He buys Whiteacre, an adjacent lot, to which the way is not appurtenant, and builds a public garage one-fourth of which is located on Blackacre and three-fourths of which is located on Whiteacre. <i>A</i> wishes to use the alley as a means of ingress and egress to and from the garage. He has no privilege to use the alley to go to that part of the garage which is built on Whiteacre, and he may not use the alley until that part of the garage built on Blackacre is so separated from the part built on Whiteacre that uses for the benefit of Blackacre are distinguishable from those which benefit Whiteacre.</p>
</div>
<p id="e1450906-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority grants the privilege to extend the agreement to nondominant property on the basis that the trial court found no appreciable hardship or damage to the servient owners. However, as conceded by the majority, any extension of the use of an easement to benefit a nondominant estate constitutes a misuse of the easement. Misuse of an easement is a trespass. Raven Red Ash Coal Co. v. Ball, 184 Va. 534, 39 S.E.2d 231 (1946); Selvia v. Reitmeyer, 156 Ind. App. 203, 295 N.E.2d 869 (1973). The Browns’ use of the easement to benefit parcel C, especially if they build their home as planned, would involve a continuing trespass for which damages would be difficult to measure. Injunctive relief is the appropriate remedy under these circumstances. <i>Selvia</i>, at 212, 295 N.E.2d 869; Gregory v. Sanders, 635 P.2d 795, 801 (Wyo. 1981). In Penn Bowling Rec. Ctr., Inc. v. Hot Shoppes, Inc., 179 F.2d 64, 66 (D.C. Cir. 1949), the court states:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="e1450907-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is contended by appellant that since the area of the dominant and nondominant land served by the easement is less than the original area of the dominant tenement, the use made by appellant of the right of way to serve the building located on the lesser area is not materially increased or excessive. It is true that where the nature and extent of the use of an easement is, by its terms, unrestricted, the use of the dominant tenement may be increased or enlarged.…But the owner of the dominant tenement may not subject the servient tenement to use or servitude in connection with other premises to which the easement is not appurtenant. See Williams v. James, Eng. Law. Rep. (1867), 2 C.P. 577. And when an easement is being used in such a manner, an injunction will be issued to prevent such use. Cleve et al. v. Nairin, 204 Ky. 342, 264 S.W. 741 [(1924)]; Diocese of Trenton v. Toman et al., 74 N.J. Eq. 702, 70 A. 606 [(1908)]; Shock v. Holt Lumber Co. et al., 107 W. Va. 259, 148 S.E. 73 [(1929)]. Appellant, therefore, may not use the easement to serve both the dominant and nondominant property, even though the area thereof is less than the original area of the dominant tenement.</p>
</div>
<p id="e1450908-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">See also Kanefsky v. Dratch Constr. Co., 376 Pa. 188, 101 A.2d 923 (1954). Thus, the fact that an extension of the easement to nondominant property would not increase the burden on the servient estate does not warrant a denial of injunctive relief.</p>
<p id="e1450909-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Browns are responsible for the hardship of creating a landlocked parcel. They knew or should have known from the public records that the easement was not appurtenant to parcel C. See Seattle v. Nazarenus, 60 Wash. 2d 657, 670, 374 P.2d 1014 (1962). In encroachment cases this factor is significant. As stated by the court in Bach v. Sarich, 74 Wash. 2d 575, 582, 445 P.2d 648 (1968): “The benefit of the doctrine of balancing <span title="520" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-520">p. 520</span>the equities, or relative hardship, is reserved for the innocent defendant who proceeds without knowledge or warning that his structure encroaches upon another’s property or property rights.”</p>
<p id="e145090a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition, an injunction would not interfere with the Browns’ right to use the easement as expressly granted, i.e., for access to parcel B. An injunction would merely require the Browns to acquire access to parcel C if they want to build a home that straddles parcels B and C. One possibility would be to condemn a private way of necessity over their existing easement in an action under RCW 8.24.010. See Brown v. McAnally, 97 Wash. 2d 360, 644 P.2d 1153 (1982).</p>
<p id="e145090b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I would affirm the Court of Appeals decision as a correct application of the law of easements. If the Browns desire access to their landlocked parcel they have the benefit of the statutory procedure for condemnation of a private way of necessity.</p>

<p id="e145090e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All of the tracts involved in Brown v. Voss were on a wooded hillside overlooking Hood Canal. Professor Elizabeth Samuels has determined that Figure 10-5, reproduced in the court’s opinion, is inaccurate or deceptive in several respects. In her article, Elizabeth Samuels, Brown v. Voss, in Stories Out of School: Teaching the Case of <i>Brown v. Voss</i>, 16 Cardozo L. Rev. 1445 (1995), she points out, first, that all three parcels fronted on, and had access to, State Road 101, which parallels Hood Canal. The map does not make this clear. Second, Parcel B is a long, narrow lot consisting of 1.4 acres. Parcel C is 5.05 acres, three and a half times larger. Third, the map suggests that the house would be located on Parcel B or straddling the property line. Brown testified at the trial that the exact location of the house had not been determined, and Professor Samuels, inspecting the property after the lawsuit, discovered that the Browns had prepared a large, flat area high up on Parcel C, which she thought was “a perfect site for a large house.”</p>
<p id="e145090f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Browns bought their two parcels directly from the sellers, without consulting a real estate broker or a lawyer. They started using the easement in November 1977 to clear their parcels and bring in fill. They did not tell the Vosses what they were going to build on their property or where they were going to build. They did not seek permission to use the easement to benefit Parcel C, because they assumed they could use the easement to service their entire tract. Throughout the dispute, the Browns did not attempt to bargain with the Vosses, because they thought the Vosses had no right about which it was necessary to bargain. They believed it was none of the Vosses’ business what they were going to build on their tract.</p>
<p id="e1450910-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Smarting from not knowing what was going on as the trucks were going in and out, and not being consulted about where the new road would go on the Browns’ land, Voss got his dander up. He began raising objections. He disputed the location of the easement and complained that Brown and his contractors were trespassing, both through their driving off of the easement and by backing up and turning vehicles on a triangular piece of the Vosses’ land where the easement joined Parcel B. Voss erected a chain link fence along the east side of the easement, which Brown believed encroached on the easement.</p>
<p id="e1452f21-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Brown was in no mood to negotiate. He hired a surveyor and invited Voss to join him in walking the property line between their tracts as well as the location of the easement, but he told Voss he was only to listen and not to talk with either him or the surveyor. Voss was highly offended by this. He thought Brown downright unneighborly. The quarreling continued for several months until the parties came to blows. Brown said Voss assaulted him, and Voss said Brown, who was 15 years younger, knocked him down. Voss unsuccessfully sought to have <span title="521" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-521">p. 521</span>Brown prosecuted for assault, and the Browns’ lawyer sent Voss a letter threatening legal action against him. A few months later the Browns filed their lawsuit to enjoin the Vosses from interfering with their easement. In the lawsuit, the Browns complained that the Vosses had intentionally placed logs and a concrete sump on the easement “preventing its full use.”</p>
<p id="e1452f22-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After the lawsuit was filed, the Vosses hired a lawyer, who advised them to counterclaim for an injunction preventing the Browns from using the easement to reach Parcel C. The original dispute over location and misuse of the easement now turned into a legal issue of use of the easement by nondominant land. To the Browns, this counterclaim came as a bolt out of the blue—something Voss had never complained of before. The Browns’ position in reply was that Parcels B and C had merged into one tract with one owner, that the parcel lines had disappeared, and that they had a right to use the easement to service their entire tract. They thought the traditional rule against use by nondominant land made no sense because, if they located their house straddling the former parcel lines, they would be permitted to enter one part of their house and not another. Moreover, the Browns had bought the two lots with the idea of building a large new home—a home that might be too large to erect on Parcel B alone—and they testified that they would not have bought these lots had they known of this limitation on the easement. They felt terribly wronged by this new claim by the Vosses, which they viewed as spiteful and entirely unreasonable. And in the trial their lawyer presented their position exactly this way.</p>
<p id="e1452f23-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Vosses’ lawyer believed the case turned solely on the rule that an easement cannot be extended to nondominant land. As a result, at the trial he did not let the Vosses tell their story—how they had tried to be good neighbors and how uncooperative the Browns had been. He viewed this as irrelevant. The Vosses’ lawyer also made what was perhaps a crucial error: he did not offer into evidence a correct map of the properties, which would show that Parcel C had direct access to Route 101 and was not landlocked.</p>
<p id="e1452f24-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial and appeals dragged on for seven years. Finally, the Washington Supreme Court ruled that although the legal rule that an easement cannot be used for nondominant land is enforceable—in this case, only by an award of damages of $1—the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Vosses injunctive relief. The Vosses’ lawyer wrote them that they had won the case. Subsequently, when a bill for the Browns’ legal costs arrived, they were rather surprised, but they paid it without complaint. By this time, the Browns were out of the picture.</p>
<p id="e1452f25-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Browns were not able to build their dream house. They had bought Parcel B on an installment land contract and, after failing to make payments to the seller while the lawsuit was proceeding, the seller declared a forfeiture. The Browns lost Parcel C in a tax sale resulting from their failure to pay taxes on the property for three years. Dogged by financial reverses, the Browns pulled up stakes and moved to Alaska before the Washington Supreme Court handed down its decision. The owner of Parcel B, who had sold it to the Browns, now sold it to the Vosses, thereby merging Parcels A and B into common ownership, terminating the bitterly contested easement.</p>
<p id="e1452f26-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When Professor Samuels contacted Mr. Brown by telephone in Alaska, “[f]ifteen years after the lawsuit began, he continued to express frustration and anger with Mr. Voss, whom he called ‘one of the scum-baggiest persons I’ve ever met’ [and whose wife he called a ‘bozo’]. When he learned near the end of our conversation that Mr. Voss now owns Parcel B, he commented—after long moments of silence—that Mr. Voss did not deserve to have the property and that ‘it’s unfortunate we didn’t bury him right there.”’ Id. at 1487.</p>

<p id="e1452f29-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>The traditional rule.</i></b> According to the traditional rule, still followed in most jurisdictions, an easement may not be used in connection with a nondominant estate, and any such use is subject to an injunction. The Restatement (Third) of Property, Servitudes §4.11 (2000), endorses the conventional rule. Brown v. Voss departs from the traditional rule and has been the subject of a fair amount of commentary, both pro and con. See, e.g., Lee Strang, Damages as the Appropriate Remedy for “Abuse” of an Easement: Moving Toward Consistency, Efficiency, and Fairness in Property Law, 15 Geo. Mason L. Rev. 933 (2008); Stewart E. Sterk, Property Rules, Liability Rules, and Uncertainty About Property Rights, 106 Mich. L. Rev. 1285, 1323-1327 (2008). What is your reaction to the court’s analysis? Do you think Voss would have sold an extension of the easement to include lot C for only one dollar, the amount of damages that the court awarded?</p>

The documents creating the easement in that case did not specify an exact width of the easement. The court endorsed the position adopted in Restatement (Third) of Property, Servitudes §4.8(3) (2000), which provides: “Unless expressly denied by the terms of an easement . . . the owner of the servient estate is entitled to make reasonable changes in the location or dimensions of an easement, at the servient owner’s expense, to permit normal use or development of the servient estate, but only if the changes do not (a) significantly lessen the utility of the easement, (b) increase the burdens on the owner of the easement in its use and enjoyment, or (c) frustrate the purpose for which the easement was created.”</p>

For example, a prescriptive easement acquired by pedestrian traffic or by herding livestock with men and horses across land has been held not usable by motor vehicles. “Anyone who does not think there is a significant difference between horses and motorcycles may wish to ponder why it is that carriages in Central Park are pulled by horses, not Hondas.” Connolly v.

In this case, the railroad shut down service in 1970, and in 1975 removed the railroad tracks, but it never applied to the ICC for an abandonment order. In 1985, the railroad entered into an agreement with the state of Vermont and the city of Burlington that the latter would maintain the former railroad strip as a public trail. In 1986, the ICC approved the trails agreement and authorized the railroad to discontinue service. The owners of the underlying fee simple over which the tracks formerly ran—the Preseaults—sued, claiming the Rails-to-Trails Act was unconstitutional. In Preseault v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 494 U.S. 1 (1990), the United States Supreme Court held that the act was constitutional as an appropriate exercise of congressional power to regulate interstate commerce, but further held that the Preseaults may have a remedy under the Fifth Amendment for a taking of their property as defined by state law:</p>

<p id="e145a475-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Preseaults own a fee simple interest in a tract of land near the shore of Lake Champlain in Burlington, Vermont, on which they have a home. This tract of land is made up of several previously separate properties, the identities of which date back to before the turn of the century. The dispute centers on three parcels within this tract, areas over which the original railroad right-of-way ran. The areas are designated by the trial court as parcels A, B, and C. Two of those parcels, A and B, derive from the old Barker Estate property. The third parcel, C, is part of what was the larger Manwell property.</p>
<p id="e145a476-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Rutland-Canadian Railroad Company, a corporation organized under the laws of Vermont, acquired in 1899 the rights-of-way at issue on parcels A, B, and C, over which it laid its rails and operated its railroad.…</p>

If, on the other hand, the Railroad acquired only easements for use, easements imposed on the property owners’ underlying fee simple estates, and if those easements were limited to uses that did not include public recreational hiking and biking trails (“nature trails” as Justice Brennan referred to them), or if the easements prior to their conversion to trails had been extinguished by operation of law leaving the property owner with unfettered fee simples, the argument of the Preseaults becomes viable.</p>
<p id="e145a47d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The determinative issues in the case, then, are three: (1) who owned the strips of land involved, specifically did the Railroad by the 1899 transfers acquire only easements, or did it obtain fee simple estates; (2) if the Railroad acquired only easements, were the terms of the easements limited to use for railroad purposes, or did they include future use as public recreational trails; and (3) even if the grants of the Railroad’s easements were broad enough to encompass recreational trails, had these easements terminated prior to the alleged taking so that the property owners at that time held fee simples unencumbered by the easements.…</p>

It surveyed and located the land it wanted for its tracks, and, since the land owners and the Railroad could not agree on the damages to be paid, three disinterested commissioners were appointed who fixed the damages and executed the Commissioner’s Award. The document made no reference to an easement or a fee simple.] In her opinion, the trial judge concluded that… “the portion of the right-of-way consisting of the parcel of land condemned from the Barker Estate and taken by commissioner’s award is indisputably an easement under the law of the State of Vermont.” [Preseault v.

Here, the evidence is that the Railroad had obtained a survey and location of its right-of-way, after which the Manwell deed was executed confirming and memorializing the Railroad’s action. On balance it would seem that, consistent with the view expressed in <i>Hill</i>, the proceeding retained its eminent domain flavor, and the railroad acquired only that which it needed, an easement for its roadway. Nothing the Government points to or that we can find in the later cases would seem to undermine that view of the case; the trial court’s conclusion that the estate conveyed was an easement is affirmed.…</p>

Both the Government and the State argue that…the scope of the original easements, admittedly limited to railroad purposes, is properly construed today to include other public purposes as well, and that these other public purposes include a public recreational hiking and biking trail. Under that theory of the case, the establishment in 1986 of such a trail would be within the scope of the easements presumably now in the State’s hands, and therefore the Preseaults would have no complaint. On the other hand, if the Government’s use of the land for a recreational trail is not within the scope of the easements, then that use would constitute an unauthorized invasion of the land to which the Preseaults hold title.

<p id="e145f2b3-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the easements here were granted to the Preseaults’ predecessors in title at the turn of the century, specifically for transportation of goods and persons via railroad, could it be said that the parties contemplated that a century later the easements would be used for recreational hiking and biking trails, or that it was necessary to so construe them in order to give the grantee railroad that for which it bargained? We think not. Although a public recreational trail could be described as a roadway for the transportation of persons, the nature of the usage is clearly different. In the one case, the grantee is a commercial enterprise using the easement in its business, the transport of goods and people for compensation. In the other, the easement belongs to the public, and is open for use for recreational purposes, which happens to involve people engaged in exercise or recreation on foot or on bicycles. It is difficult to imagine that either party to the original transfers had anything remotely in mind that would resemble a public recreational trail.</p>
<p id="e145f2b4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Furthermore, there are differences in the degree and nature of the burden imposed on the servient estate. It is one thing to have occasional railroad trains crossing one’s land. Noisy though they may be, they are limited in location, in number, and in frequency of occurrence. Particularly is this so on a relatively remote spur. When used for public recreational purposes, however, in a region that is environmentally attractive, the burden imposed by the use of the easement is at the whim of many individuals, and, as the record attests, has been impossible to contain in numbers or to keep strictly within the parameters of the easement.…</p>

The Preseaults contend that under Vermont law the original easements were abandoned, and thus extinguished, in 1975. If that is so, the State could not, over ten years later in 1986, have re-established the easement even for the narrow purposes provided in the original conveyances without payment of the just compensation required by the Constitution.…</p>
<p id="e145f2b9-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Typically the grant under which such rights-of-way are created does not specify a termination date. The usual way in which such an easement ends is by abandonment, which causes the easement to be extinguished by operation of law. See generally Restatement of Property §504. Upon an act of abandonment, the then owner of the fee estate, the “burdened” estate, is relieved of the burden of the easement. In most jurisdictions, including Vermont, this happens automatically when abandonment of the easement occurs.…</p>
<p id="e145f2ba-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Vermont law recognizes the well-established proposition that easements, like other property interests, are not extinguished by simple non-use. As was said in Nelson v. Bacon, 113 Vt. 161, 32 A.2d 140, 146 (1943), “one who acquires title to an easement in this manner [by deed in that case] has the same right of property therein as an owner of the fee and it is not necessary that he should make use of his right in order to maintain his title.” Thus in cases involving a passageway through an adjoining building (<i>Nelson</i>), or a shared driveway (Sabins v. McAllister, 116 Vt. 302, 76 A.2d 106 (1950), overruled in part on other grounds by Lague v. Royea, 152 Vt. 499, 568 A.2d 357 (1989)), the claimed easement was not extinguished merely because the owner had not made use of it regularly.</p>
<p id="e145f2bb-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Something more is needed. The Vermont Supreme Court in <i>Nelson</i> summarized the rule in this way: “In order to establish an abandonment there must be in addition to nonuser, acts by the owner of the dominant tenement conclusively and unequivocally manifesting <i>either</i> a present intent to relinquish the easement or a purpose inconsistent with its future existence.” <i>Nelson</i>, 32 A.2d at 146 (emphasis added); see also <i>Lague</i>, 152 Vt. at 503, 568 A.2d at 359; Barrett v. Kunz, 158 Vt. 15, 604 A.2d 1278 (1992). The record here establishes that these easements, along with the other assets of the railroad, came into the hands of the State of Vermont in the 1960s. The State then leased them to an entity called the Vermont Railway, which operated trains over them. In 1970, the Vermont Railway ceased active transport operations on the line which included the right-of-way over the parcels at issue, and used the line only to store railroad cars. In 1975 the Railroad removed all of the railroad equipment, including switches and tracks, from the portion of the right-of-way running over the three parcels of land now owned by the Preseaults. In light of these facts, the trial court concluded that under Vermont law this amounted to an abandonment of the easements, and adjudged that the easements were extinguished as a matter of law in 1975.…</p>
<p id="e145f2bc-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Government and the State argue that there are facts inconsistent with that determination, but we are not persuaded that any of them significantly undercut the trial court’s conclusion. For example, when the Vermont Railway removed its tracks in 1975, <span title="530" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-530">p. 530</span>it did not remove the two bridges or any of the culverts on the line, all of which remained “substantially intact.” That is not surprising. The Railroad was under no obligation to restore the former easement to its original condition. Tearing out existing structures would simply add to its costs, whereas the rails that were taken up could be used for repairs of defective rails elsewhere on the line. It is further argued that, since the rail line continues to operate to a point approximately one and one-third miles south of the Preseaults’ property, it is possible to restore the line to full operation. The fact that restoration of the northern portion of the line would be technically feasible tells us little. The question is not what is technically possible to do in the future, but what was done in the past.</p>
<p id="e14619cd-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Almost immediately after the tracks were removed, members of the public began crossing over the easement. Perhaps illustrating the difficulty in getting government paperwork to catch up with reality, or perhaps indicating that revenue collectors do not give up easily, the State of Vermont and Vermont Railway, as they had done before the removal of the tracks, continued to collect fees under various license and crossing agreements from persons wishing to establish fixed crossings. In January 1976, the Preseaults executed a crossing agreement with the Vermont Railway which gave the Preseaults permission to cross the right-of-way. In March 1976, the Preseaults entered into a license agreement with the State and the Vermont Railway to locate a driveway and underground utility service across the railroad right-of-way. As late as 1991, 985 Associates (through Paul Preseault) paid a $10 license fee to “Vermont Railroad” (sic), presumably pursuant to one of the 1976 agreements. The Preseaults paid “under protest.” Much of this activity suggests that, initially at least, the adjacent property owners decided it was cheaper to pay a nominal license fee to the State than to litigate the question of whether the State had the right to extract the fee. In view of all the contrary evidence of physical abandonment, we find this behavior by the State’s revenue collectors unconvincing as persuasive evidence of a purpose or intent not to abandon the use of the right-of-way for actual railroad purposes.</p>
<p id="e14619ce-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One uncontrovertible piece of evidence in favor of abandonment is that, in the years following the shutting down of the line in 1970 and the 1975 removal of the tracks, no move has been made by the State or by the Railroad to reinstitute service over the line, or to undertake replacement of the removed tracks and other infrastructure necessary to return the line to service.…Other events occurring after 1975 are also of little probative value.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10CA6_5eaa6106-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10CA6_5eaa6106-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">9</a></span></p>

<p id="e14619d3-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In due course an eight foot wide paved strip was established on the former right-of-way over parcels A, B, and C. The path is some 60 feet from the Preseaults’ front door. On each side of the Preseaults’ driveway, where it crosses the easement, two concrete posts and one metal post were installed to block automobile traffic. The city also erected two stop signs on the path and built a water main under and along the path. The Preseaults have been unable to build on the land under the easement or to construct a driveway connecting their land through parcels A and B to the nearest public street.</p>
<p id="e14619d4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The path is used regularly by members of the public for walking, skating, and bicycle riding.

The record establishes two bases on which the Preseaults are entitled to recover. One, if the easements were in existence in 1986 when, pursuant to ICC Order, the City of Burlington established the public recreational trail, its establishment could not be justified under the terms and within the scope of the existing easements for railroad purposes. The taking of possession of the lands owned by the Preseaults for use as a public trail was in effect a taking of a new easement for that new use, for which the landowners are entitled to compensation.</p>
<p id="e14619d6-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two, as an alternative basis, in 1986 when the ICC issued its Order authorizing the City to establish a public recreational biking and pedestrian trail on parcels A, B, and C, there was as a matter of state law no railroad easement in existence on those parcels, nor had there been for more than ten years. The easement had been abandoned in 1975, and the properties were held by the Preseaults in fee simple, unencumbered by any former property rights of the Railroad. When the City, pursuant to federal authorization, took possession of parcels A, B, and C and opened them to public use, that was a physical taking of the right of exclusive possession that belonged to the Preseaults as an incident of their ownership of the land.</p>

<p id="e14640ec-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether, at the time a railroad applies to abandon its use of an easement limited to railroad purposes, a taking occurs under an ICC order to “railbank” the easement for possible future railroad use, and allowing in the interim for use of the easement for trail purposes, is a question not now before us. We offer no opinion at this time on that question. We conclude that the occupation of the Preseaults’ property by the City of Burlington under the authority of the Federal Government constituted a taking of their property for which the Constitution requires that just compensation be paid.

The easement owner may agree to <i>release</i> the easement. Because easements are interests in property, subject to the Statute of Frauds, normally a release requires a writing. If the duration of an easement is limited in some way, it ends through <i>expiration</i> at the end of the stated period. Similarly, an easement created to end upon the occurrence of some event (sometimes called a <i>defeasible easement</i>) expires automatically if and when the stated event occurs. Easements by necessity end when the necessity that gave rise to it ends. See Note 5 on page 511. An easement ends by <i>merger</i> if the easement owner later becomes the owner of the servient estate. An easement may end through <i>estoppel</i> if the servient owner reasonably relies upon a statement or representation by the easement owner. As <i>Preseault</i> indicates, an easement may terminate by <i>abandonment</i>. Normally, mere non-use by the easement owner does not constitute abandonment, but in several states a prescriptive easement ends by abandonment upon non-use for the statutory period of time. See Zadnichek v. Fidler, 894 So. 2d 702 (Ala. App. 2004) (holding non-use alone does not constitute abandonment of a right-of-way easement but suggesting that the benefitted owner’s act of obtaining alternative means of access to the benefited parcel could constitute evidence of intent to abandon). An easement may terminate by <i>condemnation</i> if the government exercises its eminent domain power to take title to a fee interest in the servient estate for a purpose that is inconsistent with continued existence of the easement. Finally, an easement may be terminated by <i>prescription</i>. If the servient owner wrongfully and physically prevents the easement from being used for the prescriptive period, the easement is terminated. Spiegel v. Ferraro, 541 N.E.2d 15 (N.Y. 1989); Faulconer v. Williams, 964 P.2d 246 (Or. 1998); Restatement (Third) of Property, Servitudes §7.7 (2000).</p>

Ct. 1257 (2014), the Supreme Court faced the question of what happens when a federally-granted statutory railroad right-of-way over public land was abandoned. Does it go to the federal government or to the private party who acquired the land underlying the right-of-way? In <i>Brandt</i>, the government conveyed a fee interest in a parcel of public land to the Brandt family in 1976, subject to the railroad’s underlying right-of-way. Later, the railroad abandoned the easement, and the government claimed ownership. The Brandts resisted, arguing that the right-of-way was simply an easement, and, under ordinary common law rules, when it was terminated by abandonment the burden on their servient estate was removed, giving them clear title. The government responded that it had retained a reversionary interest all along, one that would become possessory in fee upon abandonment.</p>
<p id="e146680f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By an 8-1 vote, the Supreme Court held that prior case law provided a definitive construction of the 1875 federal act granting the government power to convey easements to railroads, and that under that construction, the statute gave no rights to the United States in the underlying land. Hence the government could not repurpose the abandoned right-of-way land for recreational trail use. See Danaya C. Wright, Rails to Trails: Conversion of Railroad Corridors to Recreational Trails, Powell on Real Property ch. 78A (Michael Allan Wolf ed., 2009).</p>

<p id="e1466812-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A <i>negative easement</i> is the right of the dominant owner to stop the servient owner from doing something on the servient land. English common law recognized only a small number of these. English courts did not recognize any other types of negative easements, however, in part because until 1925, England had no effective system of public records of land titles, making discovering of negative easements very difficult.</p>
<p id="e1466813-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">American courts also disfavored negative easements, although their approach has been a bit more welcoming. For example, in Petersen v. Friedman, 328 P.2d 264 (Cal. App. 1958), the court enforced an express easement of unobstructed view of the San Francisco Bay over a neighbor’s house, compelling the neighbor to remove obstructing television aerials. In England, the right to an unspoiled view cannot exist as an easement. A solar easement, preventing a person from blocking a neighbor’s solar collector, has also been recognized in this country.</p>
<p id="e1466814-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The most noteworthy new negative easement is the conservation easement, developed in the last 40 years to preserve scenic and historic areas and open space. An owner of land can give a public body or a private charitable organization (such as a land trust) a conservation easement, preventing the servient owner from building on the land except as specified in the grant. The value of the conservation easement (which is usually the development value of the land) is deductible as a charitable gift on income tax returns. Statutes, such as the Uniform Conservation Easement Act, have been enacted in almost all states authorizing conservation easements.</p>
<p id="e1466815-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the English law courts closed the books on negative easements 150 years ago, chancery soon thereafter began to enforce negative covenants between the parties as equitable servitudes (see page 538). Equitable servitudes became the equivalent of negative easements, but subject to a different set of rules developed in chancery. The American courts followed suit. Today negative restrictions on land are usually treated as equitable servitudes. American courts sometimes refer <span title="534" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-534">p. 534</span>to equitable servitudes as negative easements, but that simply underlies both the similarity of these interests and equity’s circumvention of the law.</p>

<p id="e1468f29-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this section, we will study land use interests that are created by covenants, or promises. As we noted at the beginning of the chapter, traditional doctrine categorically distinguishes between two types of such interests—<i>real covenants</i> and <i>equitable servitudes</i>. More recently, however, the Restatement (Third) of Property, Servitudes (2000), discards this distinction, and many of the old rules with it, in an attempt to create a unified law of servitudes that is both more modern and more coherent. But the traditional distinction, with its rules, still survives in most jurisdictions. Hence we will first examine the traditional approach, and then briefly look at the Restatement’s revisions.</p>

<p id="e1468f2c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After the law courts refused to recognize new types of negative easements, landowners looked for a new doctrinal basis for their attempts to impose restrictions on the use of land. They found one in the law of contracts, but with a twist. What the landowners wanted was judicial recognition of a contract right respecting land use enforceable not only against the promisor landowner, but against his successors in title as well.</p>
<p id="e1468f2d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why were landowners so interested in imposing restrictions on the use of land? Suppose that <i>O</i> owns a large tract of land on which he wants to put several different uses—a factory, a residence, and a market. If <i>O</i> wishes to maximize the value of all parts of his tract, he will locate these uses so as to minimize the harms they might impose on each other. Because a factory produces smoke and a grocery produces traffic, <i>O</i> may place them at some distance from each other and from the residence.</p>
<p id="e1468f2e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, bargains among neighbors can serve to minimize the harmful impacts (“external costs”) that arise from conflicting resource uses. Suppose, for example, <i>A</i> (owner of a vacant lot on Whiteacre) and <i>B</i> (owner of a vacant lot on Blackacre) are neighbors who reciprocally agree not to use their respective lots for factories. Presumably, the agreement between <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> maximizes their well-being (and society’s too, if there are no third-party effects that <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> have neglected to take into account). The value of both Whiteacre and Blackacre for residential use is presumably greater than the value of the opportunities for industrial use that have been forgone.</p>
<p id="e1468f2f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is a hitch, however. Such bargains are less likely to be struck if only the original promisor is bound and only the original promisee benefited. The promisee wants assurances that he and his successors in interest will be protected against the original promisor and her successors in interest. What is needed, then, is some sort of <i>property right</i> that is enforceable by and against subsequent purchasers of Whiteacre and Blackacre. A mere contract right—the right of the original promisee to sue the original promisor alone—will seldom be sufficient to enable the market to allocate conflicting land uses efficiently. Do you see why? The answer relates to the discussion of transaction costs at pages 35-37. See also James E. Krier, Book Review, 122 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1664, 1678-1680 (1974).</p>

<p id="e146b642-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the early nineteenth century, contract rights and duties were not generally assignable. The law had, however, developed one exception to the rule of nonassignability. <i>Where there is privity of estate</i>, the judges held, the contract is enforceable by and against assignees. It had long been established that privity of estate existed between a landlord and a tenant and that most covenants in leases would run with the land. Landowners in England tried to persuade the law courts to expand the required relationship of privity of estate to include contracts between neighbors so that the contracts would be enforceable against successor landowners. These attempts ultimately failed. The courts concluded that privity of estate, required for the burden of a covenant to run at law to successors, was satisfied only by a landlord-tenant relationship. Keppell v. Bailey, 39 Eng. Rep. 1042 (Ch. 1834). This is still true in England today.</p>

<p id="e146b646-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unlike the English courts, American courts did not define privity of estate to include only a landlord-tenant relationship. They permitted, under varying circumstances, covenants to run in favor of and against successor owners. They developed the American <i>real covenant</i>, a promise respecting the use of land that runs with the land <i>at law</i>. The cases on real covenants are in some disarray and are often obscure and disputed, but you will be able to understand the issues and the confusion if you pay close attention to the following analytic model:</p>

<p id="e146dd62-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose that <i>B</i>, owner of Blackacre, has promised <i>A</i>, owner of Whiteacre, that Blackacre shall not be used for industrial purposes. <i>B</i> sells Blackacre to <i>C</i>, and <i>A</i> sells Whiteacre to <i>D. C</i> constructs a factory on Blackacre. <i>D</i> sues <i>C</i> for damages. Will the covenant run to <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>? Let us begin with the diagram shown on the previous page.</p>
<p id="e146dd63-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If <i>A</i>, before any assignment, sues <i>B</i>, <i>A</i> is suing on the contract. There is privity of contract between <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, and the law of contracts governs. No question arises whether a covenant runs. The question whether a covenant runs arises only when a person who is not a party to the covenant is suing or being sued.</p>
<p id="e146dd64-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Note that there are two ends of the covenant: the <i>benefit</i> end, originally held by <i>A</i> and the <i>burdened</i> parcel, originally held by <i>B</i>. The benefited end is analogous to the dominant estate in the law of easements. The burdened end is the servient estate. If <i>A</i> conveys Whiteacre to <i>D</i>, and <i>B</i> still owns Blackacre and constructs the factory, and <i>D</i> sues <i>B</i>, <i>D</i> must allege that the <i>benefit</i> runs to <i>D</i>. The burden remains with <i>B</i>, the original promisor. If <i>B</i> conveys Blackacre to <i>C</i>, who constructs the factory, and <i>A</i>, still owning Whiteacre, sues <i>C</i>, <i>A</i> must allege that the <i>burden</i> runs to <i>C</i>. If, as in the diagram above, both Whiteacre and Blackacre are conveyed to <i>D</i> and <i>C</i> respectively, and <i>D</i> sues <i>C</i>, <i>D</i> must allege that <i>both the burden and the benefit run</i>. It is important to keep in mind whether the running of the benefit or the running of the burden is involved in the case because the test for running of the burden is traditionally more onerous than the test for running of the benefit.</p>
<p id="e1470475-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Note also that in the above diagram we have two types of privity of estate that we shall discuss: (1) <i>horizontal privity</i>, meaning privity of estate between the original covenanting parties; and (2) <i>vertical privity</i>, meaning privity of estate between one of the covenanting parties and a successor in interest. First, let us explore the meaning of horizontal privity.</p>
<p id="e1470476-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Horizontal privity</i></b>. In this country, courts defined privity of estate between landowners to be a successive (grantor-grantee) relationship. Thus, if in our diagram <i>B</i>’s promise had been in a deed conveying Blackacre from <i>A</i> to <i>B</i>, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> would be in privity of estate. Giving privity this meaning allows enforcement of the covenant against successors when the covenant is created in conjunction with the transfer of some other interest in land, for example, a deed conveying a fee simple, but not otherwise.</p>
<p id="e1470477-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The traditional rules are that horizontal privity of estate is required for the <i>burden</i> of a covenant to run at law, but that horizontal privity is not required for the <i>benefit</i> to run. See Restatement of Property §§534, 548 (1944). The policy basis of these rules was to put various obstacles in the way of the burden running at law, but to permit the benefit to run freely. The policy disfavoring the running of the burden has since been widely criticized and has lost favor today because it frustrates the intent of the original parties.</p>
<p id="e1470478-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Vertical privity.</i></b> Traditional doctrine requires vertical privity for both the burden and the benefit of a real covenant to run. Just what does vertical privity mean? It is important to understand at the outset that under the law of real covenants the burden and the benefit run with <i>estates</i> in land, not the land itself. With respect to the vertical privity requirement, this idea implies that the covenant is enforceable by and against remote parties only if those parties have succeeded to the original parties’ estates in the land in question.</p>
<p id="e1470479-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Different standards are required for vertical privity on the burden and benefit sides. On the <i>burden</i> side, the covenant is enforceable only against someone who has succeeded to the same estate as that of the original promisor. See Restatement <span title="537" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-537">p. 537</span>of Property §535 (1944). If the promisor had a fee simple, the party against whom enforcement is sought must have succeeded to that fee simple estate. Hence the burden of a real covenant does not run to—that is, is not enforceable at law against—an adverse possessor because an adverse possessor does not succeed to the original owner’s estate but takes a new title by operation of law.</p>
<p id="e147047a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A more relaxed standard is used for the running of the benefit, however. The promise is enforceable by a person who succeeds to the original promisee’s estate or to a lesser interest carved out of that estate. See Restatement of Property §547 (1944).</p>
<p id="e147047b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to these privity requirements, real covenant law traditionally has recognized several other requirements for the burden and/or the benefit of a covenant to run with the land. We summarize them here.</p>
<p id="e147047c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Intent</i></b>. The original contracting parties must have intended to bind successors to their respective estates. This requirement is satisfied by language in the parties’ agreement such as “<i>A</i>, on behalf of his heirs and assigns, covenants that…” and seldom poses a problem.</p>
<p id="e147047d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>“Touch and concern.”</i></b> The promise must “touch and concern” the affected land. This basically means that the promise must relate in some way to the enjoyment, possession, or use of the affected land rather than being of personal concern to the original contracting parties. Restrictive covenants of the sort encountered in residential developments rather clearly touch and concern. From the perspective of the touch and concern requirement, the most problematic covenants are affirmative covenants, usually involving the payment of money. Simple covenants to pay dues to homeowner associations are today nearly always enforced. Somewhat less certain are more complex monetary obligations to homeowner associations (or common interest communities, as they are also called). For example, in Streams Sports Club, Ltd. v. Richmond, 457 N.E.2d 1226 (Ill. 1983), the court held that a covenant requiring condominium owners to become dues-paying members of an adjacent sports club that the developer owned (and later sold to Streams Sports) touched and concerned the land because the owners had the right to enjoy the club facilities. However, in Midsouth Golf, LLC v. Fairfield Harbourside Condominium Assn., Inc., 652 S.E.2d 378 (N.C. App. 2007), the court held that a condominium association’s recreational amenity fees covenant did not touch and concern the owners’ properties.</p>
<p id="e147047e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Notice</i></b>. Notice of the covenant is, strictly speaking, not required for the covenant to be valid. But the covenant may not be enforceable against one who lacks notice, either actual, record, or inquiry notice.</p>
<p id="e147047f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A real covenant can be a <i>negative</i> promise (a promise not to do an act) or an <i>affirmative</i> promise (a promise to do an act). A covenant is not enforceable against an assignee who has no notice of it.</p>

Here there is no question about the contract: the owner of certain houses in the square sells the land adjoining, with a covenant from the purchaser not to use it for any other purpose than as a square garden. And it is now contended, not that the vendee could violate the contract, but that he might sell the piece of land, and that the purchaser from him may violate it without this Court having any power to interfere. If that were so, it would be impossible for an owner of land to sell part of it without incurring the risk of rendering what he retains worthless. It is said that, the covenant being one which does not run with the land, this court cannot enforce it; but the question is, not whether the covenant runs with the land, but whether a party shall be permitted to use the land in a manner inconsistent with the contract entered into by his vendor, and with notice of which he purchased. Of course, the price would be affected by the covenant, and nothing could be more inequitable than the original purchaser should be able to sell the property the next day for a greater price, in consideration of the assignee being allowed to escape from the liability which he had himself undertaken.</p>

<p id="e147a0ef-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The fascinating story behind Tulk v. Moxhay and the history of Leicester Square is told in James Charles Smith, Tulk v. Moxhay: The Fight to Develop Leicester Square, in Property Stories 171 (Gerald Korngold &amp; Andrew P. Morriss eds. 2d ed. 2009). Professor Smith reports that the origin of the central restriction involved in the case was not the 1808 deed from Tulk to Elms but a certificate of partition executed earlier in 1789. The land of which the garden was a part was partitioned to pay the original owner’s mortgagees. The court imposed the restrictions to protect land that the mortgagees acquired near the garden. Professor Smith speculates that had Moxhay’s lawyers considered this fact they might have challenged Tulk’s standing. Tulk owned none of the benefited land and hence was not an intended beneficiary of the judicial restriction. Id. at 178 n.24.</p>
<p id="e147a0f0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the time of Tulk v. Moxhay, Leicester Square was changing from a residential to a commercial area, and the central garden had become an unkempt receptacle for rubbish. In 1851, James Wyld, a geographer, purchased the garden from Moxhay’s widow. With the consent of the Tulk family, who received an option to purchase an undivided half of the <span title="542" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-542">p. 542</span>garden at the end of 10 years, Wyld erected in the garden a building to house a 60-foot high plaster scale model of the earth. This building, called “Wyld’s Monster Globe,” dwarfed the surrounding houses. After 10 years this was pulled down, and John A. Tulk, grandson of the plaintiff in Tulk v. Moxhay, exercised the option to purchase. John A. Tulk hoped to convert the garden to building land, as Moxhay had tried to do formerly. After much public outcry, the garden was acquired by the government for a public park in 1874. Leicester Square today is the center of London’s cinema district.</p>

<p id="e1481645-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Is it a real covenant or an equitable servitude?</i></b> Students (and even some courts) are often confused about the distinction between real covenants and equitable servitudes. Given the different requirements for each under traditional doctrine, how does one know whether a covenant should be treated as one or the other? The simple answer is the remedy that the plaintiff is seeking—the traditional difference between real covenants and equitable servitudes relates to the remedy sought. The remedy for breach of a real covenant is damages in a suit at law. The remedy for breach of an equitable servitude is an injunction or enforcement of a lien in a suit in equity.</p>
<p id="e1481646-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To see this, consider again Problem 1 on page 538: <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, neighboring landowners, decide that they will mutually restrict their lots to single-family residential use. They sign an agreement wherein each promises on behalf of herself, and her heirs and assigns, that her lot will be used for single-family residential purposes only. This agreement is recorded in the county courthouse under the name of each signer. <i>B</i> sells her lot to <i>C. C</i> builds an apartment house on his lot. Suppose instead of seeking damages, <i>A</i> seeks an injunction against <i>C.</i> Would the result be the same as if <i>A</i> sought damages?</p>
<p id="e1481647-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If you were the plaintiff in a case like this, would you rather have an injunction or damages? In the large majority of cases, the plaintiff seeks an injunction to enforce the covenant. Part of the reason is that if an injunction is granted, the plaintiff can, if the plaintiff wishes, “sell the injunction” to the defendant, as happened in Tulk v. Moxhay. By fixing the selling price of the injunction, the plaintiff can make his own determination of the amount of damages, whereas if the plaintiff sues for damages the jury determines the amount of damages.</p>
<p id="e1481648-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>The Statute of Frauds and implying equitable servitudes from a common plan.</i></b> A real covenant is an interest in land within the meaning of the Statute of Frauds and must be created by a written instrument signed by the covenantor. If the deed creating a real covenant is signed by the grantor only, and it contains a promise by the grantee, the promise is enforceable against the grantee. The grantee is bound by the act of accepting such a deed. A real covenant cannot arise by estoppel, implication, or prescription, as can an easement.</p>
<p id="e1481649-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, an equitable servitude is an interest in land. But unlike a real covenant, it may be implied in equity under certain limited circumstances. An equitable servitude, which arises out of a promise, cannot be obtained by prescription.</p>
<p id="e148164a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite the Statute of Frauds, most courts have been willing to imply an equitable servitude where a developer of a residential subdivision has manifested a <i>common plan</i> or <i>common scheme</i> of restrictive servitudes throughout the development. The leading case is Sanborn v. McLean, 206 N.W.2d 496 (Mich. 1925), <span title="544" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-544">p. 544</span>where the developers, intending to subject all 91 lots in their development to uniform servitudes restricting the lots to residential use, included express language to that effect in only 53 of the deeds. Some years later, the defendant purchased an apparently unrestricted lot and began to build a gas station in his back yard. The plaintiff and other restricted lot owners sued to enjoin the construction, and the court granted the injunction. The court held that an equitable servitude, which it misleadingly termed a “reciprocal negative easement,” will be implied because the developer had a common plan to develop a residential subdivision. The evidence of this plan included sales literature, statements of the developer, but above all, the fact that 53 out of 91 lots were expressly restricted.</p>
<p id="e148164b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A few jurisdictions take the Statute of Frauds more seriously. In California, an equitable servitude must be created by a written instrument identifying the burdened lot; it will not be implied from the existence of restrictions on other lots in a subdivision. Riley v. Bear Creek Planning Comm., 551 P.2d 1213 (Cal. 1976). In Massachusetts, covenants will not be implied from a general plan, but if the covenants on the burdened lot are in writing a general plan may be used to show that the neighbors in the subdivision were intended as beneficiaries and may enforce the covenants. Snow v. Van Dam, 197 N.E. 224 (Mass. 1935).</p>

<p id="e148164e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Restatement (Third) of Property, Servitudes (2000), purports to modernize and rationalize the law of servitudes. The Restatement takes the position that there is, and ought to be, no difference in the rules applicable to real covenants and equitable servitudes. The Restatement drops the terms “real covenant” and “equitable servitude” and refers to these as covenants running with the land. Id. §1.4. The same rules apply to all covenants running with the land. The court may enforce the covenant by “any appropriate remedy or combination of remedies, which may include declaratory judgment, compensatory damages, punitive damages, nominal damages, injunctions, restitution, and imposition of liens.” Id. §8.3. Moreover, the Restatement applies the same rules to easements and covenants (lumped together as servitudes), unless there is a sound reason for differentiation. For a summary of the irrational distinctions plaguing the old law of servitudes, see Susan F. French, Toward a Modern Law of Servitudes: Reweaving the Ancient Strands, 55 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1261 (1982); Uriel Reichman, Toward a Unified Concept of Servitudes, id. at 1179 (1982).</p>
<p id="e148164f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Restatement (Third) takes the position that horizontal privity of estate is not required for a covenant to run at law to successors. This reflects the modern trend, but the requirement of horizontal privity has not entirely disappeared. See, e.g., Runyon v. Paley, 416 S.E.2d 177 (N.C. 1992); Peters v. Nelson, 730 N.E.2d 1011 (Ohio App. 1999). The Restatement further provides that vertical privity is never required for <i>negative</i> promises and is required for <i>affirmative</i> promises only in limited circumstances. Finally, the Restatement abandons the old “touch and concern” requirement in favor of a default rule that a covenant is initially valid. The bases for holding that a covenant is invalid at its inception are that it is “illegal or unconstitutional or [against] public policy.” Grounds for finding a violation <span title="545" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-545">p. 545</span>of public policy include spiteful or capricious servitudes; servitudes burdening a “fundamental constitutional right” or those imposing an unreasonable restraint on alienation. Restatement (Third) of Property, supra, §3.1.</p>
<p id="e1481650-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Restatement distinguishes between invalidity at the inception of the covenant and subsequent invalidity due to changes of circumstances. The Restatement’s primary concern is with open-ended affirmative covenants, especially those imposing financial obligations. It takes the position that the real problem with such covenants is not their initial validity, but their subsequent validity. Covenants imposing monetary obligations may become objectionable over time as circumstances change, in the Restatement’s view. Hence the problem is one of modification and termination. The Restatement lays down special rules for terminating or modifying such affirmative covenants.</p>
<p id="e1483c61-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As we will see in the next part (see pages 546-550), under the law of covenants and equitable servitudes, it has long been the case that courts may modify or even terminate real covenants and equitable servitudes on the basis of changed conditions. The traditional law of easements, however, does not recognize a changed conditions doctrine. Traditional easements doctrine has dealt with obsolete easements on the basis of what is in effect a frustration of purpose doctrine. See Restatement (Third) of Property, Servitudes §7.10 Reporter’s Note (2000). However, the Restatement provides that the changed conditions doctrine applies to all types of servitudes. See Restatement (Third) of Property, Servitudes §7.10(1) (2000). Under that provision a court may modify or, if modification is not feasible or is ineffective, terminate a servitude if a post-creation change of circumstances has made it practically impossible to accomplish the purpose for which the servitude was created.</p>

<p id="e1483c64-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Covenants, like easements, can be terminated in a number of ways. They may be discharged by: (1) <i>merger</i> on the basis of unity of ownership of the benefit and burden by the same person; (2) a formal <i>release</i>, which is normally written and recorded; (3) <i>acquiescence</i>, which arises when the plaintiff has failed to enforce the servitude against other breaches and then seeks to enforce the servitude against the defendant; (4) <i>abandonment</i>, which resembles acquiescence except that it makes the servitude unenforceable as to the entire parcel rather than only as to the plaintiff immediately involved; (5) the equitable doctrine of <i>unclean hands</i>, according to which the court will refuse to enjoin a violation of a servitude that the plaintiff previously violated; (6) the equitable doctrine of <i>laches</i>, which involves an unreasonable delay by the plaintiff to enforce a servitude against the defendant causing prejudice to the defendant (laches does not extinguish the servitude but only bars enforcement); and (7) <i>estoppel</i>, if the defendant has relied upon the plaintiff’s conduct, making it inequitable to allow the plaintiff to enforce the servitude. See Powell on Real Property §60.10[1] (Michael A. Wolf gen. ed. 2009). Servitudes may also be terminated through the exercise of the government’s eminent domain power (discussed on page 532) and on the basis of prescription.</p>

<p id="e1483c6d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a bill of complaint for declaratory judgment, Alice Batten and other owners of lots in the Carrsbrook Subdivision in Albemarle County (collectively, Batten) sought a declaration favoring the enforceability of restrictive covenants prohibiting commercial use of four unimproved lots in the same subdivision, namely, Lots 1, 2C, and 2D in Section C and Lot 1 in Section E. River Heights Associates Limited Partnership is the record owner of Lot 1, Section C, which it acquired in 1998, S.V. Associates is the record owner of Lots 2C and 2D, Section C, which it acquired in 1978, and First Gold Leaf Land Trust is the record owner of Lot 1, Section E, which it acquired in 1986. Batten named these record owners as the defendants in her bill of complaint.</p>
<p id="e148637e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the entities just listed hold title to the four lots in question, the briefs describe Wendell W. Wood and his wife, Marlene C. Wood, as the beneficial owners of the lots. While the Woods were not named as defendants below and are not parties to this appeal, the appellants in the case are referred to collectively in the briefs as “Wood,” and we will follow the same practice.</p>
<p id="e148637f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Wood demurred to the bill of complaint on the grounds, inter alia, that Batten had failed to state a cause of action upon which relief could be granted and had failed to allege the existence of a controversy pursuant to Code §8.01-184, a part of the declaratory judgment statutes, so as to confer jurisdiction over the claims asserted in the bill of complaint. The trial court overruled the demurrer on these grounds but sustained it on other grounds not pertinent here and allowed Batten to file an amended bill of complaint.</p>
<p id="e1486380-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Batten filed an amended bill not differing in substance from her original bill. Wood filed an answer to the amended bill in which he denied the essential elements of Batten’s claim for relief. In a section styled “Affirmative Defenses,” Wood contended that Batten had failed to state a cause of action upon which relief could be granted, that the restrictive covenant was unenforceable, and that the covenant did not apply to his property. Wood also contended that he had no knowledge of the covenant.</p>
<p id="e1486381-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>Evidentiary Background</b></p>
<p id="e1486382-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Carrsbrook Subdivision is located on the eastern side of U.S. Route 29 between the northern city limits of Charlottesville and the Rivanna River. The four lots here in dispute are located at the western edge of the subdivision and are the only lots with frontage on U.S. Route 29.</p>
<p id="e1486383-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The restrictive covenants were established in a deed dated May 6, 1959, from Norman Kelsey and wife to Charles W. Hurt (the Kelsey-Hurt deed), which conveyed an unsubdivided 40-acre portion of “the land known as ‘Carrsbrook.’ ” The conveyance was made subject to “certain restrictions…which shall be considered as covenants running with the land.” Only one of the restrictions is pertinent here: “The property is to be used for residential purposes only and no rooming house, boarding house, tourist home, or any other type of commercial enterprise, or any church, hospital, asylum, or charitable institution shall be operated thereon” (the restrictive covenant).</p>

<p id="e1488aa6-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In October 1960, Section C of Carrsbrook was subdivided into 19 lots, all made “subject to the restrictive covenants applicable to Carrsbrook Subdivision of record.” [L]ot 1…contain[s] 3.04 acres bordering Carrsbrook Drive, Indian Spring Road, and Route 29. Lot 2…contain[s] 2.55 acres bordering Indian Spring Road and Route 29. A notation on the plat states that “[l]ots 1 &amp; 2 restricted to non access on Rte. 29 if lots are used for residential purposes” (the plat note).</p>
<p id="e1488aa7-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1962, Lot 2, Section C, was resubdivided into four lots, namely, 2A, 2B, 2C, and 2D. Lots 2C and 2D border Route 29. Lots 2A and 2B border only Indian Spring Road, leaving Lots 2C and 2D without direct access to the residential roads in the subdivision and Lots 2A and 2B without direct access to Route 29. In addition, Lots 2C and 2D, along with Lot 1C, are subject to the plat note.</p>
<p id="e148b1b8-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1969, Albemarle County adopted its first comprehensive zoning ordinance. The lots in question were zoned to a depth of 200 feet from Route 29 in a B-1 classification, a commercial district in which residential use is prohibited. This zoning classification was continued in a comprehensive rezoning in 1980, with the result that presently the lots in question are zoned for commercial use but are subject to the restrictive covenant prohibiting such use.</p>
<p id="e148b1b9-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When Carrsbrook Subdivision was created in 1969, Route 29 was a two-lane road with residences and small businesses located on each side of the road. In the area where the lots in question are located, Route 29 is today an eight- to ten-lane road that is highly developed commercially on both sides with shopping centers, hotels, restaurants, automobile dealerships, and other types of businesses. No residential uses have been implemented along Route 29 since 1959. There have been no changes within the Carrsbrook Subdivision other than the aging of homes and the maturing of trees.</p>

Further, Wood also stresses the fact that “no residential houses have been built or used from <span title="549" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-549">p. 549</span>the city limits of Charlottesville to the South Rivanna River on either the east or west side of Route 29 in the last thirty years.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1138B_5eaa6106-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1138B_5eaa6106-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">10</a></span></p>
<p id="e148b1c0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The test for determining whether changed conditions warrant the nullification of a restrictive covenant was enunciated in Deitrick v. Leadbetter, 175 Va. 170, 8 S.E.2d 276 (1940), as follows:</p>

<p id="e148b1c3-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Wood takes the trial court to task, saying that the court “ignored the radical changes that have occurred in and around the subject properties since 1959, but rather focused myopically on whether or not there have been changes within the interior of the Subdivision.” This is an unfair representation of what the trial court ruled in this case.</p>
<p id="e148b1c4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a letter opinion, the trial court wrote: “[Wood has] failed to prove that radical changes both in and around the neighborhood have occurred such that the purpose of the restrictive covenant is destroyed.” (Emphasis added.) Thus, it is clear the court did not focus upon conditions in Carrsbrook Subdivision alone but on conditions “around the neighborhood” as a whole.</p>
<p id="e148b1c5-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is in accord with Virginia law. In Booker [v. Old Dominion Land Co., 49 S.E.2d 314 (Va. 1948)], relief was sought from a restrictive covenant prohibiting commercial uses of residential lots in a subdivision. It was alleged that there had been a change of conditions so radical as to destroy the essential objectives and purposes of the covenant. These changes included the operation of a nearby zipper factory, the conversion of one of the lots into a hard-surfaced road leading to the factory, the widening of the road on which all the lots abutted from a two-lane roadway, carrying a small amount of traffic, to a heavily traveled four-lane federal highway, the construction nearby of a large shopping center, and the presence of a skating rink across the road from one of the lots.</p>
<p id="e148b1c6-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court refused to remove the restrictive covenant. This Court affirmed. We said that “if a radical change takes place in the whole neighborhood so as to defeat the purpose of the restrictions and render their enforcement inequitable and oppressive, equity will not compel observance of them by injunction.” <i>Id</i>. at 317. (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p id="e148b1c7-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Wood seemingly would have the rule the other way—ignore the circumstances within the property protected by a restrictive covenant and focus only upon the surrounding area. However, common sense tells us that when the issue is whether a restrictive covenant still serves its intended purpose and that purpose is to protect the lots in a particular subdivision from commercial uses, the conditions existing within the subdivision must be examined along with those existing in the surrounding area in order to determine the issue fairly. To ignore the conditions within the subdivision and <span title="550" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-550">p. 550</span>to hold the covenant unenforceable solely because of changed conditions elsewhere would deny the lot owners the protection to which they are entitled according to a solemn covenant voluntarily made, and that would be grossly unfair.</p>
<p id="e148d8d8-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What is required, therefore, is a leveling exercise in which fair consideration is given both to conditions in the subdivision and those in the surrounding area. Here, the facts are that there have been no changes within Carrsbrook Subdivision other than the aging of homes and the maturing of trees but there have been substantial changes within the surrounding area. After giving fair consideration to both situations, we are of opinion the changes are not so radical as to defeat the purpose of the covenant.…</p>

<p id="e148d8dd-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>The changed conditions doctrine.</i></b> The changed conditions doctrine, of which <i>River Heights Associates</i> is a typical example, is a stringent one. As long as the restriction is of value to some land, courts usually will not terminate it, even though conditions have changed in such a way that the restriction decreases the value of other land.</p>
<p id="e148d8de-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>The appropriate remedy.</i></b> In most cases, when the court holds that the restriction has not terminated despite changed conditions, it enforces the covenant by injunctive relief. But is that the best remedy? We previously encountered the question whether an injunction or damages is the better remedy and what factors play into this choice of remedy, in Chapter 9, on nuisance. See Notes 3 and 4, at page 481. Generally, a court can enforce a restrictive covenant by an injunction or by an award of damages for breach. Which remedy is preferable, as a matter of fairness and efficiency, when conditions radically change? Should it matter whether multiple parties have the benefit of the covenant? For a searching discussion of this matter, see Glen O. Robinson, Explaining Contingent Rights: The Puzzle of “Obsolete” Covenants, 91 Colum. L. Rev. 546, 548-560, 570-576 (1991).</p>
<p id="e148d8df-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>The Restatement (Third) approach.</i></b> Restatement (Third) of Property, Servitudes §7.10(2), provides: “If the purpose of the servitude can be accomplished, but because of changed conditions the servient estate is no longer suitable for uses permitted by the servitude, a court may modify the servitude to permit other uses under conditions designed to preserve the benefits of the original servitude.” How does this compare with the traditional changed conditions doctrine, illustrated by <i>River Heights Associates</i>? Comment a goes on to state: “Where transaction costs are likely to be high because large numbers of people are involved…a court should be more ready to intervene than where transaction costs are likely to be low.”</p>
<p id="e148d8e0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 7.10 applies to easements as well as to equitable servitudes and real covenants. This represents a major change in the law of easements, which traditionally did not recognize changed conditions as a basis for termination. The extension of the changed conditions doctrine to easements is part of the general objective of the Restatement to unify the law of servitudes.</p>

Here the particular patterns of discrimination and the areas in which the restrictions are to operate, are determined, in the first instance, by the terms of agreements among private individuals. Participation of the State consists in the enforcement of the restrictions so defined. The crucial issue with which we are here confronted is whether this distinction removes these cases from the operation of the prohibitory provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. Since the decision of this Court in the Civil Rights Cases, 1883, 109 U.S. 3, the principle has become firmly embedded in our constitutional law that the action inhibited by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment is only such action as may fairly be said to be that of the States.

Although, in construing the terms of the Fourteenth Amendment, differences have from time to time been expressed as to whether particular types of state action may be said to offend the Amendment’s prohibitory provisions, it has never been suggested that state court action is immunized from the operation of those provisions simply because the act is that of the judicial branch of the state government.</p>

It is clear that but for the active intervention of the state courts, supported by the full panoply of state power, petitioners would have been free to occupy the properties in question without restraint.</p>

Whatever else the framers sought to achieve, it is clear that the matter of primary concern was the establishment of equality in the enjoyment of basic civil and political rights and the preservation of those rights from discriminatory action on the part of the States based on considerations of race or color. Seventy-five years ago this Court announced that the provisions of the Amendment are to be construed with this fundamental purpose in mind.</p>
<p id="e1494e37-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Upon full consideration, we have concluded that in these cases the States have acted to deny petitioners the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.

<p id="e1494e3e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Non-constitutional grounds for decision.</i></b> Could a court have declared the racially restrictive covenant in <i>Shelley</i> not only unenforceable but invalid on any non-constitutional grounds? Did the covenants in that case meet all of the common-law requirements for covenants running with the land? See Rose, supra, at 200-04.</p>
<p id="e149754f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2.</b> <b><i>The signaling function of racial covenants.</i></b> Professors Richard Brooks and Carol Rose have established that with respect to racial covenants, <i>Shelley</i> changed very little. After the decision racial covenants continued to play an important role in perpetuating residential racial segregation in urban areas. They serve as important signals of neighbor racial preferences to real estate brokers and lenders. It was not until 1968, when the federal Fair Housing Act was first enacted, that this signaling function was seriously addressed. See Richard R.W. Brooks &amp; Carol M. Rose, Saving the Neighborhood: Racially Restrictive Covenants, Law, and Social Norms (2013).</p>
<p id="e1497550-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>The Fair Housing Act.</i></b> A covenant with a racially discriminatory effect may violate the federal Fair Housing Act, enacted as Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C.A. §§3601-3631. Recall that the act makes it unlawful to refuse to sell or rent or otherwise make unavailable a dwelling to any person because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, familial status, or handicap. See pages <span title="555" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-555">p. 555</span>288-289. Still, there may be ways around the prohibition. See Lior Jacob Strahilevitz, Information and Exclusion 55-71 (2011) (discussing “exclusionary amenities” and “exclusionary vibes” that circumvent anti-discrimination protection).</p>
<p id="e1497551-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Discrimination against group homes.</i></b> Covenants restricting property to “residential use only” or “single-family residence” have been the subject of considerable litigation. Suppose that a private, not-for-profit corporation that assists mentally impaired persons purchases a house in a residential subdivision all the lots of which are restricted by covenant to “single-family” residences. The corporation plans to use the house as a group home for eight unrelated mentally impaired residents. The homeowner association charged with enforcing all restrictive covenants sues to enjoin such use on the ground that it would violate the restriction.</p>
<p id="e1497552-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The situation poses two questions: (1) Does the use of the house as a group home fall within the meaning of the phrase “single-family residence”? On this question, the cases are mixed. Most courts have found that the intended use is permissible either on the theory that the restriction was intended to regulate an architectural style rather than the relationship among the structure’s inhabitants (see, e.g., Blevins v. Barry-Lawrence County Assn. for Retarded Citizens, 707 S.W.2d 407 (Mo. 1986)), or that “single family” was intended to be interpreted to include groups of otherwise unrelated persons who function as a family. See, e.g., Berger v. State, 364 A.2d 993 (N.J. 1976). (2) Does such a restrictive term violates the federal Fair Housing Act or some other anti-discrimination statute? In Hill v. Community of Damien of Molokai, 911 P.2d 861 (N.M. 1996), the court, after first concluding that a group home for persons with AIDS fell within the meaning of a “single-family residence” covenant, held that the covenant violated §3604(f)(1) of the FHA by discriminating on the basis of handicap. The court held that the covenant would impose no undue hardship on the neighbors and that the neighbors could reasonably accommodate the group home.</p>

<p id="e1497555-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Common interest communities, or CICs for short, are a form of residential ownership in which management of the development is separated from possession. There are three basic types of CICs—condominiums, cooperatives, and planned subdivisions, including gated communities.</p>
<p id="e1497556-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recent decades have witnessed a remarkable growth in the number of CICs. The number of community associations in the United States grew from 10,000 in 1970 and 222,500 in 2000 to 338,000 in 2015. <a target="_blank" href="https://caionline.org/AboutCommunityAssociations/Pages/StatisticalInformation.aspx" class="epub-externalref">https://caionline.org/AboutCommunityAssociations/Pages/StatisticalInformation.aspx</a>.</p>
<p id="e1497557-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Almost every state has adopted a statutory scheme for organizing a CIC. These statutes require a declaration of rules, called covenants, conditions, and restrictions, or CC&amp;Rs for short, governing the community, which must be disclosed to purchasers. In most CICs, a homeowners association, in which all homeowners are automatically members, enforces the servitudes set forth in the declaration establishing the CIC. The association, governed by a board elected by its members, may adopt new regulations reasonably necessary to manage the common property, administer the servitude regime, protect community members from unreasonable interference in the enjoyment of their individual property, and carry out other functions set forth in the declaration establishing the CIC.</p>
<span title="556" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-556">p. 556</span>
<p id="e1497558-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“The distinctive feature of a common-interest community,” declares the Restatement (Third) of Property, Servitudes §6.2 comment a (2000), “is the obligation that binds the owners of individual lots or units to contribute to the support of common property, or other facilities, or to support the activities of an association, whether or not the owner uses the common property or facilities, or agrees to join the association.” Although the rules about servitudes covered earlier in this chapter are generally applicable to CICs, the homeowners association in addition has power to raise any funds reasonably necessary to carry out its functions. In most such communities, the power to levy assessments is enforceable by fines and a lien on the individual property.</p>
<p id="e1497559-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In CICs, any requirement of horizontal or vertical privity is met because the original purchasers are all in privity with the developer and subsequent purchasers are in privity with the original purchasers. Any requirement that a covenant touch and concern the land is usually satisfied. Negative covenants restricting use are almost always held to touch and concern, as are affirmative covenants to pay dues to a homeowners association. But, because the rules of a CIC and the powers of the homeowners association can adversely affect the interests of individual members, courts have been called upon to determine whether individual members shall be protected from imposition by those who control the association. A major issue is by what standards the validity of the CIC’s rules and regulations should be evaluated.</p>

The owner asserted that the restriction, which was contained in the project’s declaration<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1154C_5eaa6106-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1154C_5eaa6106-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">11</a></span> recorded by the condominium project’s developer, was “unreasonable” as applied to her because she kept her three cats indoors and because her cats were “noiseless” and “created no nuisance.” Agreeing with the premise underlying the owner’s complaint, the Court of Appeal concluded that the homeowners association could enforce the restriction only upon proof that plaintiff’s cats would be likely to interfere with the right of other homeowners “to the peaceful and quiet enjoyment of their property.”</p>
<p id="e1499c71-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those of us who have cats or dogs can attest to their wonderful companionship and affection. Not surprisingly, studies have confirmed this effect.…But the issue before us is not whether in the abstract pets can have a beneficial effect on humans. Rather, the narrow issue here is whether a pet restriction that is contained in the recorded declaration of a condominium complex is enforceable against the challenge of a homeowner. As we shall explain, the Legislature, in Civil Code section 1354, has <span title="557" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-557">p. 557</span>required that courts enforce the covenants, conditions and restrictions contained in the recorded declaration of a common interest development “unless unreasonable.”</p>
<p id="e1499c72-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because a stable and predictable living environment is crucial to the success of condominiums and other common interest residential developments, and because recorded use restrictions are a primary means of ensuring this stability and predictability, the Legislature in section 1354 has afforded such restrictions a presumption of validity and has required of challengers that they demonstrate the restriction’s “unreasonableness” by the deferential standard applicable to equitable servitudes. Under this standard established by the Legislature, enforcement of a restriction does not depend upon the conduct of a particular condominium owner. Rather, the restriction must be uniformly enforced in the condominium development to which it was intended to apply unless the plaintiff owner can show that the burdens it imposes on affected properties so substantially outweigh the benefits of the restriction that it should not be enforced against any owner. Here, the Court of Appeal did not apply this standard in deciding that plaintiff had stated a claim for declaratory relief. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal and remand for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>

These ownership arrangements are known as “common interest” developments.</p>
<p id="e149c392-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">…[S]ubordination of individual property rights to the collective judgment of the owners association together with restrictions on the use of real property comprise the chief attributes of owning property in a common interest development. As the Florida District Court of Appeal observed in Hidden Harbour Estates, Inc. v. Norman (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1975) 309 So. 2d 180, a decision frequently cited in condominium cases: “[I]nherent in the condominium concept is the principle that to promote the health, happiness, and peace of mind of the majority of the unit owners since they are living in such close proximity and using facilities in common, each unit owner must give up a certain degree of freedom of choice which he [or she] might otherwise enjoy in separate, privately owned property. Condominium unit owners comprise a little democratic sub-society of necessity more restrictive as it pertains to use of condominium property than may be existent outside the condominium organization.”</p>
<p id="e149c393-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One significant factor in the continued popularity of the common interest form of property ownership is the ability of homeowners to enforce restrictive CC&amp;R’s against other owners (including future purchasers) of project units. (Natelson, Law of Property Owners Associations 1989 §1.3.2.1, p. 19…) Generally, however, such enforcement is possible only if the restriction that is sought to be enforced meets the requirements of equitable servitudes or of covenants running with the land.…</p>
<p id="e149c394-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When restrictions limiting the use of property within a common interest development satisfy the requirements of covenants running with the land or of equitable <span title="559" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-559">p. 559</span>servitudes, what standard or test governs their enforceability? In California, as we explained at the outset, our Legislature has made common interest development use restrictions contained in a project’s recorded declaration “enforceable…unless unreasonable.” (Civil Code, §1354, subd. (a).)</p>
<p id="e149c395-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In states lacking such legislative guidance, some courts have adopted a standard under which a common interest development’s recorded use restrictions will be enforced so long as they are “reasonable.” (See Riley v. Stoves (1974) 22 Ariz. App. 223, 228, 526 P.2d 747, 752 [asking whether the challenged restriction provided “a reasonable means to accomplish the private objective”].)…Others would limit the “reasonableness” standard only to those restrictions adopted by majority vote of the homeowners or enacted under the rulemaking power of an association’s governing board, and would not apply this test to restrictions included in a planned development project’s recorded declaration or master deed. Because such restrictions are presumptively valid, these authorities would enforce them regardless of reasonableness. The first court to articulate this view was the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal.</p>
<p id="e149c396-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Hidden Harbour Estates v. Basso (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1981) 393 So. 2d 637, the Florida court distinguished two categories of use restrictions: use restrictions set forth in the declaration or master deed of the condominium project itself, and rules promulgated by the governing board of the condominium owners association or the board’s interpretation of a rule. The latter category of use restrictions, the court said, should be subject to a “reasonableness” test, so as to “somewhat fetter the discretion of the board of directors.” Such a standard, the court explained, best assures that governing boards will “enact rules and make decisions that are reasonably related to the promotion of the health, happiness and peace of mind” of the project owners, considered collectively.</p>
<p id="e149c397-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By contrast, restrictions contained in the declaration or master deed of the condominium complex, the Florida court concluded, should not be evaluated under a “reasonableness” standard. Rather, such use restrictions are “clothed with a very strong presumption of validity” and should be upheld even if they exhibit some degree of unreasonableness. Nonenforcement would be proper only if such restrictions were arbitrary or in violation of public policy or some fundamental constitutional right. The Florida court’s decision was cited with approval recently by a Massachusetts appellate court in Noble v. Murphy (1993) 34 Mass. App. Ct. 452, 612 N.E.2d 266.</p>
<p id="e149c398-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Noble</i>, managers of a condominium development sought to enforce against the owners of one unit a pet restriction contained in the project’s master deed. The Massachusetts court upheld the validity of the restriction. The court stated that “[a] condominium use restriction appearing in originating documents which predate the purchase of individual units” was entitled to greater judicial deference than restrictions “promulgated after units have been individually acquired.” The court reasoned that “properly-enacted and evenly-enforced use restrictions contained in a master deed or original bylaws of a condominium” should be insulated against attack “except on constitutional or public policy grounds.” This standard, the court explained, best “serves the interest of the majority of owners [within a project] who may be presumed to have chosen not to alter or rescind such restrictions,” and it spares overcrowded courts “the burden and expense of highly particularized and lengthy litigation.”</p>
<p id="e149eaa9-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Indeed, giving deference to use restrictions contained in a condominium project’s originating documents protects the general expectations of condominium owners “that restrictions in place at the time they purchase their units will be enforceable.” <span title="560" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-560">p. 560</span>(Note, Judicial Review of Condominium Rulemaking (1981) 94 Harv.

Rev. 1519, 1526-1527 [stating that association members “unanimously consent to the provisions in the association’s original documents” and courts therefore should not scrutinize such documents for “reasonableness”].) This in turn encourages the development of shared ownership housing—generally a less costly alternative to single-dwelling ownership—by attracting buyers who prefer a stable, planned environment. It also protects buyers who have paid a premium for condominium units in reliance on a particular restrictive scheme.</p>

<p id="e149eaab-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">…Thus, when enforcing equitable servitudes, courts are generally disinclined to question the wisdom of agreed-to restrictions.…This rule does not apply, however, when the restriction does not comport with public policy. Equity will not enforce any restrictive covenant that violates public policy. (See Shelley v. Kraemer (1948) 334 U.S. 1, 68 S. Ct. 836, 92 L. Ed. 1161 [racial restriction unenforceable]; §53, subd. (b) [voiding property use restrictions based on “sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, or disability”].) Nor will courts enforce as equitable servitudes those restrictions that are arbitrary, that is, bearing no rational relationship to the protection, preservation, operation or purpose of the affected land. (See Laguna Royale Owners Assn. v. Darger (1981) 119 Cal. App. 3d 670, 684, 174 Cal. Rptr. 136.)</p>
<p id="e149eaac-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These limitations on the equitable enforcement of restrictive servitudes that are either arbitrary or violate fundamental public policy are specific applications of the general rule that courts will not enforce a restrictive covenant when “the harm caused by the restriction is so disproportionate to the benefit produced” by its enforcement that the restriction “ought not to be enforced.” (Rest., Property, §539, com. f, pp. 3229-3230.) When a use restriction bears no relationship to the land it burdens, or violates a fundamental policy inuring to the public at large, the resulting harm will always be disproportionate to any benefit.…</p>
<p id="e149eaad-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With these principles of equitable servitude law to guide us, we now turn to Civil Code section 1354. As mentioned earlier, under subdivision (a) of section 1354 the use restrictions for a common interest development that are set forth in the recorded declaration are “enforceable equitable servitudes, unless unreasonable.” In other words, such restrictions should be enforced unless they are wholly arbitrary, violate a fundamental public policy, or impose a burden on the use of affected land that far outweighs any benefit.</p>
<p id="e149eaae-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This interpretation of section 1354 is consistent with the views of legal commentators as well as judicial decisions in other jurisdictions that have applied a presumption of validity to the recorded land use restrictions of a common interest development. (Noble v. Murphy, supra, 612 N.E.2d 266, 270; Hidden Harbour Estates v. Basso, supra, 393 So. 2d 637, 639-640; Note, Judicial Review of Condominium Rulemaking, supra, 94 Harv. L. Rev. 647, 653.) As these authorities point out, and as we discussed previously, recorded CC&amp;R’s are the primary means of achieving the stability and predictability so essential to the success of a shared ownership housing development.…</p>
<p id="e149eaaf-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When courts accord a presumption of validity to all such recorded use restrictions and measure them against deferential standards of equitable servitude law, it discourages lawsuits by owners of individual units seeking personal exemptions from the restrictions. This also promotes stability and predictability in two ways. It provides <span title="561" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-561">p. 561</span>substantial assurance to prospective condominium purchasers that they may rely with confidence on the promises embodied in the project’s recorded CC&amp;R’s. And it protects all owners in the planned development from unanticipated increases in association fees to fund the defense of legal challenges to recorded restrictions.</p>
<p id="e149eab0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How courts enforce recorded use restrictions affects not only those who have made their homes in planned developments, but also the owners associations charged with the fiduciary obligation to enforce those restrictions. (See Posey v. Leavitt (1991) 229 Cal. App. 3d 1236, 1247, 280 Cal. Rptr. 568; Advising Cal. Condominium and Homeowner Associations (Cont. Ed. Bar 1991) §6.11, pp. 259-261.) When courts treat recorded use restrictions as presumptively valid, and place on the challenger the burden of proving the restriction “unreasonable” under the deferential standards applicable to equitable servitudes, associations can proceed to enforce reasonable restrictive covenants without fear that their actions will embroil them in costly and prolonged legal proceedings. Of course, when an association determines that a unit owner has violated a use restriction, the association must do so in good faith, not in an arbitrary or capricious manner, and its enforcement procedures must be fair and applied uniformly.…</p>
<p id="e149eab1-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is an additional beneficiary of legal rules that are protective of recorded use restrictions: the judicial system. Fewer lawsuits challenging such restrictions will be brought, and those that are filed may be disposed of more expeditiously, if the rules courts use in evaluating such restrictions are clear, simple, and not subject to exceptions based on the peculiar circumstances or hardships of individual residents in condominiums and other shared-ownership developments.</p>
<p id="e149eab2-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Contrary to the dissent’s accusations that the majority’s decision “fray[s]” the “social fabric,” we are of the view that our social fabric is best preserved if courts uphold and enforce solemn written instruments that embody the expectations of the parties rather than treat them as “worthless paper” as the dissent would. Our social fabric is founded on the stability of expectation and obligation that arises from the consistent enforcement of the terms of deeds, contracts, wills, statutes, and other writings. To allow one person to escape obligations under a written instrument upsets the expectations of all the other parties governed by that instrument (here, the owners of the other 529 units) that the instrument will be uniformly and predictably enforced.…</p>
<p id="e149eab3-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Refusing to enforce the CC&amp;R’s contained in a recorded declaration, or enforcing them only after protracted litigation that would require justification of their application on a case-by-case basis, would impose great strain on the social fabric of the common interest development. It would frustrate owners who had purchased their units in reliance on the CC&amp;R’s. It would put the owners and the homeowners association in the difficult and divisive position of deciding whether particular CC&amp;R’s should be applied to a particular owner. Here, for example, deciding whether a particular animal is “confined to an owner’s unit and create[s] no noise, odor, or nuisance” is a fact-intensive determination that can only be made by examining in detail the behavior of the particular animal and the behavior of the particular owner. Homeowners associations are ill-equipped to make such investigations, and any decision they might make in a particular case could be divisive or subject to claims of partiality.</p>
<p id="e149eab4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Enforcing the CC&amp;R’s contained in a recorded declaration only after protracted case-by-case litigation would impose substantial litigation costs on the owners through their homeowners association, which would have to defend not only against owners contesting the application of the CC&amp;R’s to them, but also against owners contesting any case-by-case exceptions the homeowners association might make. In short, it is <span title="562" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-562">p. 562</span>difficult to imagine what could more disrupt the harmony of a common interest development than the course proposed by the dissent.</p>

<p id="e149eab6-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, the Court of Appeal failed to consider the rules governing equitable servitudes in holding that Nahrstedt’s complaint challenging the Lakeside Village restriction against the keeping of cats in condominium units stated a cause of action for declaratory relief. Instead, the court concluded that factual allegations by Nahrstedt that her cats are kept inside her condominium unit and do not bother her neighbors were sufficient to have the trial court decide whether enforcement of the restriction against Nahrstedt would be reasonable. For this conclusion, the court relied on two Court of Appeal decisions, Bernardo Villas Management Corp. v. Black (1987) 190 Cal. App. 3d 153, 235 Cal. Rptr. 509 and Portola Hills Community Assn. v. James (1992) 4 Cal. App. 4th 289, 5 Cal. Rptr. 2d 580, both of which had invalidated recorded restrictions covered by section 1354.</p>
<p id="e149eab7-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Bernardo Villas</i>, the manager of a condominium project sued two condominium residents to enforce a restriction that prohibited them from keeping any “truck, camper, trailer, boat…or other form of recreational vehicle” in the carports. In holding that the restriction was unreasonable as applied to the clean new pickup truck with camper shell that the defendants used for personal transportation, the Court of Appeal observed that parking the truck in the development’s carport would “not interfere with other owners’ use or enjoyment of their property.”</p>
<p id="e149eab8-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thereafter, a different division of the same district Court of Appeal used a similar analysis in <i>Portola Hills.</i> There, the court refused to enforce a planned community’s landscape restriction banning satellite dishes against a homeowner who had installed a satellite dish in his backyard. After expressing the view that “[a] homeowner is allowed to prove a particular restriction is unreasonable as applied to his property,” the court observed that the defendant’s satellite dish was not visible to other project residents or the public, leading the court to conclude that the ban promoted no legitimate goal of the homeowners association.</p>
<p id="e14a11c9-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At issue in both Bernardo Villas Management Corp. v. Black, supra, 190 Cal. App. 3d 153, 235 Cal. Rptr. 509, and Portola Hills Community Assn. v. James, supra, 4 Cal. App. 4th 289, 5 Cal. Rptr. 2d 580, were recorded use restrictions contained in a common interest development’s declaration that had been recorded with the county recorder. Accordingly, the use restrictions involved in these two cases were covered by section 1354, rendering them presumptively reasonable and enforceable under the rules governing equitable servitudes.…In determining whether a restriction is “unreasonable” under section 1354, and thus not enforceable, the focus is on the restriction’s effect on the project as a whole, not on the individual homeowner. Although purporting to evaluate the use restrictions in accord with section 1354, both <i>Bernardo Villas</i> and <i>Portola Hills</i> failed to apply the deferential standards of equitable servitude law just mentioned. Accordingly, to the extent they differ from the views expressed in this opinion, we disapprove <i>Bernardo Villas</i> and <i>Portola Hills.</i></p>

<p id="e14a11d5-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I find the provision known as the “pet restriction” contained in the covenants, conditions, and restrictions (CC&amp;R’s) governing the Lakeside Village project patently arbitrary and unreasonable within the meaning of Civil Code section 1354. Beyond dispute, human beings have long enjoyed an abiding and cherished association with their household animals. Given the substantial benefits derived from pet ownership, the undue burden on the use of property imposed on condominium owners who can maintain pets within the confines of their units without creating a nuisance or disturbing the quiet enjoyment of others substantially outweighs whatever meager utility the restriction may serve in the abstract. It certainly does not promote “health, happiness [or] peace of mind” commensurate with its tariff on the quality of life for those who value the companionship of animals. Worse, it contributes to the fraying of our social fabric.…</p>

<p id="e14a11d9-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From the statement of the facts through the conclusion, the majority’s analysis…simply takes refuge behind the “presumption of validity” now accorded all CC&amp;R’s irrespective of subject matter. They never objectively scrutinize defendants’ blandishments of protecting “health and happiness” or realistically assess the substantial impact on affected unit owners and their use of their property.…</p>
<p id="e14a38ea-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, such inquiry should start with an evaluation of the interest that will suffer upon enforcement of the pet restriction. In determining the “burden on the use of land,” due recognition must be given to the fact that this particular “use” transcends the impersonal and mundane matters typically regulated by condominium CC&amp;R’s, such as whether someone can place a doormat in the hallway or hang a towel on the patio rail or have food in the pool area, and reaches the very quality of life of hundreds of owners and residents. Nonetheless, the majority accept uncritically the proffered justification of preserving “health and happiness” and essentially consider only one criterion to determine enforceability: was the restriction recorded in the original declaration? If so, it is “presumptively valid,” unless in violation of public policy.</p>
<p id="e14a38eb-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given the application of the law to the facts alleged and by an inversion of relative interests, it is difficult to hypothesize any CC&amp;R’s that would not pass muster. Such sanctity has not been afforded any writing save the commandments delivered to Moses on Mount Sinai, and they were set in stone, not upon worthless paper.</p>
<p id="e14a38ec-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, unlike most conduct controlled by CC&amp;R’s, the activity at issue here is strictly confined to the owner’s interior space; it does not in any manner invade other units or the common areas. Owning a home of one’s own has always epitomized the American dream. More than simply embodying the notion of having “one’s castle,” it represents the sense of freedom and self-determination emblematic of our national character. Granted, those who live in multi-unit developments cannot exercise this freedom to the same extent possible on a large estate. But owning pets that do not disturb the quiet enjoyment of others does not reasonably come within this compromise. <span title="565" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-565">p. 565</span>Nevertheless, with no demonstrated or discernible benefit, the majority arbitrarily sacrifice the dream to the tyranny of the “commonality.”</p>

<p id="e14a38f1-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After losing the lawsuit, Natore (who pronounced her name “Nature”) Nahrstedt moved out of Lakeside Village, with her three cats, Boo-Boo, Dockers, and Tulip. Her legal bill was around $50,000. She commented, “I’m disappointed in their decision, but that doesn’t mean that I’m not going to campaign to have it overturned by the Legislature.” Condo Cat Fight Has Some Purring, Others Fleeing, available at http://articles.latimes.com/1994-09-04/local/me-34732_1_condo-cat. However, even without her lobbying efforts, the California legislature subsequently overturned the <i>Nahrstedt</i> decision in 2000, enacting Cal. Civ. Code §1360.5. It states: “(a) No governing documents shall prohibit the owner of a separate interest within a common interest development from keeping at least one pet [defined as ‘any domesticated bird, cat, dog, aquatic animal kept within an aquarium, or other animal as agreed to between the association and the homeowner’] within the common interest development, subject to reasonable rules and regulations of the association.” Ms. Nahrstedt died on November 29, 2007.</p>

<p id="e14a38f4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>The court’s reasonableness standard.</i></b> The court’s reasonableness standard appears to give a presumption of validity to a restriction in the master declaration unless the restriction produces a result that is completely irrational for everyone in the CIC. Is this an accurate interpretation of the language of the California statute, which basically says that restrictions are valid and enforceable “unless unreasonable”? Or does the dissent have the better of the argument?</p>
<p id="e14a38f5-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>The Restatement (Third) standard.</i></b> Rather than adopting a general reasonableness standard, as in <i>Nahrstedt</i>, Restatement (Third) of Property, Servitudes §3.1 (2000) (see page 545) establishes a presumption that a servitude is valid unless it is “illegal, unconstitutional, or violates public policy.” A servitude violates public policy if it: (1) is arbitrary, spiteful, or capricious; (2) “unreasonably burdens a fundamental constitutional right”; (3) “imposes an unreasonable restraint of alienation”; (4) imposes an unreasonable restraint on trade or competition; or (5) is unconscionable. Which approach, the Restatement’s or the <i>Nahrstedt</i> court’s, seems better to you? Consider this question in connection with the Problems below, pages 567-568.</p>
<p id="e14a38f6-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>The business judgment rule.</i></b> In Lamden v. La Jolla Shores Clubdominium Homeowners Assn., 980 P.2d 940 (Cal. 1999), the court applied the business <span title="566" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-566">p. 566</span>judgment rule to sustain the decision of a homeowner association board. When a condominium became infested with termites, the association’s board decided to use spot treatment rather than to fumigate the entire building. When more termite infestation became apparent in one unit five years later, the unit owner brought an action against the board for damages allegedly resulting from the board’s decision not to fumigate the whole building. Ruling for the board, the court stated that in making financial decisions all that was required of the board was that it exercise its discretion in good faith, after reasonable investigation, and in the best interests of the association and its members. The court distinguished <i>Nahrstedt</i> on the ground that the no-pets rule was an equitable servitude, governed by California Civil Code §1354, whereas the board’s action in <i>Lamden</i> involved no equitable servitude, only a financial decision.</p>
<p id="e14a6007-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other courts have also applied the business judgment rule to homeowner associations. See America v.

<div class="epub-heading  left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="e14a6009-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f">Condominiums and Cooperatives</p></div>
<p id="e14a600a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Condominiums</i>. <i>Nahrstedt</i> involved a condominium. The basic idea of a condominium is simple. Each unit (or interior space) in a condominium is owned <i>separately in fee simple</i> by an individual owner. The exterior walls, the land beneath, the hallways, and other common areas are owned by the unit owners as <i>tenants in common.</i> Because each unit is owned separately, each owner obtains mortgage financing by a separate mortgage on the owner’s individual unit. Real estate taxes are assessed or allocated to each unit separately. The failure of one unit owner to pay mortgage interest or taxes does not jeopardize the other unit owners.</p>
<p id="e14a600b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The declaration of condominium, filed before the first sale is made, will provide for an association of unit owners to make and enforce rules, to manage the common areas, and to set maintenance charges levied against unit owners. Each purchaser, by accepting a deed, becomes an association member and must abide by its bylaws. All 50 states have some form of condominium statute governing this type of shared ownership.</p>
<p id="e14a600c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Each condominium unit owner is liable for a monthly charge to maintain common facilities and insure against casualty and liability. The condominium documents fix the fraction of each unit owner’s pro rata burden of common expenses. This fraction also may govern the unit owner’s voice in management and may be used by the tax assessor in apportioning the project’s total value among the separate units. Enforcement of condominium obligations may be covered by the state condominium statute or the condominium declaration.</p>
<p id="e14a600d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Cooperatives.</i> New York City is probably the only housing market in the country with a substantial number of cooperative apartments. In a housing cooperative, the title to the land and building is held by a corporation; the residents own all the shares of stock in the corporation and control it through an elected board of directors. Each resident also has a long-term renewable lease of an apartment unit. Hence residents are both owners of the cooperative corporation (by virtue of stock ownership) and tenants of the corporation.</p>
<span title="567" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-567">p. 567</span>
<p id="e14a600e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The cooperative property is usually subject to one blanket mortgage securing the money lender for the money borrowed to buy the land and erect the building. If one cooperator fails to pay his share of the mortgage interest or taxes, the other cooperators must make it up or the entire property may be foreclosed upon. Thus, in a cooperative more than a condominium, the investment of one person depends upon the financial stability of others. As a result, members of a cooperative have a strong incentive to screen applicants to ensure that they can carry their share of the collective mortgage.</p>
<p id="e14a600f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Financial screening also provides an opportunity for social screening. New York courts have held that cooperative boards can deny entry to anyone for any reason and without giving any reason, provided the board does not violate federal and state civil rights laws. Weisner v. 791 Park Ave. Corp., 160 N.E.2d 720 (N.Y. 1959). Because cooperatives can screen prospective members, and because of long experience with the cooperative form of housing, they continue to flourish in New York City despite the growth of condominiums in the rest of the country. (In a condominium in New York, the boards typically can prevent entry only by exercising a preemptive option; they rarely screen applicants by social criteria.)</p>

The suburbs outside Dallas, Phoenix, Washington, D.C., and major cities in Florida are also big strongholds of private communities. Last year, Minnesota’s first gated community, Bearpath, was built near Eden Prairie.…</p>

The exception cannot vest an interest in the third party, and the excepted interest remains in the grantor. (6 Powell, The Law of Real Property (Rohan ed. 1971) §892.)

Livery of seisin was required to transfer a possessory freehold estate (page 189), whereas easements were created by grant; i.e., a sealed instrument. Professor Simpson believed the rule against creating easements in third parties is traceable to the principle that only parties to a deed can take advantage of it. The same principle underlies the rule that third parties cannot sue on a contract (unless they are in privity of estate with a party). See pages 535-538, 542.—E<span class="epub-small-caps">DS</span>.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e142229a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN1026D_5eaa6106-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" id="note-N1026D_5eaa6106-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">3</a></span>&nbsp;(See generally Harris, Reservations in Favor of Strangers to the Title, supra, 6 Okla. L. Rev. 127, 139-150.) Some courts, like the court in Butler v. Gosling, supra, mitigate the harshness of the rule by treating the reservation as an exception that retained the interest in the grantor. (See Lemon v. Lemon (1918) 273 Mo. 484, 201 S.W. 103.) While this approach did prevent the reserved interest from passing to the grantee, it did not achieve the grantor’s intention of vesting that interest in the third party. Other courts gave effect to the grantor’s intention by estopping those who claimed under a chain of title including the deed containing the reservation from challenging it on the basis of the common law rule. (See Beinlein v. Johns (1898) 102 Ky. 570, 19 Ky. L.R. 1969, 44 S.W. 128; Hodge v. Boothby (1861) 48 Me. 68; Dalton v. Eller (1926) 153 Tenn. 418, 284 S.W. 68.) This approach has the effect of emasculating the common law rule without expressly abandoning it. One court found that a reservation created a trust in favor of the stranger (Burns v. Bastien (1935) 174 Okla. 40, 50 P.2d 377), but this approach seems unduly elaborate to achieve the grantor’s intent. Finally, several courts, like the court in <i>Boyer</i>, supra, will disregard the rule entirely when the stranger is the grantor’s spouse. (See Saunders v. Saunders (1940) 373 Ill. 302, 26 N.E.2d 126, 129 A.L.R. 306; Du Bois v. Judy (1920) 291 Ill. 340, 126 N.E. 104; Derham v. Hovey (1917) 195 Mich. 243, 161 N.W. 883, 21 A.L.R. 999; Glasgow v. Glasgow (1952) 221 S.C. 322, 70 S.E.2d 432.)

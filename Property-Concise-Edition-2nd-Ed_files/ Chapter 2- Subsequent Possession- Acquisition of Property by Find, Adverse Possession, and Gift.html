<p id="e0f6e8bf-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Possession, as we saw in the preceding chapter, is a powerful concept in the law of property. By virtue of <i>first</i> possession one can make an unowned thing, or a thing before enjoyed only by all in common, one’s own. But suppose the principle of first in time, so dominant in Chapter 1, no longer holds. Suppose that something <i>already</i> owned by someone else, say <i>A, subsequently</i> comes into the possession of <i>B</i>, and without <i>A</i>’s consent. Surprisingly enough, <i>B</i> might still become the thing’s “owner,” as the first two sections of this chapter make clear. Even without being declared the owner, <i>B</i> might nevertheless be granted considerable protection by the legal system. But when does <i>B</i> have “possession,” so as to enjoy this favored position, and why are possessors favored anyway? These important questions figured in the last chapter, and they do so again in this one.</p>
<p id="e0f6e8c0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another common theme persists. Chapter 1 was concerned, among other things, with acquisition of property other than by purchase, and this chapter is as well—right through to its final section, where we examine the law of gifts. Possession plays a role there, too.</p>

Flues were made to be small (about 9 by 14 inches), so that several could fit into one chimney. Hence sweeps employed little boys, sometimes as young as age four, to clean the flues, removing soot with brooms and scrapers as they worked their way up the tight spaces. The boys wore stovepipe hats to dislodge soot and keep it out of their eyes.</p>

He was the most celebrated and prolific silversmith of the finest period of English silver work, the first half of the eighteenth century. His work can be seen in many American museums, and his finest pieces have sold at auction for more than $1 million.</p>

<p id="e0f736f5-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff being a chimney sweeper’s boy found a jewel and carried it to the defendant’s shop (who was a goldsmith) to know what it was, and delivered it into the hands of the apprentice, who under pretence of weighing it, took out the stones, and calling to the master to let him know it came to three halfpence, the master offered the boy the money, who refused to take it, and insisted to have the thing again; whereupon the apprentice delivered him back the socket without the stones. And now in trover against the master these points were ruled:</p>
<p id="e0f736f6-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">1. That the finder of a jewel, though he does not by such finding acquire an absolute property or ownership, yet he has such a property as will enable him to keep it against all but the rightful owner, and consequently may maintain trover.</p>

<p id="e0f736fb-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>The legal principle of Armory v. Delamirie.</i></b> Based on judicial statements like that in the <i>Armory</i> case, it is often said “that the title of the finder is good as against the whole world but the true owner. . . .” Ray A. Brown, The Law of Personal Property 26 (Walter B. Raushenbush 3d ed. 1975). Is that an accurate or satisfactory statement of the principle of the case? To test it, suppose that <i>F1</i> loses a watch he had earlier found and that it is subsequently found by <i>F2. F1</i> sues <i>F2</i> for return of the watch. Who wins? The answer, as it happens, is that <i>F1</i> wins. Knowing this, how would you revise the statement so that it accurately states the law?</p>
<span title="123" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-123">p. 123</span>
<p id="e0f736fc-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In answering this question, it will be helpful to make explicit an important point that is implicit in much of what we saw earlier: property rights are relational. See, e.g., Note 3, page 45. The <i>F1-F2</i> problem illustrates a basic principle that builds on that insight: <i>title, or ownership, is</i> <i>relative.</i> The meaning of the phrase <i>true owner</i> depends upon who the other claimants are: <i>B</i> can have title as against <i>C</i> but not as against <i>A.</i></p>
<p id="e0f75e0d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>The jus tertii defense.</i></b> The relativity-of-title concept raises another important point involved in the question “Who is the ‘true’ owner of the jewel?” Although the court doesn’t tell us what the goldsmith’s defense was, he probably argued that he didn’t have to return the jewel to the sweep (the plaintiff) because the sweep could not prove ownership. In other words, the goldsmith asserted the rights of the absent true owner as a defense. This is sometimes known as the <i>jus tertii</i> (Latin for “rights of a third party”) defense, and, like the court in <i>Armory</i>, courts usually reject it. They require that the defendant stand on his own rights rather than those of a third party. Are the reasons for the rejection of the <i>jus tertii</i> defense substantive or procedural, or both? Suppose the identity of the true owner is known; should the court then be more willing to accept the <i>jus tertii</i> defense?</p>
<p id="e0f75e0e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>The cause of action in Armory—trover.</i></b> In Armory v. Delamirie, the plaintiff sued defendant in trover. <i>Trover</i> is the old common law action for money damages resulting from the defendant’s conversion to his own use of a chattel owned or possessed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff waives his right to obtain the return of the chattel and insists that the defendant be subjected to a forced purchase of the chattel from him. If the defendant loses, he must pay money damages to the plaintiff. Today trover is basically obsolete. It has largely been replaced by the tort of conversion.</p>
<p id="e0f75e0f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>The measure of damages.</i></b> The court awarded Armory the value of a “jewel of the finest water.” That means a jewel of the highest quality. So, Armory recovered damages equal to the full value of a jewel of the finest quality. Was that equal to the value of his interest in the jewel, or was the value of his interest equal to the value of the jewel discounted by the probability that the true owner will appear and reclaim it? If it was the latter, why did the court award him the full value of the jewel?</p>
<p id="e0f75e10-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. <i>Bailment.</i></b> When Armory left the jewel with de Lamerie he created a bailment <b>—</b> the rightful possession of goods by a person who is not the owner. The person who delivers the chattel is called the <i>bailor,</i> and the person who receives it is called the <i>bailee.</i> A bailee has possession but not title to the chattel. The creation of a bailment requires that the bailee both intend to possess and actually possess the chattel.</p>
<p id="e0f75e11-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Bailments are voluntary or involuntary. Voluntary bailments are very common. When you take your clothes to the laundry for cleaning, this creates a voluntary bailment. So, too, when you leave your car keys with a valet parking attendant. Involuntary bailments are less common, but they certainly do occur in ordinary life. A finder of a lost or mislaid chattel, such as Armory, is an involuntary bailee because the bailor has not voluntarily transferred possession to him.  </p>

<p id="e0f75e14-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A bailment transfers possession but not title to the bailee.

</div>
<p id="e0f75e15-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The standard of care that a bailee owes to a bailor depends upon who benefits from the bailment. If the bailor is the sole beneficiary (i.e., the bailee is not <span title="124" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-124">p. 124</span>compensated), the bailee is a “gratuitous” bailee, and the bailee is liable only if the property is damaged through his or her gross negligence. If the bailment benefits both parties, as in a car rental arrangement, then the bailee is liable if the property is damaged as a result of his or her ordinary negligence. Finally, if the relationship benefits only the bailee (e.g., the bailee borrows the bailor’s property without paying for it), then liability results from damage caused by the bailee’s “slight negligence.” </p>

<p id="e0f75e17-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>6. <i>Rights of the true owner.</i></b> Suppose that in 1723 the true owner of the jewel involved in the <i>Armory</i> case appeared at the goldsmith’s shop and demanded return of the jewel. What are the rights of the goldsmith and the true owner as against each other and as against the chimney sweeper’s boy? Generally, the subsequent possessor’s payment to the finder bars any later action by the true owner against the subsequent possessor. The true owner may, however, compel the finder to transfer the payment, which takes the place of the bailed chattel, to the true owner.</p>
<p id="e0f75e18-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>7. <i>Prior possessor as a thief.</i></b> Would it have made any difference in <i>Armory</i> if the chimney sweeper’s boy had taken the jewel off a dressing table in the house where he was cleaning the chimney? Generally, courts say no. In Anderson v. Gouldberg, 53 N.W. 636 (Minn. 1892), the plaintiffs trespassed upon the timberland of a third party, cut logs, and hauled them to a mill, where the defendants took them. Ruling for the trespassing plaintiff, the court said that “bare possession of property, though wrongfully obtained, is sufficient title to enable the party enjoying it to” prevail over the party who takes it from him. “Any other rule would lead to an endless series of unlawful seizures and reprisals in every case where property had once passed out of the possession of the rightful owner,” the court reasoned. Id. at 637. See also Payne v. TK Auto Wholesalers, 911 A.2d 747 (Conn. App. 2006) (citing <i>Anderson</i> favorably and recognizing the possessory interest of a wrongdoer as against all but the true owner of the property in question).</p>

On December 13, 1938, the freehold of Gwernhaylod House, Overton-on-Dee, Shropshire, was conveyed to the defendant, Major Hugh Edward Ethelston Peel, who from that time to the end of 1940 never himself occupied the house and it remained unoccupied until October 5, 1939, when it was requisitioned [for quartering soldiers], but after some months was released from requisition. Thereafter it remained unoccupied until July 18, 1940, when it was again requisitioned, the defendant being compensated by a payment at the rate of 250<i>l.</i> a year. In August, 1940, the plaintiff, Duncan Hannah, a lance-corporal, serving in a battery of the Royal Artillery, was stationed at the house and on the 21st of that month, when in a bedroom, used as a sick-bay, he was adjusting the black-out curtains when his hand touched something on the top of a window-frame, loose in a crevice, which he thought was a piece of dirt or plaster. The plaintiff grasped it and dropped it on the outside window ledge. On the following morning he saw that it was a brooch covered with cobwebs and dirt. Later, he took it with him when he went home on leave and his wife having told him it might be of value, at the end of October, 1940, he informed his commanding officer of his find and, on his advice, handed it over to the police, receiving a receipt for it. In August, 1942, the owner not having <span title="125" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-125">p. 125</span>been found the police handed the brooch to the defendant, who sold it in October, 1942, for 66<i>l.,</i> to Messrs. Spink &amp; Son, Ltd., of London, who resold it in the following month for 88<i>l.</i> There was no evidence that the defendant had any knowledge of the existence of the brooch before it was found by the plaintiff. The defendant had offered the plaintiff a reward for the brooch, but the plaintiff refused to accept this and maintained throughout his right to the possession of the brooch as against all persons other than the owner, who was unknown. By a letter, dated October 5, 1942, the plaintiff’s solicitors demanded the return of the brooch from the defendant, but it was not returned and on October 21, 1943, the plaintiff issued his writ claiming the return of the brooch, or its value, and damages for its detention. By his defence, the defendant claimed the brooch on the ground that he was the owner of Gwernhaylod House and in possession thereof. . . .</p>

As to the issue in law, the rival claims of the parties can be stated in this way: The plaintiff says: “I claim the brooch as its finder and I have a good title against all the world, save only the true owner.” The defendant says: “My claim is superior to yours in as much as I am the freeholder. The brooch was found on my property, although I was never in occupation, and my title, therefore, ousts yours and in the absence of the true owner I am entitled to the brooch or its value.” Unhappily the law on this issue is in a very uncertain state and there is need of an authoritative decision of a higher court. Obviously if it could be said with certainty that this is the law, that the finder of a lost article, wherever found, has a good title against all the world save the true owner, then, of course, all my difficulties would be resolved; or again, if it could be said with equal certainty that this is the law, that the possessor of land is entitled as against the finder to all chattels found on the land, again my difficulties would be resolved. But, unfortunately, the authorities give some support to each of these conflicting propositions. . . .</p>

<p id="e0f78533-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case of Bridges v. Hawkesworth, 21 L.J. (Q.B.) 75, 15 Jur. 1079, was . . . an appeal against a decision of the county court judge at Westminster. The facts appear to have been that in the year 1847 the plaintiff, who was a commercial traveller, called on a firm named Byfield &amp; Hawkesworth on business, as he was in the habit of doing, and as he was leaving the shop he picked up a small parcel which was lying on the floor. He immediately showed it to the shopman, and opened it in his presence, when it was found to consist of a quantity of Bank of England notes, to the amount of 65<i>l.</i> The defendant, who was a partner in the firm of Byfield &amp; Hawkesworth, was then called, and the plaintiff told him he had found the notes, and asked the defendant to keep them until the owner appeared to claim them. Then various advertisements were put in the papers asking for the owner, but the true owner was never found. No person having appeared to claim them, and three years having elapsed since they were found, the plaintiff applied to the defendant to have the notes returned to him, and offered to pay the expenses of the advertisements, and to give an indemnity. The defendant refused to deliver them up to the plaintiff, and an action was brought in the county court of Westminster in consequence of that refusal. The county court judge decided that the defendant, the shopkeeper, was entitled to the custody of the notes as against the plaintiff, and gave judgment for the defendant. Thereupon the appeal was brought which came before the court composed by Patteson, J., and Wightman, J. Patteson, J., said: “The notes which are the subject of this action were incidentally dropped, by mere accident, in the shop of the defendant, by the owner of them. The facts do not warrant the supposition that they had been deposited there intentionally, nor has the case been put at all upon that ground. The plaintiff found them on the floor, they being manifestly lost by someone. The general right of the finder to any article which has been lost, as against all the world, except the true owner, was established in the case of Armory v. Delamirie, 1 Str. 505, which has never been disputed. This right would clearly have accrued to the plaintiff had the notes been picked up by him outside the shop of the defendant and if he once had the right, the case finds that he did not intend, by delivering the notes to the defendant, to waive the title (if any) which he had to them, but they were handed to the defendant merely for the purpose of delivering them to the owner should he appear.” Then a little later: “The case, therefore, resolves itself into the single point on which it appears that the learned judge decided it, namely, whether the circumstance of the notes being found inside the defendant’s shop gives him, the defendant, the right to have them as against the plaintiff, who found them.” After discussing the cases, and the argument, the learned judge said: “If the discovery had never been communicated to the defendant, could the real owner have had any cause of action against him because they were found in his house? Certainly not. The notes never were in the custody of the defendant, nor within the protection of his house, before they were found, as they would have been had they been intentionally deposited there; and the defendant has come under no responsibility, except from the communication made to him by the plaintiff, the finder, and the steps taken by way of advertisement. . . . We find, therefore, no circumstances in this case to take it out of the general rule of law, that the finder of a lost article is entitled to it as against all persons except the real owner, and we think that that rule must prevail, and that the learned judge was mistaken in holding that the place in which they were found makes any legal difference. Our judgment, therefore, is that the plaintiff is entitled to these notes as against the defendant.”</p>
<p id="e0f78534-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is to be observed that in Bridges v. Hawkesworth, which has been the subject of immense disputation, neither counsel put forward any argument on the fact that <span title="127" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-127">p. 127</span>the notes were found in a shop. Counsel for the appellant assumed throughout that the position was the same as if the parcel had been found in a private house, and the learned judge spoke of “the protection of his” (the shopkeeper’s) “house.” The case for the appellant was that the shopkeeper never knew of the notes. Again, what is curious is that there was no suggestion that the place where the notes were found was in any way material; indeed, the judge in giving the judgment of the court expressly repudiates this and said in terms “The learned judge was mistaken in holding that the place in which they were found makes any legal difference.” It is, therefore, a little remarkable that in South Staffordshire Water Co. v. Sharman, [1896] 2 Q.B. 44, Lord Russell of Killowen, C.J., said: “The case of Bridges v. Hawkesworth stands by itself, and on special grounds; and on those grounds it seems to me that the decision in that case was right. Someone had accidentally dropped a bundle of banknotes in a public shop. The shopkeeper did not know they had been dropped, and did not in any sense exercise control over them. The shop was open to the public, and they were invited to come there.” That might be a matter of some doubt. Customers were invited there, but whether the public at large was, might be open to some question. Lord Russell continued: “A customer picked up the notes and gave them to the shopkeeper in order that he might advertise them. The owner of the notes was not found, and the finder then sought to recover them from the shopkeeper. It was held that he was entitled to do so, the ground of the decision being, as was pointed out by Patteson, J., that the notes, being dropped in the public part of the shop, were never in the custody of the shopkeeper, or ‘within the protection of his house.’ ” Patteson, J., never made any reference to the public part of the shop and, indeed, went out of his way to say that the learned county court judge was wrong in holding that the place where they were found made any legal difference. . . . </p>
<p id="e0f78535-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With regard to South Staffordshire Water Co. v. Sharman, [1896] 2 Q.B. 44, the first two lines of the headnote are: “The possessor of land is generally entitled, as against the finder, to chattels found on the land.” I am not sure that this is accurate. The facts were that the defendant Sharman, while cleaning out, under the orders of the plaintiffs, the South Staffordshire Water Company, a pool of water on their land, found two rings embedded in the mud at the bottom of the pool. He declined to deliver them to the plaintiffs, but failed to discover the real owner. In an action brought by the company against Sharman in detinue it was held that the company was entitled to the rings. Lord Russell of Killowen, C.J., said: “The plaintiffs are the freeholders of the locus in quo [literally, the place in which], and as such they have the right to forbid anybody coming on their land or in anyway interfering with it. They had the right to say that their pool should be cleaned out in any way that they thought fit, and to direct what should be done with anything found in the pool in the course of such cleaning out. It is no doubt right, as the counsel for the defendant contended, to say that the plaintiffs must show that they had actual control over the locus in quo and the things in it; but under the circumstances, can it be said that the Minster Pool and whatever might be in that pool were not under the control of the plaintiffs? In my opinion they were. . . . The principle on which this case must be decided, and the distinction which must be drawn between this case and that of Bridges v. Hawkesworth, is to be found in a passage in Pollock and Wright’s essay on Possession in the Common Law, p. 41: ‘The possession of land carries with it in general, by our law, possession of everything which is attached to or under that land, and, in the absence of a better title elsewhere, the right to possess it also. . . .’ ” And it makes no difference that the possessor is not aware of the thing’s existence. . . . </p>
<span title="128" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-128">p. 128</span>
<p id="e0f78536-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Then Lord Russell cited the passage which I read earlier in this judgment and continued: “It is somewhat strange”—I venture to echo those words—“that there is no more direct authority on the question; but the general principle seems to me to be that where a person has possession of house or land, with a manifest intention to exercise control over it and the things which may be upon or in it, then, if something is found on that land, whether by an employee of the owner or by a stranger, the presumption is that the possession of that thing is in the owner of the locus in quo.” It is to be observed that Lord Russell there is extending the meaning of the passage he had cited from Pollock and Wright’s essay on Possession in the Common Law, where the learned authors say that the possession of “land carries with it possession of everything which is attached to or under that land.” Then Lord Russell adds possession of everything which may be on or in that land. South Staffordshire Water Co. v. Sharman, which was relied on by counsel for the defendant, has also been the subject of some discussion. It has been said that it establishes that if a man finds a thing as the servant or agent of another, he finds it not for himself, but for that other, and indeed that seems to afford a sufficient explanation of the case. The rings found at the bottom of the pool were not in the possession of the company, but it seems that though Sharman was the first to obtain possession of them, he obtained them for his employers and could claim no title for himself.</p>
<p id="e0f7ac47-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The only other case to which I need refer is Elwes v. Brigg Gas Co., 33 Ch. D. 562, in which land had been demised to a gas company for ninety-nine years with a reservation to the lessor of all mines and minerals. A pre-historic boat embedded in the soil was discovered by the lessees when they were digging to make a gasholder. It was held that the boat, whether regarded as a mineral or as part of the soil in which it was embedded when discovered, or as a chattel, did not pass to the lessees by the demise, but was the property of the lessor though he was ignorant of its existence at the time of granting the lease. Chitty, J., said: “The first question which does actually arise in this case is whether the boat belonged to the plaintiff at the time of the granting of the lease. I hold that it did, whether it ought to be regarded as a mineral, or as part of the soil within the maxim above cited, or as a chattel. If it was a mineral or part of the soil in the sense above indicated, then it clearly belonged to the owners of the inheritance as part of the inheritance itself. But if it ought to be regarded as a chattel, I hold the property in the chattel was vested in the plaintiff, for the following reasons.” Then he gave the reasons, and continued: “The plaintiff then being thus in possession of the chattel, it follows that the property in the chattel was vested in him. Obviously the right of the original owner could not be established; it had for centuries been lost or barred, even supposing that the property had not been abandoned when the boat was first left on the spot where it was found. The plaintiff, then, had a lawful possession, good against all the world, and therefore the property in the boat. In my opinion it makes no difference, in these circumstances, that the plaintiff was not aware of the existence of the boat.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN101E2_5ea9c4ba-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N101E2_5ea9c4ba-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">1</a></span></p>

<p id="e0f7ac49-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A review of these judgments shows that the authorities are in an unsatisfactory state. . . .</p>
<p id="e0f7ac4a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is fairly clear from the authorities that a man possesses everything which is attached to or under his land. Secondly, it would appear to be the law from the authorities I have cited, and particularly from Bridges v. Hawkesworth, that a man does not necessarily possess a thing which is lying unattached on the surface of his land even though the thing is not possessed by someone else. A difficulty, however, arises . . . because the rule which governs things an occupier possesses as against those which he does not, has never been very clearly formulated in our law. . . . </p>
<p id="e0f7ac4b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no doubt that in this case the brooch was lost in the ordinary meaning of that term, and I should imagine it had been lost for a very considerable time. Indeed, from this correspondence it appears that at one time the predecessors in title of the defendant were considering making some claim. But the moment the plaintiff discovered that the brooch might be of some value, he took the advice of his commanding officer and handed it to the police. His conduct was commendable and meritorious. The defendant was never physically in possession of these premises at any time. It is clear that the brooch was never his, in the ordinary acceptation of the term, in that he had the prior possession. He had no knowledge of it, until it was brought to his notice by the finder. A discussion of the merits does not seem to help, but it is clear on the facts that the brooch was “lost” in the ordinary meaning of that word, that it was “found” by the plaintiff in the ordinary meaning of that word, that its true owner has never been found, that the defendant was the owner of the premises and had his notice drawn to this matter by the plaintiff, who found the brooch. In those circumstances I propose to follow the decision in Bridges v. Hawkesworth, and to give judgment in this case for the plaintiff for 66<i>l.</i></p>

<p id="e0f7ac4f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Back to Armory.</i></b> Armory v. Delamarie was a well-known case at the time of the decision in <i>Hannah</i>. In fact, the court in Bridges v. Hawkesworth, which the <i>Hannah</i> court discusses, cites <i>Armory</i>. Yet apparently the court in <i>Hannah</i> thought that <i>Armory</i> did not decide the issue posed in <i>Hannah</i>. Why not?</p>
<p id="e0f7ac50-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Ownership versus actual possession.</i></b> Major Peel owned Gwernhaylod House, but the court did not give much weight to this factor, apparently because he never occupied it. So, if Major Peel had resided in the house prior to the government requisitioning it, would he have won? See Parker v. British Airways Bd., [1982] 2 W.L.R. 503, 516-517: “I would be inclined to say that the occupier of a house will almost invariably possess any lost article on the premises. He may not have taken any positive steps to demonstrate his <i>animus possidendi</i>, but so firm is his control that the <i>animus</i> can be seen to attach to it” (per Eveleigh, L.J.). Should the owner’s actual possession be necessary? Recall that in Elwes v. Brigg Gas Co., cited in <i>Hannah</i>, the court awarded the prehistoric boat to the owner despite the fact that as the landlord of a 99-year lease he was very definitely out of possession. Consider also the fact that Major Peel intended to live in the house, but the military requisitioned it before he had a chance to move in. Should that matter?</p>
<span title="130" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-130">p. 130</span>
<p id="e0f7ac51-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Lost versus mislaid property.</i></b> American courts sometimes decide between the finder and the owner of the locus in quo on the basis of categorizing the found item as lost or mislaid. (English courts have never adopted this distinction.) See, e.g., McAvoy v. Medina, 93 Mass. (11 Allen) 548 (1866). An item is said to be <i>mislaid</i> if the owner intentionally placed it in some location and then forgot to retrieve it. An item is said to be <i>lost</i> when the owner inadvertently loses possession of it. If the item is mislaid, the owner of the locus in quo wins. The rationale is that this result aids return of the item to the true owner, who will usually retrace his steps to where he last left the item. Lost property usually goes to the finder because the true owner, who does not know the item’s whereabouts, is unlikely to retrace his steps and find it. Moreover, this result rewards the finder’s honesty. Was the brooch in <i>Hannah</i> lost or mislaid? Can you tell? Should it matter?</p>
<p id="e0f7ac52-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet another category of found property is <i>abandoned</i> property. Property is abandoned when the owner intentionally relinquishes all legal rights to it with no intention to confer rights on any particular person. Abandonment occurs all the time, of course, such as when you toss an item in the trash. According to the blackletter, when a person finds abandoned property, ownership goes to the finder. The policy of facilitating return of the item to the true owner is irrelevant in this context.</p>
<p id="e0f7d363-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Treasure trove.</i></b> Suppose you are helping a friend dig a new garden in your friend’s yard when you find, buried several inches below the surface, an old tin box containing silver coins. It turns out that the tin box dates to Civil War times and the coins are silver dollars. The total value of all of these items is nearly $25,000. Who is entitled to the box and the coins, you or your friend? The scenario involves yet a fourth category of found property, called <i>treasure trove</i>. Treasure trove is gold, silver, bullion, or money that has been concealed in a private place. At English common law, treasure trove (derived from the Old French <i>tresor trové</i>, found treasure) belonged to the king. Nowadays, it appears, the practice of the British Crown is to auction treasure trove to British museums and divide the receipts equally between the finder and the owner of the land where the treasure was discovered. Most American jurisdictions reject the treasure trove doctrine and treat it as either lost or mislaid property. In cases where the found item was buried, American courts usually give it to the owner of the land where it was found. See, e.g., Morgan v. Wiser, 711 S.W.2d 220 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1985).</p>
<p id="e0f7d364-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. <i>Legislation.</i></b> Many states have legislation covering lost, mislaid, and abandoned property—sometimes very lengthy and complicated legislation. A typical statute might require finders to deposit the property at a designated place, provide for notice to possible owners, and provide for an award of title—say to the finder—if the property owner does not appear within a specified period. Some statutes apply only to “lost property.” These statutes have often been construed narrowly to apply only to “lost” property as defined by common law and not to abolish the common law distinctions between types of found property.</p>
<p id="e0f7d365-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>6. <i>Shipwrecks.</i></b> Sunken treasure from ships sunk at sea is governed either by finders law or maritime law. The law of finders has usually been applied to ships lost in territorial waters, and the finder held entitled to an abandoned shipwreck unless the wreck was embedded in land owned or possessed by another. Given this, the United States and individual states have successfully asserted claims to shipwrecks embedded in their territorial waters and thus constructively possessed. <span title="131" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-131">p. 131</span>In the Abandoned Shipwreck Act of 1987, 43 U.S.C.A. §§2101-2106, the United States asserts title to any abandoned shipwreck embedded in submerged lands of a state and simultaneously transfers its title to the state in which the wreck is located. The purpose is to turn over management of embedded shipwrecks in state waters to the states and permit them to develop their own rules for salvage or preservation unimpeded by the general law. (The act provides that the law of finds and the law of salvage shall not apply to abandoned shipwrecks covered by its provisions.) For criticism of the act, see Forrest Booth, Who Owns Sunken Treasure? The Supreme Court, the Abandoned Shipwreck Act, and the Brother Jonathan, 11 U.S.F. Mar. L.J. 77 (1998-1999).</p>
<p id="e0f7d366-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The evidentiary standard required for proof of abandonment is high, so in most cases maritime law, with its principle of salvage awards, applies. Under maritime law, a ship lost at sea and settled on the seabed remains the owner’s property—unless title to the vessel was abandoned—but anyone subsequently reducing the ship or its cargo to possession is entitled to a salvage award. The law of salvage contrasts sharply with property law, which awards a finder all or nothing, subject to the rights of the true owner. Should the law of finders be changed so that the finder is entitled to an award (a reward) if the property in question is returned to its owner or held to be in possession of the owner of the locus?</p>

Suppose, for example, that <i>B</i> owns a parcel of land but never visits it. <i>A</i> occupies <i>B</i>’s land without <i>B</i>’s consent for a period of 20 years. Who owns the land at the end of the 20-year period? It is possible that <i>A</i> will, under the doctrine of adverse possession.</p>

<p id="e0f7fa7f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The idea that a property owner may lose title to another person who possesses the property without the owner’s permission is likely to seem strange at first. As one authority observed, “Title by adverse possession sounds, at first blush, like title by theft or robbery, a primitive method of acquiring land without paying for it.” Henry W. Ballantine, Title by Adverse Possession, 32 Harv. L. Rev. 135, 135 (1918). Plainly, such a doctrine requires some explanation.</p>
<p id="e0f7fa80-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Three policies, or theories, are commonly offered for the doctrine of adverse possession:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="e0f7fa81-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Avoiding stale claims</i>. The foundation of adverse possession law is statutory; specifically, the statute of limitations for recovering possession of land in cases of trespass. Like all other statutes of limitations, this statute’s purpose is to bar the assertion of claims based on old, unreliable evidence by limiting the time frame within which they may be brought to some reasonable period. If the owner’s claim for possession is not filed within this period, the owner loses title, and the adverse possessor gains a new and valid legal title.</p></li>
<li><p id="e0f7fa82-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Quiet titles/correct title errors</i>. Deeds and other legal instruments of title sometimes contain errors that affect the transferee’s title. The deed may be defective because it was improperly executed, or it may contain an error in the description of the property being conveyed. Adverse possession resolves these problems and quiets title after a period of time.</p></li>
<li><p id="e0f7fa83-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Protecting personal attachments</i>. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once wrote, “A thing which you have enjoyed and used as your own for a long time, whether property or an opinion, takes root in your being and cannot be torn away with your resenting the act and trying to defend yourself, however you came by it.” Oliver Wendell Holmes, The Path of the Law, 10 Harv. L. Rev. 457, 477 (1897). Cognitive psychologists now explain Holmes’s point in terms of “prospect theory,” which holds in part that people regard loss of an asset in hand as more significant than forgoing the opportunity to realize an apparently equivalent gain.</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="e0f7fa84-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Bear in mind that adverse possession does <i>not</i> function as a means of “transferring” ownership, at least not in a straightforward way. The running of the statute of limitations not only bars an action by the erstwhile owner, but also vests <span title="133" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-133">p. 133</span>a <i>new</i> title, created by operation of law, in the adverse possessor. Once acquired, this new title “relates back” to the date of the event that started the statute of limitations running, and the law acts as though the adverse possessor were the owner from that date.</p>

<p id="e0f7fa87-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Adverse possession law is a synthesis of statutory and judge-made law, with judicial rules supplementing the statutes of limitation that make up the core of adverse possession. These supplemental rules vary somewhat from state to state, but typically they state the following elements, or requirements, of adverse possession:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="e0f7fa88-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Actual entry</i>. One obvious reason that an actual entry is required is that adverse possession depends on a statute of limitations running against a cause of action, and the entry (without permission, adverse to the rights of the property owner, but more on this when we get to the fourth item) creates that cause of action—for trespass—and thereby triggers the statute. Entry also helps stake out what it is the adverse possessor might end up claiming. Moreover, some case law and academic commentary seem to suggest the idea that entry manifests an interloper who at least is working the property, making it productive, and by these means <i>earning</i> some rights.</p></li>
<li><p id="e0f82099-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Exclusive possession</i>. The exclusivity requirement does <i>not</i> mean that only the adverse possessor may use the property for the statutory period. Absolute exclusivity is not required. What exclusivity requires is that the adverse claimant’s possession and use cannot be shared with the true owner or with the public in general.</p></li>
<li><p id="e0f8209a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Open and notorious</i>. The meaning and purpose of this requirement is to assure that the adverse possessor’s entry and subsequent acts of use are of the sort that would put reasonably attentive property owners on notice that someone is on their property. The notoriety requirement is aimed at constructive, not actual, notice; the test of notoriety is objective. If the adverse possessor’s acts would be noticed by an ordinary person, then the owner is regarded as knowing what should have been known. This requirement reflects another rationale sometimes offered for adverse possession—the <i>sleeping</i> principle, according to which the purpose of adverse possession is “to penalize the negligent and dormant owner for sleeping upon his rights.” Ballantine, Title by Adverse Possession, supra, at 135.</p></li>
<li><p id="e0f8209b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>“Hostile and adverse” possession</i>. This does not mean that the adverse possessor must dislike the true owner. The term “hostile and adverse” (the term “claim of right” is also sometimes synonymously used) is a term of art. Its precise meaning is complex, and, as we will discuss below, courts do not agree on what evidence is required to satisfy this requirement. What the courts do agree on is that the claimant’s possession cannot be with the true owner’s permission. The owner’s permission gives a possessor a license, which negates the hostility requirement.</p></li>
<li><p id="e0f8209c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Continuous and uninterrupted</i>. Possession must be continuous for the statutory period, but not literally constant. An adverse possessor is permitted to come and go in the ordinary course, given the nature of the property in question (being on the farm most of the time; using the summer fishing camp for regular summer fishing trips, etc.). The true owner may interrupt the statute before it has run by bringing a successful ejectment action against the adverse possessor, or by re-entering the property. In the case of a successful ejectment action, the lawsuit interrupts the period of possession even if the owner does not thereafter actually oust the adverse possessor, who must start all over. See, e.g., Irving Pulp &amp; Paper Ltd. v. Kelly, 654 A.2d 416 (Me. 1995). As to re-entry by the true owner, it must be open and hostile and effective. See 3 American Law of Property §15.9.</p></li>

<p id="e0f820a6-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The adversity requirement and the adverse possessor’s state of mind.</i> By far the most confusing element of adverse possession law is the requirement that possession be “adverse” or “hostile” or “adverse and under claim of right.” Just what does this mean? A good way to approach the inquiry is in terms of the state of mind required of the adverse possessor, and in this respect existing doctrine reflects three different views:</p>
<p id="e0f847b7-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">1. State of mind is irrelevant. All that matters is the conduct of the adverse possessor. If the adverse possessor occupied and used the land in the way that one would expect of the true owner of land of that character, then that evidence is sufficient to establish adversity. The point behind this view is simple: once there is an entry against the true owner, she has a cause of action. Given that, shouldn’t the statute of limitations be running, <i>whatever</i> the entrant’s state of mind? See 3 American Law of Property §15.4 (1952), endorsing the view and suggesting it is the majority position in the United States.</p>
<p id="e0f847b8-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">2. The required state of mind is, “I thought I owned it.” This view requires a good-faith claim. It is voiced from time to time in American decisions. E.g., Halpern v. Lacy Inv. Corp., 379 S.E.2d 519, 521 (Ga. 1989) (“We hold that the correct rule is that one must enter upon the land claiming in good faith the right to do so. To enter upon the land without any honest claim of right to do so is but a trespass and can never ripen into prescriptive title.”). It is also codified in a few statutes. E.g., N.Y. Real Prop. Acts. &amp; Proc. §501(3) (McKinney 2016).</p>
<p id="e0f847b9-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">3. The required state of mind is, “I thought I didn’t own it, but I intended to make it mine.” According to this view, to qualify as adverse possessors, occupants must intend to take the property even if they know it doesn’t belong to them.</p>
<p id="e0f847ba-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These different views have been called, respectively, “the <i>objective standard</i>, the <i>good-faith standard</i>, and the <i>aggressive trespass standard</i>.” Margaret Jane Radin, Time, Possession, and Alienation, 64 Wash. U. L.Q. 739, 746-747 (1986) (emphasis added). Think about which view the court in the next case adopts, and whether that view seems appropriate in light of the underlying purposes of adverse possession.</p>

<p id="e0f86edc-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The 4.5 acres at issue are situated in Pulaski County, near the town of Scott. The parcel is irregularly configured and has eleven sides. The northernmost part of the parcel abuts Old Highway 30 for approximately 115 feet. A single-story church building is situated near the highway. This building is the meeting place for appellee, the Progressive Church, Inc. When the litigation between the parties began, appellant Fulkerson had held legal title to the parcel since December 1949. Sometime in 1985, the congregation of the Progressive Church, without obtaining permission from Fulkerson, began using the church building on the property as their place of worship. Over the next several years, the congregation greatly improved the church building itself and the surrounding land. . . .</p>
<p id="e0f86edd-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In November 1994, Fulkerson sent to Reverend Van Buren a letter demanding that he and the church congregation immediately vacate the church building located on the parcel. The church did not vacate the premises. In May 1995, Fulkerson filed in Pulaski County Circuit Court a complaint in which he requested that the court eject the congregation from the church building and from the rest of the parcel at issue. . . . [The church filed a response and a counterclaim] assert[ing] that it owned the parcel of land at issue by adverse possession and requested that the matter be transferred to chancery court to quiet title to the land after recognition of its ownership of the parcel. In October 1996, trial was held in Pulaski County Circuit Court in connection with Fulkerson’s complaint and the church’s counterclaim. After hearing testimony from witnesses presented by both parties, the circuit court subsequently caused to be entered a judgment in which the court determined that . . . the Progressive Church owned the parcel of land by adverse possession.</p>
<p id="e0f86ede-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The legal principles governing establishment of title to land by adverse possession are well established. We recently set forth these principles as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="e0f86edf-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is well settled that, in order to establish title by adverse possession, appellee had the burden of proving that she had been in possession of the property continuously for more than seven years and that her possession was visible, notorious, distinct, exclusive, hostile, and with intent to hold against the true owner. The proof required as to the extent of possession and dominion may vary according to the location and character of the land. It is ordinarily sufficient that the acts of ownership are of such a nature as one would exercise over her own property and would not exercise over that of another, and that the acts amount to such dominion over the land as to which it is reasonably adapted. . . .</p>
</div>
<p id="e0f86ee0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moses v. Dautartas, 922 S.W.2d 345 (1996). . . . For possession to be adverse, it is only necessary that it be hostile in the sense that it is under a claim of right, title, or ownership as distinguished from possession in conformity with, recognition of, or subservience to the superior right of the holder of title to the land. <i>Id</i>. Possession of land will not ordinarily be presumed to be adverse, but rather subservient to the true owner of the land. <i>See</i> Dillaha v. Temple, 590 S.W.2d 331 (1979). Therefore, mere possession of land is not enough to adversely possess the land, and there is every presumption that possession of land is in subordination to the holder of the legal title to the land. <i>Id</i>. The intention to hold adversely must be clear, distinct, and unequivocal. <i>Id</i>. . . . </p>
<p id="e0f86ee1-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The core of the church’s proof of adverse possession of the 4.5 acres at issue was provided by appellee, Reverend Sylvester Van Buren. As noted above, the intent required for adverse possession is the intention to claim the land at issue under right, title, or ownership as distinguished from possession in conformity with, recognition of, or subservience to the superior right of the true owner of the land. We conclude that Reverend Van Buren’s testimony shows that, from the time the congregation occupied <span title="137" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-137">p. 137</span>the church building on the parcel until November 1994, the church congregation was unsure of the precise nature of its interest in the land and, moreover, recognized that Fulkerson owned the land.</p>
<p id="e0f86ee2-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On cross-examination, Reverend Van Buren testified that in 1990 or 1991 he first realized that the church did not have a deed to the land at issue. He testified further that, prior to this time, he made no assumptions about whether the church was on the land with permission or whether the church had purchased the land. Reverend Van Buren specifically stated in this regard, “I didn’t know how or what kind of possession they had.” In order to clarify the matter of the church’s right to occupy the land, Reverend Van Buren contacted appellant Fulkerson. He asked Fulkerson to give a quitclaim deed to the church, which Fulkerson refused to do. Reverend Van Buren testified further that, after Fulkerson told him that he (Fulkerson) held legal title to the land, he (Van Buren) “accepted that as a fact.” In this regard, Reverend Van Buren testified:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="e0f895f3-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I had no way of knowing. I did some research on the layout of the land and saw where he had acquired the land from a relative somewhere’s . . . between 1940 and ’59 or somewhere like that. So I saw he acquired the land. And I saw no other records. During this time the courthouse was taken down and they had moved to another temporary location and everything they had was on microfilm and a lot of things wasn’t clear. But as far as I knew he clearly had possession. And this is after we had talked and all. And even some weeks before we went to court. That this took place which is just a couple of years ago. Last year rather.</p>
</div>
<p id="e0f895f4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With regard to the time at which the church congregation decided to claim the land at issue, Reverend Van Buren testified:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="e0f895f5-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once the term adverse had been positioned and he [Fulkerson] had caused us to be evicted or had asked us out of the church and we had no other alternatives. I just wondered what we should do. It wasn’t a decision that was made impulsively at that time. We made the decision that we wanted the land once we found out it wasn’t ours. And as far as adverse, adverse only came into play when no other avenue worked.</p>

<p id="e0f895f7-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given this testimony by Reverend Van Buren, given that a possessor of land does not possess adversely if, while in possession, he recognizes the ownership right of the titleholder to the land, and given that proof of the possessor’s intention to hold adversely must be clear, distinct, and unequivocal and must have lasted seven years, we conclude that the circuit court’s finding of fact that the congregation of the Progressive Church possessed for seven years the requisite intent to possess the land at issue adversely to appellant Fulkerson is clearly against the preponderance of the evidence. Because the church congregation did not possess the land with the requisite intent for seven years, the church congregation did not adversely possess the land.</p>

The trial court determined that appellees established their claim for adverse possession of the tract of land they had occupied since 1985. Because I do not believe the trial court’s findings of fact are clearly erroneous or clearly against the preponderance of the evidence, I would affirm.</p>
<p id="e0f895fb-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reverend Van Buren testified that he became pastor of The Progressive Church in 1985 and that he and other church members immediately began cleaning up the premises, which he described as a “wilderness” and “dumping site.” The land was overgrown with vines and littered with storm debris, and the church building was infested with snakes. They cut down trees, cleared out debris, and cleaned up the highway frontage so that the building became visible from the road. They repaired the building by installing central heat and air, and by replacing the roof, siding, windows, and floor. They added a 40-foot building and office. After two years, the property was in “immaculate” condition, and the congregation received compliments for their efforts from the local community. When asked whether he had treated the property as his own, Reverend Van Buren asserted: “There’s no way that I would have gone to this property and cleared it by hand . . . if I had assumed we didn’t have business being there, the right to be there, or if the church didn’t have the needed possession.”</p>
<p id="e0f895fc-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reverend Van Buren further testified that he had no dealings whatsoever with appellant until sometime in the early nineties, when appellant stopped by the church, asked to speak to the preacher, complimented him on the church’s efforts to improve the appearance of the church and grounds, but was silent as to his ownership of the site. It was not until 1992 that appellant, through his attorney, notified appellee that he (appellant) owned the land and was willing to negotiate a lease with the church. Subsequently, appellant personally spoke to Reverend Van Buren about a lease. Ultimately, appellant’s attorney sent appellees a demand to vacate dated November 4, 1994, and filed the ejectment action in May 1995. All during this time, The Progressive Church steadfastly refused to negotiate with appellant, asserted its intent to remain in possession, and defied eviction efforts. Reverend Van Buren repeatedly asked appellant for a quitclaim deed to the premises. He contended there were never any “negotiations” with appellant for a lease, and “the only reason lease was mentioned is because Mr. Fulkerson dominated the conversation. You only talk about what Mr. Fulkerson wants to talk about. It doesn’t matter what you say.”</p>
<p id="e0f895fd-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To establish adverse possession which ripens into ownership, the claimant must prove possession for seven years that has been actual, open, notorious, continuous, hostile, and exclusive, accompanied with an intent to hold against the true owner. Utley v. Ruff, 502 S.W.2d 629, 632 (1973). The majority believes appellee failed to establish the requisite intent to hold against the true owner, because once appellant asserted his ownership and the church “recognized” appellant’s ownership right, the church’s occupancy ceased to be adverse, thus interrupting the seven-year statutory period. I disagree.</p>
<p id="e0f895fe-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, I do not believe the church recognized appellant’s ownership. Church members began to occupy the premises in 1985, using the building regularly, without interruption, and without notice of appellant’s ownership until 1992. After being notified of appellant’s title and after receiving a demand to vacate and later an eviction notice, they continued to occupy the premises, using the building regularly and without interruption. By their actions, the congregation continued to repudiate appellant’s ownership even through the date of trial and beyond. To date, they have been in continuous possession for almost thirteen years.</p>
<p id="e0f895ff-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, I believe the church clearly demonstrated a hostile intent within the meaning of the law. As this court stated in Walker v. Hubbard, 787 S.W.2d 251 (1990):</p>

Barclay v. Tussey, 532 S.W.2d 193, 195 (1976).

<p id="e0f8bd16-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fulkerson had previously allowed another church group, Bailey’s Chapel, to use his land. In 1981, that group had signed an agreement with Fulkerson in which the group acknowledged that its use of the land was with Fulkerson’s permission. Some time later, at an unknown date in the 1980s, Bailey’s Chapel dissolved and discontinued use of Fulkerson’s land without informing Fulkerson. The Progressive Church moved its location to the Fulkerson property in 1985, but Fulkerson did not realize that they, not Bailey’s Chapel, were in possession until 1990. The Progressive Church eventually moved to a different location a few miles away. Recently, the building on the Fulkerson site remained unoccupied and is in dilapidated condition. The vegetation that the Progressive Church members cleared away is slowly taking over again.

Did it clearly adopt any one of the three? Does the dissent agree with the majority about which standard applies? As we indicated earlier, the objective standard is, by most authority, the majority approach. Under that approach, how would <i>Fulkerson</i> be decided?</p>
<p id="e0f8bd1a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Effectuating adverse possession’s objectives.</i></b> Go back to the various rationales for adverse possession that we described earlier.

She reasons that the real goal of adverse possession law is maximizing economic efficiency to giving title to the party who values it more highly. She seeks to eliminate the inefficient trespass; i.e., one that harms the record owner more than it benefits the trespasser, and to <span title="140" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-140">p. 140</span>encourage the efficient trespass; i.e., one that benefits the trespasser more than it harms the record owner. To accomplish this goal, she would insert a knowing-trespass requirement, which the trespasser must satisfy through documented evidence, such as a written purchaser offer. See Lee Anne Fennell, Efficient Trespass: The Case for “Bad Faith” Adverse Possession, 100 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1037, 1043 (2006). Is this a good idea?</p>

<p id="e0f8e42d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The open and notorious requirement.</i> Notoriety is usually straightforward, but not always. Consider an instance where adverse possession is underground. Suppose that <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are neighbors whose parcels of land lie over a cave, the entrance to which is on <i>A</i>’s land. <i>A</i> discovers the entrance, explores the full domain of the cave, and then opens it up to the public for a fee. <i>A</i>’s business, well known to <i>B</i>, runs for many years. After the statute of limitations has expired, <i>B</i> learns that part of the cave is under his land and brings suit to quiet his title to that part; <i>A</i> in turn claims title to the entire cave by adverse possession. Was <i>A</i>’s possession open and notorious? Not according to Marengo Cave Co. v. Ross, 10 N.E.2d 917 (Ind. 1937). The court gave three reasons for this conclusion. First, although <i>B</i> long knew of the cave’s existence, he did not know whether any portion of the cave lay underneath his land, a fact that would require a survey of the land. But because the entrance to the cave was under <i>A</i>’s land, <i>B</i> could not obtain a survey without <i>A</i>’s permission. So, the cost of obtaining the survey was high relative to the value of the property at stake. The second reason was the discovery rule, according to which the statute of limitation does not start to run until the plaintiff knew or should have known of the defendant’s wrong. The implication is that <i>B</i> did not know and should not be charged with knowledge that <i>A</i> was trespassing under his land until the survey results were revealed. Third, in the court’s view, underground trespass is a form of fraud. Are these reasons persuasive? In thinking about this question, bear in mind the following points: (1) In cost-benefit terms in <i>Marengo</i>, <i>B</i> did eventually get a court order directing <i>A</i> to permit a survey. Such an order could have been obtained at any time before the statute ran out. (2) The question of when <i>B</i> reasonably could have discovered <i>A</i>’s wrongdoing boils down to whether it was reasonable to require <i>B</i> to seek a court order authorizing a survey, which we know <i>B</i> eventually got. (3) Fraud is an intentional tort that requires a showing that the wrongdoer intentionally or recklessly deceived the victim. Here, we have a finding that <i>A</i> did not know that the cave extended under <i>B</i>’s land.</p>
<p id="e0f8e42e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Owning below and above the surface: the</i> ad coelum <i>doctrine</i>. It is implicit in <i>Marengo</i> that the owner of a surface parcel also owns the part of a common cave underlying the parcel. This follows from the so-called <i>ad coelum</i> doctrine: <i>Cujus est solum, ejus est usque ad coelum et ad infernos</i> (“to whomsoever the soil belongs, he owns also to the sky and to the depths”). Would it make more sense to say that the owner of the land on which sits the entrance to a cave owns the cave? To say that whoever discovers a cave and opens it to access owns the cave? To say that all the overlying landowners own the cave together, in common? Given <i>ad coelum</i> and the three alternatives, which is best? For contending views on that question, see the majority, concurring, and dissenting opinions in Edwards v. Sims, 24 S.W.2d 619 (Ky. 1929), and Edwards v. Lee’s Admr., 96 S.W.2d 1028 (Ky. 1936).</p>
<p id="e0f8e42f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to the <i>ad coelum</i> doctrine, the surface owner also owns the airspace above his land. Of course, this doctrine is not applied literally today. A landowner <span title="141" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-141">p. 141</span>certainly owns the airspace immediately above his land, but how much higher? Think of airplanes, for example. In United States v. Causby, 328 U.S. 256 (1946), the Court held that the federal government effectively took part of the landowner’s airspace when military airplanes continuously flew over the land at a very low altitude during World War II. The Court said that the landowner “owns at least as much of the space above the ground as he can occupy or use in connection with the land.” More recently, the question of ownership of airspace has come up with the growing popularity of small unmanned aircraft known as drones. In June 2016, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a new rule regulating the operation of drones. The rule provides, among other things, that the drone must remain within the operator’s visual line of sight, may not operate over persons not involved in its operation, and may not operate higher than 400 feet above ground level. See 14 CFR Parts 21, 43, 61, 91, 101, 107, 119, 133, and 183. </p>
<p id="e0f8e430-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Color of title and constructive adverse possession.</i> All states provide certain advantages to the adverse possessor whose possession is under color of title. <i>Color of title</i> refers to a claim founded on a written instrument (a deed, a will) or a judgment or decree that is for some reason defective and invalid (as when the grantor does not own the land conveyed by deed or is incompetent to convey, or the deed is improperly executed). Claim under color of title was not required by English law and is not required in most American jurisdictions. In a few states, color of title is essential to acquiring title by adverse possession.</p>
<p id="e0f8e431-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In some states, a shorter statute of limitations is applicable to adverse possessors with color of title than to those without. In all states, entry with color of title may have an advantage where the adverse possessor enters into possession of only a part of the property. Actual possession under color of title of only a part of the land covered by the defective writing is <i>constructive</i> possession of all that the writing describes. The advantage that a person may gain from constructive possession is that the activities relied upon to establish adverse possession reach not only the part of the premises actually occupied, but the entire premises described in a deed to the claimant. This doctrine of constructive adverse possession under color of title, established by judicial rule in some states and by statute in others, is, however, subject to some limitations.</p>

<p id="e0f90b4e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The World Mission Church of Washington, D.C. (the church), filed a motion for judgment seeking to recover possession of a strip of its land in Fairfax County. The church claimed that Carolyn Hollander, an adjoining property owner, “unlawfully withheld” the land. Hollander responded by claiming title by adverse possession.</p>
<p id="e0f90b4f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At a trial before the court, the evidence indicated that the church had record title to the land in dispute. The dispute arose because Hollander and her predecessors in title (the claimants) had used the disputed land mistakenly believing that their property ran to a line of trees at the edge of woods on the church’s property.</p>
<p id="e0f90b50-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After hearing both parties’ evidence, the court concluded that all the elements necessary to establish title by adverse possession had been clearly established except for the requirement of an adverse or hostile possession. Because the claimants’ possession of the land was based on a mistake as to the ownership of the land, the trial court determined that the possession was not adverse since “there was no intent of the claimant in this case to oust the true owner of the title of the property.” Hence, the court entered final judgment for the church. Hollander appeals.</p>
<p id="e0f90b51-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hollander’s evidence disclosed that the claimants had mowed, gardened, and otherwise maintained the strip of land up to the tree line as a part of their residential property for more than 15 years, believing that it was the common boundary between their property and the church’s property. The evidence also indicated that the claimants intended to claim title to the land extending to that line as a part of the property they thought was conveyed to them.</p>
<p id="e0f90b52-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hollander contends that this evidence is sufficient to show that the claimants did not base their claim solely on their deed descriptions; rather, it shows their intention to claim title to a definite line on the ground. Hence, Hollander maintains that this case is controlled by our decision in Christian v. Bulbeck, 90 S.E. 661 (1916). On the other hand, the church, relying primarily on our ruling in Chaney v. Haynes, 458 S.E.2d 451, 453, contends that the claimants’ mistake precludes a finding that their possession was with the necessary adverse or hostile intent.</p>

That is to say, on the whole proof a case must be presented in which the preponderance of evidence as to the character of the possession, how held, how evidenced on the ground, how regarded by the adjoining land owner, etc., etc., supplies the proof that the definite and positive intention on the part of the possessor to occupy, use and claim as his own the land up to a particular and definite line <i>on the ground</i> existed, coupled with the requisite possession, for the statutory period, in order to ripen title under the statute.

<p id="e0f9326c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>State of mind, again.</i></b> The adversity (or hostility) requirement has proven to be especially problematic in the context of boundary dispute cases. Most jurisdictions follow the objective standard, which, as we saw earlier, provides that <span title="144" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-144">p. 144</span>the adverse possessor’s subjective state of mind is irrelevant. Adversity is judged solely on the basis of the adverse possessor’s conduct. A significant minority of jurisdictions follow the “Maine doctrine,” however. It is so called because it was first adopted by the courts in Maine, which have since repudiated it in favor of the “Connecticut doctrine,” which is the objective approach. Under the Maine doctrine, to prove adversity, the adverse possessor must have “an intention to claim title to all land within a certain boundary on the face of the earth, whether it shall eventually be found to be the correct one or not.” Preble v. Maine Cent. R. Co., 27 A. 149, 150 (Me. 1893). Under this approach, an adverse possessor whose possession of part of his neighbor’s property was the result of a mistake loses: mistake negates adverse intent.</p>
<p id="e0f9326d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Did the Virginia court in <i>Hollander</i> accept or reject the Maine doctrine? What was its approach to the adversity requirement?</p>
<p id="e0f9326e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Mistaken improvers.</i></b> A problem that can occur in the context of both boundary disputes and adverse possession of larger areas is that of the innocent improver, someone who mistakenly builds on land belonging to another. The early common law on this matter was rather harsh: anything built on the wrong land, whether in good faith or not, became the property of the landowner (subject to the usual exceptions for delay, acquiescence, and estoppel). The modern tendency is to ease the plight of innocent improvers—in that case, by forcing a conveyance (at market value) of land from the owner to the improver. A variation is to give the landowner the option to buy the improvement (again, at market value) instead. Some states have legislation (often called “occupying claimant” or “betterment” acts) that set out these and other remedies.</p>
<p id="e0f9326f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the inconvenience caused by an innocent encroachment is so minor as to be trivial, relief might be denied altogether. If, on the other hand, the encroachment takes up a substantial part of the land in question, removal might be ordered notwithstanding the good faith of the encroaching party, depending upon how the court in a particular case strikes a balance between competing considerations. See, e.g., Amkco Ltd., Co. v. Wellborn, 21 P.3d 24 (N.M. 2001), involving an unintentional encroachment that took up almost 10 percent of the plaintiff’s land. The court applied a two-part test. First, the plaintiff has to show that it would suffer irreparable harm if removal were denied. But even if irreparable harm is proved, still the relief might be denied under a balancing test that compares the hardship to the plaintiff if removal is denied to the hardship to the defendant if it is granted. If this relative hardship test precludes removal of the encroachment, the encroaching party acquires either title or an easement in the land and pays damages accordingly.</p>
<p id="e0f93270-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Compare intentional encroachments, as to which most courts require removal of the offending structure, no matter how costly that might be. Why treat intentional encroachers so harshly? See Stewart E. Sterk, Property Rules, Liability Rules, and Uncertainty About Property Rights, 106 Mich. L. Rev. 1285, 1296-1297, 1319-1323 (2008).</p>

<p id="e0f95982-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Agreed boundaries, acquiescence, and estoppel</i>. Boundary disputes may also be resolved by the doctrines of <i>agreed boundaries</i>, <i>acquiescence</i>, and <i>estoppel</i>. The doctrine of agreed boundaries provides that if there is uncertainty between neighbors <span title="145" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-145">p. 145</span>as to the true boundary line, an oral agreement to settle the matter is enforceable if the neighbors subsequently accept the line for a long period of time. The doctrine of acquiescence provides that long acquiescence—though perhaps for a period of time shorter than the statute of limitations—is evidence of an agreement between the parties fixing the boundary line. The doctrine of estoppel comes into play when one neighbor makes representations about (or engages in conduct that tends to indicate) the location of a common boundary, and the other neighbor then changes her position in reliance on the representations or conduct. The first neighbor is then estopped to deny the validity of his statements or acts. Estoppel has also been applied when one neighbor remains silent in the face of expenditures by another that suggest the latter’s notion of the boundary’s location. The three doctrines are commonly interwoven by the courts, leaving the law vague and tricky to apply.</p>

Land surveying is an ancient art but not one free of the errors that often creep into the affairs of men. In this case, we are presented with the question of what happens when the descriptions in deeds do not fit the land the deed holders are occupying. Defendants appeal from a decree quieting title in the plaintiffs of a tract of land on the shore of Hood Canal in Mason County.</p>
<p id="e0f9598d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At least as long ago as 1932 the record tells us that one McCall resided in the house now occupied by the appellant-defendants, Kunto. McCall had a deed that described a 50-foot wide parcel on the shore of Hood Canal. The error that brings this case before us is that the 50 feet described in the deed is not the same 50 feet upon which McCall’s house stood. Rather, the described land is an adjacent 50-foot lot directly west of that upon which the house stood. In other words, McCall’s house stood on one lot and his deed described the adjacent lot. Several property owners to the west of defendants, not parties to this action, are similarly situated.</p>
<p id="e0f9598e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Over the years since 1946, several conveyances occurred, using the same legal description and accompanied by a transfer of possession to the succeeding occupants. The Kuntos’ immediate predecessors in interest, the Millers, desired to build a dock. To this end, they had a survey performed which indicated that the deed description and the physical occupation were in conformity. Several boundary stakes were placed as a result of this survey and the dock was constructed, as well as other improvements. The house as well as the others in the area continued to be used as summer recreational retreats.</p>
<p id="e0f9598f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Kuntos then took possession of the disputed property under a deed from the Millers in 1959. In 1960 the respondent-plaintiffs, Howard, who held land east of that of the Kuntos, determined to convey an undivided one-half interest in their land to </p>

After expending considerable effort, the surveyor retained by the Howards discovered that according to the government survey, the deed descriptions and the land occupancy of the parties did not coincide. Between the Howards and the Kuntos lay the Moyers’ property. When the Howards’ survey was completed, they discovered that they were the record owners of the land occupied by the Moyers and that the Moyers held record title to the land occupied by the Kuntos. Howard approached Moyer and in return for a conveyance of the land upon which the Moyers’ house stood, Moyer conveyed to the Howards record title to the land upon which the Kunto house stood. Until plaintiffs Howard obtained the conveyance from Moyer in April, 1960, neither Moyer nor any of his predecessors ever asserted any right to ownership of the property actually being possessed by Kunto and his predecessors. This action was then instituted to quiet title in the Howards and Yearlys. The Kuntos appeal from a trial court decision granting this remedy.</p>

<p id="e0f9a7c0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two issues are presented by this appeal:</p>
<p id="e0f9a7c1-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(1) Is a claim of adverse possession defeated because the physical use of the premises is restricted to summer occupancy?</p>
<p id="e0f9a7c2-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(2) May a person who receives record title to tract A under the mistaken belief that he has title to tract B (immediately contiguous to tract A) and who subsequently occupies tract B, for the purpose of establishing title to tract B by adverse possession, use the periods of possession of tract B by his immediate predecessors who also had record title to tract A?</p>
<p id="e0f9a7c3-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In approaching both of these questions, we point out that the evidence, largely undisputed in any material sense, established that defendant or his immediate predecessors did occupy the premises, which we have called tract B, as though it was their own for more than the 10 years as prescribed in RCW 4.16.020.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN106E3_5ea9c4ba-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N106E3_5ea9c4ba-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">4</a></span></p>
<p id="e0f9ced8-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We also point out that finding of fact 6 is not challenged for its factual determinations but for the conclusions contained therein to the effect that the continuity of possession <span title="148" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-148">p. 148</span>may not be established by summer occupancy, and that a predecessor’s possession may not be tacked because a legal “claim of right” did not exist under the circumstances.</p>
<p id="e0f9ced9-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We start with the oft-quoted rule that: “[T]o constitute adverse possession, there must be actual possession which is <i>uninterrupted</i>, open and notorious, hostile and exclusive, and under a <i>claim of right</i> made in good faith for the statutory period.” (Italics ours.) Butler v. Anderson, 71 Wash. 2d 60, 64, 426 P.2d 467, 470 (1967).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10707_5ea9c4ba-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10707_5ea9c4ba-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">5</a></span></p>
<p id="e0f9cedb-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We reject the conclusion that summer occupancy only of a summer beach home destroys the continuity of possession required by the statute. It has become firmly established that the requisite possession requires such possession and dominion “as ordinarily marks the conduct of owners in general in holding, managing, and caring for property of like nature and condition.” Whalen v. Smith, 183 Iowa 949, 953, 167 N.W. 646, 647 (1918). . . . </p>
<p id="e0f9cedc-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We hold that occupancy of tract B during the summer months for more than the 10-year period by defendant and his predecessors, together with the continued existence of the improvements on the land and beach area, constituted “uninterrupted” possession within this rule. To hold otherwise is to completely ignore the nature and condition of the property. . . . </p>
<p id="e0f9cedd-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We find such rule fully consonant with the legal writers on the subject. In F. Clark, Law of Surveying and Boundaries, §561 (3d ed. 1959) at 565: “Continuity of possession may be established although the land is used regularly for only a certain period each year.” Further, at 566:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="e0f9cede-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This rule . . . is one of substance and not of absolute mathematical continuity, provided there is no break so as to sever two possessions. It is not necessary that the occupant should be actually upon the premises continually. If the land is occupied during the period of time during the year it is capable of use, there is sufficient continuity.</p>
</div>
<p id="e0f9cedf-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We now reach the question of tacking. The precise issue before us is novel in that none of the property occupied by defendant or his predecessors coincided with the property described in their deeds, but was contiguous.</p>
<p id="e0f9cee0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the typical case, which has been subject to much litigation, the party seeking to establish title by adverse possession claims <i>more</i> land than that described in the deed. In such cases it is clear that tacking is permitted.</p>
<p id="e0f9cee1-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Buchanan v. Cassell, 53 Wash. 2d 611, 614, 335 P.2d 600, 602 (1959), the Supreme Court stated: “This state follows the rule that a purchaser may tack the adverse use of its predecessor in interest to that of his own where the land was intended to be included in the deed between them, but was mistakenly omitted from the description.” El Cerito, Inc. v. Ryndak, 60 Wash. 2d 847, 376 P.2d 528 (1962).</p>
<p id="e0f9cee2-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The general statement which appears in many of the cases is that tacking of adverse possession is permitted if the successive occupants are in “privity.” See Faubion v. Elder, 49 Wash. 2d 300, 301 P.2d 153 (1956). The deed running between the parties purporting to transfer the land possessed traditionally furnishes the privity of estate which connects the possession of the successive occupants. Plaintiff <span title="149" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-149">p. 149</span>contends, and the trial court ruled, that where the deed does not describe <i>any</i> of the land which was occupied, the actual transfer of possession is insufficient to establish privity.</p>
<p id="e0f9cee3-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To assess the cogency of this argument and ruling, we must turn to the historical reasons for requiring privity as a necessary prerequisite to tacking the possession of several occupants. Very few, if any, of the reasons appear in the cases, nor do the cases analyze the relationships that must exist between successive possessors for tacking to be allowed. See W. Stoebuck, The Law of Adverse Possession in Washington in 35 Wash. L. Rev. 53 (1960).</p>
<p id="e0f9cee4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The requirement of privity had its roots in the notion that a succession of trespasses, even though there was no appreciable interval between them, should not, in equity, be allowed to defeat the record title. The “claim of right,” “color of title” requirement of the statutes and cases was probably derived from the early American belief that the squatter should not be able to profit by his trespass.</p>
<p id="e0f9cee5-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, it appears to this court that there is a substantial difference between the squatter or trespasser and the property purchaser, who along with several of his neighbors, as a result of an inaccurate survey or subdivision, occupies and improves property exactly 50 feet to the east of that which a survey some 30 years later demonstrates that they in fact own. It seems to us that there is also a strong public policy favoring early certainty as to the location of land ownership which enters into a proper interpretation of privity.</p>
<p id="e0f9cee6-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the irregular perimeters of Puget Sound exact determination of land locations and boundaries is difficult and expensive. This difficulty is convincingly demonstrated in this case by the problems plaintiff’s engineer encountered in attempting to locate the corners. It cannot be expected that every purchaser will or should engage a surveyor to ascertain that the beach home he is purchasing lies within the boundaries described in his deed. Such a practice is neither reasonable nor customary. Of course, 50-foot errors in descriptions are devastating where a group of adjacent owners each hold 50 feet of waterfront property.</p>
<p id="e0f9f5f7-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The technical requirement of “privity” should not, we think, be used to upset the long periods of occupancy of those who in good faith received an erroneous deed description. Their “claim of right” is no less persuasive than the purchaser who believes he is purchasing <i>more</i> land than his deed described.</p>
<p id="e0f9f5f8-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the final analysis, however, we believe the requirement of “privity” is no more than judicial recognition of the need for some reasonable connection between successive occupants of real property so as to raise their claim of right above the status of the wrongdoer or the trespasser. We think such reasonable connection exists in this case.</p>

<p id="e0f9f5ff-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1.</b> <b><i>Tacking and privity of estate.</i></b> As the court in <i>Howard</i> states, under American law, tacking between successive adverse possessors is usually permitted only when they are in <i>privity of estate</i> with each other. Privity clearly exists where <i>A</i>, who possesses for a period of time less than the statutory period, voluntarily transfers the property to <i>B,</i> who then possesses for a period that, together with that of <i>A</i>, exceeds the statutory period. On the other hand, privity clearly does not exist if <i>A</i> abandons possession after less than the statutory period and <i>B</i> takes over possession. Why should these two situations be treated differently? English common law does not require privity for tacking. Is this the better approach?</p>
<p id="e0f9f600-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Privity in Howard v. Kunto.</i></b> Howard v. Kunto involves a fact situation somewhere between the two extremes described in Note 1: the Kuntos did take possession after receiving a deed, but the deed described land that was not the same as the land they possessed. In what sense, then, was there privity of estate between the Kuntos and their predecessors? Are there good reasons to allow tacking in this situation?</p>
<p id="e0f9f601-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Continuity.</i></b> The requirement of continuity was also at issue in Howard v. Kunto because the Kuntos were in possession only during the summer months. Suppose that instead of building a summer house on “their” lot, the Kuntos and their predecessors had camped every summer on the lot and, being good environmentalists, had left no traces when they removed their camp in the fall. Would this satisfy the requirement of continuity? Compare Ray v. Beacon Hudson Mountain Corp., 666 N.E.2d 532 (N.Y. 1996).</p>
<p id="e0f9f602-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For an argument that adverse possession rules favor economic exploitation of wild lands by permitting successful claims of adverse possession of wild lands to rest on limited, sporadic activities that would not be sufficient for developed lands, see John G. Sprankling, An Environmental Critique of Adverse Possession, 79 Cornell L. Rev. 816 (1994). Inasmuch as strengthening the standard for adverse possession of wild lands might result in claimants inflicting more environmental injury, Professor Sprankling suggests exempting wild lands altogether from adverse possession. See also Alexandra B. Klass, Adverse Possession and Conservation: Expanding Traditional Notions of Use and Possession, 77 U. Colo. L. Rev. 283 (2006).</p>

<p id="e0fa1d20-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Adverse possession against the government</i>. Under the common law rules, adverse possession does not run against the government—local, state, or federal. In England, the maxim <i>nullum tempus occurrit regi</i> (no time runs against the king) barred the running of the statute of limitations against the sovereign. In barring adverse possession against the government, American courts have relied on this rule as well as state constitutional provisions restricting the alienation of state lands. Courts often say, in justification, that the state owns its land in trust for all the people, who should not lose the land because of the negligence of a few state officers or employees.</p>
<p id="e0fa1d21-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A number of states, however, have changed the common law rules, whether by legislation or judge-made law. A few permit adverse possession against government land on the same terms as against private land. Others permit it only if possession continues for a period much longer than that applied in the case of private lands. Still others permit it only against government lands held in a proprietary (as opposed to a public or governmental) capacity. See, e.g., American Trading Real Estate Properties, Inc. v. Town of Trumbull, 574 A.2d 796 (Conn. 1990); Devins v. Borough of Bogota, 592 A.2d 199 (N.J. 1991).</p>

<p id="e0fa1d2a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">P<span class="epub-small-caps">OLLOCK</span>, J. This is an appeal from an order of the Appellate Division granting summary judgment to plaintiff, Georgia O’Keeffe, against defendant, Barry Snyder, d/b/a Princeton Gallery of Fine Arts, for replevin of three small pictures painted by O’Keeffe. In her complaint, filed in March, 1976, O’Keeffe alleged she was the owner of the paintings and that they were stolen from a New York art gallery in 1946. Snyder asserted he was a purchaser for value of the paintings, he had title by adverse possession, and O’Keeffe’s action was barred by the expiration of the six-year period of limitations . . . pertaining to an action in replevin. Snyder impleaded third party defendant, Ulrich A. Frank, from whom Snyder purchased the paintings in 1975 for $35,000.</p>
<p id="e0fa1d2b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court granted summary judgment for Snyder on the ground that O’Keeffe’s action was barred because it was not commenced within six years of the alleged theft. The Appellate Division reversed and entered judgment for O’Keeffe. A majority of that court concluded that the paintings were stolen, the defenses of expiration of the statute of limitations and title by adverse possession were identical, and Snyder had not proved the elements of adverse possession. Consequently, the majority ruled that O’Keeffe could still enforce her right to possession of the paintings.</p>
<p id="e0fa1d2c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . We reverse and remand the matter for a plenary hearing in accordance with this opinion.</p>
<p id="e0fa1d2d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The record, limited to pleadings, affidavits, answers to interrogatories, and depositions, is fraught with factual conflict. Apart from the creation of the paintings by O’Keeffe and their discovery in Snyder’s gallery in 1976, the parties agree on little else.</p>
<p id="e0fa1d2e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">O’Keeffe contended the paintings were stolen in 1946 from a gallery, An American Place. The gallery was operated by her late husband, the famous photographer Alfred Stieglitz.</p>
<p id="e0fa1d2f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An American Place was a cooperative undertaking of O’Keeffe and some other American artists identified by her as Marin, Hardin, Dove, Andema, and Stevens. In 1946, Stieglitz arranged an exhibit which included an O’Keeffe painting, identified as Cliffs. According to O’Keeffe, one day in March, 1946, she and Stieglitz discovered Cliffs was missing from the wall of the exhibit. O’Keeffe estimates the value of the painting at the time of the alleged theft to have been about $150.</p>
<p id="e0fa1d30-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">About two weeks later, O’Keeffe noticed that two other paintings, Seaweed and Fragments, were missing from a storage room at An American Place. She did not tell anyone, even Stieglitz, about the missing paintings, since she did not want to upset him.</p>
<p id="e0fa1d31-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before the date when O’Keeffe discovered the disappearance of Seaweed, she had already sold it (apparently for a string of amber beads) to a Mrs. Weiner, now deceased. Following the grant of the motion for summary judgment by the trial court in favor of Snyder, O’Keeffe submitted a release from the legatees of Mrs. Weiner purportedly assigning to O’Keeffe their interest in the sale.</p>
<p id="e0fa1d32-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">O’Keeffe testified on depositions that at about the same time as the disappearance of her paintings, 12 or 13 miniature paintings by Marin also were stolen from An <span title="153" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-153">p. 153</span>American Place. According to O’Keeffe, a man named Estrick took the Marin paintings and “maybe a few other things.” Estrick distributed the Marin paintings to members of the theater world who, when confronted by Stieglitz, returned them. However, neither Stieglitz nor O’Keeffe confronted Estrick with the loss of any of the O’Keeffe paintings.</p>
<p id="e0fa1d33-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There was no evidence of a break and entry at An American Place on the dates when O’Keeffe discovered the disappearance of her paintings. Neither Stieglitz nor O’Keeffe reported them missing to the New York Police Department or any other law enforcement agency. Apparently the paintings were uninsured, and O’Keeffe did not seek reimbursement from an insurance company. Similarly, neither O’Keeffe nor Stieglitz advertised the loss of the paintings in Art News or any other publication. Nonetheless, they discussed it with associates in the art world and later O’Keeffe mentioned the loss to the director of the Art Institute of Chicago, but she did not ask him to do anything because “it wouldn’t have been my way.” O’Keeffe does not contend that Frank or Snyder had actual knowledge of the alleged theft.</p>
<p id="e0fa1d34-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Stieglitz died in the summer of 1946, and O’Keeffe explains she did not pursue her efforts to locate the paintings because she was settling his estate. In 1947, she retained the services of Doris Bry to help settle the estate. Bry urged O’Keeffe to report the loss of the paintings, but O’Keeffe declined because “they never got anything back by reporting it.” Finally, in 1972, O’Keeffe authorized Bry to report the theft to the Art Dealers Association of America, Inc., which maintains for its members a registry of stolen paintings. The record does not indicate whether such a registry existed at the time the paintings disappeared.</p>
<p id="e0fa1d35-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In September, 1975, O’Keeffe learned that the paintings were in the Andrew Crispo Gallery in New York on consignment from Bernard Danenberg Galleries. On February 11, 1976, O’Keeffe discovered that Ulrich A. Frank had sold the paintings to Barry Snyder, d/b/a Princeton Gallery of Fine Art. She demanded their return and, following Snyder’s refusal, instituted this action for replevin.</p>
<p id="e0fa4446-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Frank traces his possession of the paintings to his father, Dr. Frank, who died in 1968. He claims there is a family relationship by marriage between his family and the Stieglitz family, a contention that O’Keeffe disputes. Frank does not know how his father acquired the paintings, but he recalls seeing them in his father’s apartment in New Hampshire as early as 1941-1943, a period that precedes the alleged theft. Consequently, Frank’s factual contentions are inconsistent with O’Keeffe’s allegation of theft. Until 1965, Dr. Frank occasionally lent the paintings to Ulrich Frank. In 1965, Dr. and Mrs. Frank formally gave the paintings to Ulrich Frank, who kept them in his residences in Yardley, Pennsylvania and Princeton, New Jersey. In 1968, he exhibited anonymously Cliffs and Fragments in a one day art show in the Jewish Community Center in Trenton. All of these events precede O’Keeffe’s listing of the paintings as stolen with the Art Dealers Association of America, Inc. in 1972.</p>
<p id="e0fa4447-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Frank claims continuous possession of the paintings through his father for over thirty years and admits selling the paintings to Snyder. Snyder and Frank do not trace their provenance, or history of possession of the paintings, back to O’Keeffe.</p>
<p id="e0fa4448-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As indicated, Snyder moved for summary judgment on the theory that O’Keeffe’s action was barred by the statute of limitations and title had vested in Frank by adverse possession. For purposes of his motion, Snyder conceded that the paintings had been stolen. On her cross motion, O’Keeffe urged that the paintings were stolen, the statute of limitations had not run, and title to the paintings remained in her. . . . </p>
<span title="154" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-154">p. 154</span>
<p id="e0fa4449-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Appellate Division accepted O’Keeffe’s contention that the paintings had been stolen. However, in his deposition, Ulrich Frank traces possession of the paintings to his father in the early 1940s, a date that precedes the alleged theft by several years. The factual dispute about the loss of the paintings by O’Keeffe and their acquisition by Frank, as well as the other subsequently described factual issues, warrant a remand for a plenary hearing. . . . </p>
<p id="e0fa444a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Without purporting to limit the scope of the trial, other factual issues include whether . . . the paintings were not stolen but sold, lent, consigned, or given by Stieglitz to Dr. Frank or someone else without O’Keeffe’s knowledge before he died; and [whether] there was any business or family relationship between Stieglitz and Dr. Frank so that the original possession of the paintings by the Frank family may have been under claim of right.</p>
<p id="e0fa444b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the limited record before us, we cannot determine now who has title to the paintings.

<p id="e0fa444f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our discussion begins with the principle that, generally speaking, if the paintings were stolen, the thief acquired no title and could not transfer good title to others regardless of their good faith and ignorance of the theft. Proof of theft would advance O’Keeffe’s right to possession of the paintings absent other considerations such as expiration of the statute of limitations.</p>
<p id="e0fa4450-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another issue that may become relevant at trial is whether Frank or his father acquired a “voidable title” to the paintings under N.J.S.A. 12A:2-403(1). That section, part of the Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.),<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN108C0_5ea9c4ba-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N108C0_5ea9c4ba-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">6</a></span> does not change the basic principle that a mere possessor cannot transfer good title. Nonetheless, the U.C.C. permits a person with voidable title to transfer good title to a good faith purchaser for value in certain circumstances. If the facts developed at trial merit application of that section, then Frank may have transferred good title to Snyder, thereby providing a defense to O’Keeffe’s action. . . . </p>
<p id="e0fa445a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On this appeal, the critical legal question is when O’Keeffe’s cause of action accrued. The fulcrum on which the outcome turns is the statute of limitations . . . , which provides that an action for replevin of goods or chattels must be commenced within six years after the accrual of the cause of action.</p>
<p id="e0fa445b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court found that O’Keeffe’s cause of action accrued on the date of the alleged theft, March, 1946, and concluded that her action was barred. The Appellate Division found that an action might have accrued more than six years before the date of suit if possession by the defendant or his predecessors satisfied the elements of adverse possession. As indicated, the Appellate Division concluded that Snyder had not established those elements and that the O’Keeffe action was not barred by the statute of limitations. . . . </p>
<p id="e0fa445c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The purpose of a statute of limitations is to “stimulate to activity and punish negligence” and “promote repose by giving security and stability to human affairs.” Wood v. Carpenter, 101 U.S. 135, 139, 25 L. Ed. 807, 808 (1879). A statute of limitations achieves those purposes by barring a cause of action after the statutory period. In certain instances, this Court has ruled that the literal language of a statute of limitations should yield to other considerations.</p>
<p id="e0fa445d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To avoid harsh results from the mechanical application of the statute, the courts have developed a concept known as the discovery rule. The discovery rule provides <span title="156" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-156">p. 156</span>that, in an appropriate case, a cause of action will not accrue until the injured party discovers, or by exercise of reasonable diligence and intelligence should have discovered, facts which form the basis of a cause of action. The rule is essentially a principle of equity, the purpose of which is to mitigate unjust results that otherwise might flow from strict adherence to a rule of law. . . . </p>
<p id="e0fa445e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[W]e conclude that the discovery rule applies to an action for replevin of a painting. . . . O’Keeffe’s cause of action accrued when she first knew, or reasonably should have known through the exercise of due diligence, of the cause of action, including the identity of the possessor of the paintings. . . . </p>
<p id="e0fa6b6f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In determining whether O’Keeffe is entitled to the benefit of the discovery rule, the trial court should consider, among others, the following issues: (1) whether O’Keeffe used due diligence to recover the paintings at the time of the alleged theft and thereafter; (2) whether at the time of the alleged theft there was an effective method, other than talking to her colleagues, for O’Keeffe to alert the art world; and (3) whether registering paintings with the Art Dealers Association of America, Inc. or any other organization would put a reasonably prudent purchaser of art on constructive notice that someone other than the possessor was the true owner.</p>
<p id="e0fa6b70-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The acquisition of title to real and personal property by adverse possession is based on the expiration of a statute of limitations. . . . </p>
<p id="e0fa6b71-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To establish title by adverse possession to chattels, the rule of law has been that the possession must be hostile, actual, visible, exclusive, and continuous. . . . There is an inherent problem with many kinds of personal property that will raise questions whether their possession has been open, visible, and notorious. . . . For example, if jewelry is stolen from a municipality in one county in New Jersey, it is unlikely that the owner would learn that someone is openly wearing that jewelry in another county or even in the same municipality. Open and visible possession of personal property, such as jewelry, may not be sufficient to put the original owner on actual or constructive notice of the identity of the possessor.</p>
<p id="e0fa6b72-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The problem is even more acute with works of art. Like many kinds of personal property, works of art are readily moved and easily concealed. O’Keeffe argues that nothing short of public display should be sufficient to alert the true owner and start the statute running. Although there is merit in that contention from the perspective of the original owner, the effect is to impose a heavy burden on the purchasers of paintings who wish to enjoy the paintings in the privacy of their homes. . . . </p>
<p id="e0fa6b73-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The problem is serious. According to an affidavit submitted in this matter by the president of the International Foundation for Art Research, there has been an “explosion in art thefts” and there is a “worldwide phenomenon of art theft which has reached epidemic proportions.”</p>
<p id="e0fa6b74-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The limited record before us provides a brief glimpse into the arcane world of sales of art, where paintings worth vast sums of money sometimes are bought without inquiry about their provenance. There does not appear to be a reasonably available method for an owner of art to record the ownership or theft of paintings. Similarly, there are no reasonable means readily available to a purchaser to ascertain the provenance of a painting. It may be time for the art world to establish a means by which a good faith purchaser may reasonably obtain the provenance of a painting. An efficient registry of original works of art might better serve the interests of artists, owners of art, and bona fide purchasers than the law of adverse possession with all of its uncertainties. <span title="157" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-157">p. 157</span>Although we cannot mandate the initiation of a registration system, we can develop a rule for the commencement and running of the statute of limitations that is more responsive to the needs of the art world than the doctrine of adverse possession.</p>
<p id="e0fa6b75-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are persuaded that the introduction of equitable considerations through the discovery rule provides a more satisfactory response than the doctrine of adverse possession. The discovery rule shifts the emphasis from the conduct of the possessor to the conduct of the owner. The focus of the inquiry will no longer be whether the possessor has met the tests of adverse possession, but whether the owner has acted with due diligence in pursuing his or her personal property.</p>
<p id="e0fa6b76-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, under the discovery rule, if an artist diligently seeks the recovery of a lost or stolen painting, but cannot find it or discover the identity of the possessor, the statute of limitations will not begin to run. The rule permits an artist who uses reasonable efforts to report, investigate, and recover a painting to preserve the rights of title and possession.</p>
<p id="e0fa6b77-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Properly interpreted, the discovery rule becomes a vehicle for transporting equitable considerations into the statute of limitations for replevin. . . . </p>
<p id="e0fa6b78-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is consistent also with the law of replevin as it has developed apart from the discovery rule. In an action for replevin, the period of limitations ordinarily will run against the owner of lost or stolen property from the time of the wrongful taking, absent fraud or concealment. Where the chattel is fraudulently concealed, the general rule is that the statute is tolled. . . . </p>
<p id="e0fa6b79-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A purchaser from a private party would be well-advised to inquire whether a work of art has been reported as lost or stolen. However, a bona fide purchaser who purchases in the ordinary course of business a painting entrusted to an art dealer should be able to acquire good title against the true owner. Under the U.C.C. entrusting possession of goods to a merchant who deals in that kind of goods gives the merchant the power to transfer all the rights of the entruster to a buyer in the ordinary course of business. In a transaction under that statute, a merchant may vest good title in the buyer as against the original owner. The interplay between the statute of limitations as modified by the discovery rule and the U.C.C. should encourage good faith purchases from legitimate art dealers and discourage trafficking in stolen art without frustrating an artist’s ability to recover stolen art works.</p>
<p id="e0fa6b7a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The discovery rule will fulfill the purposes of a statute of limitations and accord greater protection to the innocent owner of personal property whose goods are lost or stolen. . . . </p>
<p id="e0fa6b7b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By diligently pursuing their goods, owners may prevent the statute of limitations from running. The meaning of due diligence will vary with the facts of each case, including the nature and value of the personal property. For example, with respect to jewelry of moderate value, it may be sufficient if the owner reports the theft to the police. With respect to art work of greater value, it may be reasonable to expect an owner to do more. In practice, our ruling should contribute to more careful practices concerning the purchase of art.</p>
<p id="e0fa6b7c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The considerations are different with real estate, and there is no reason to disturb the application of the doctrine of adverse possession to real estate. Real estate is fixed and cannot be moved or concealed. The owner of real property knows or should know where his property is located and reasonably can be expected to be aware of open, notorious, visible, hostile, continuous acts of possession on it.</p>

<p id="e0fa6b7d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our ruling not only changes the requirements for acquiring title to personal property after an alleged unlawful taking, but also shifts the burden of proof at trial. Under the doctrine of adverse possession, the burden is on the possessor to prove the elements of adverse possession. Under the discovery rule, the burden is on the owner as the one seeking the benefit of the rule to establish facts that would justify deferring the beginning of the period of limitations. . . . </p>

<p id="e0fa9290-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Georgia O’Keeffe grew up in the rural Midwest. After studying art in Chicago and New York, she decided to paint shapes that, she claimed, were “in [her] head.” In 1915, she sent some of her drawings—of budding and organic shapes, reflecting an intense feminine sensibility—to a friend in New York, admonishing her to show them to no one. The friend, disregarding O’Keeffe’s wishes, showed them to Alfred Stieglitz, the noted New York photographer and gallery owner. Upon seeing the drawings, Stieglitz remarked, “At last, a woman on paper,” and promptly displayed them in his gallery. When, shortly thereafter, O’Keeffe came to New York and learned of this, she was furious. She rushed to the gallery and demanded that her private work be taken down. Stieglitz refused, and the paintings remained. Stieglitz, obsessed with this woman 20 years his junior, soon left his wife and daughter and moved in with her. “He photographed me until I was crazy,” O’Keeffe recalled in her nineties. He photographed every square inch of O’Keeffe nude, then exhibited the pictures in a show, creating a scandal and bringing O’Keeffe instant fame.</p>
<p id="e0fa9291-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">O’Keeffe and Stieglitz married in 1924. When, a few years later, Stieglitz entered into a liaison with a woman half O’Keeffe’s age, and put her in charge of his gallery, O’Keeffe found that New Mexico was where she belonged, but she could not leave Stieglitz. She returned to New York every fall to renew her bond with him. When Stieglitz died in 1946, at age 82, O’Keeffe moved to New Mexico for good. She died in 1986 at age 99.</p>

<p id="e0fa9292-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Read literally, the effect of the expiration of the statute of limitations . . . is to bar an action such as replevin. The statute does not speak of divesting the original owner of title. By its terms the statute cuts off the remedy, but not the right of title. Nonetheless, the effect of the expiration of the statute of limitations, albeit on the theory of adverse possession, has been not only to bar an action for possession, but also to vest title in the possessor. There is no reason to change that result although the discovery rule has replaced adverse possession. History, reason, and common sense support the conclusion that the expiration of the statute of limitations bars the remedy to recover possession and also vests title in the possessor. . . . Before the expiration of the statute, the possessor has both the chattel and the right to keep it except as against the true owner. The only imperfection in the possessor’s right to retain the chattel is the original owner’s right to repossess it. Once that imperfection is removed, the possessor should have good title for all purposes. . . . </p>
<p id="e0fa9293-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We next consider the effect of transfers of a chattel from one possessor to another during the period of limitation under the discovery rule. Under the discovery rule, the statute of limitations on an action for replevin begins to run when the owner knows or reasonably should know of his cause of action and the identity of the possessor of the chattel. Subsequent transfers of the chattel are part of the continuous dispossession of the chattel from the original owner. The important point is not that there has been a substitution of possessors, but that there has been a continuous dispossession of the former owner. . . . </p>
<p id="e0fa9294-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the purpose of evaluating the due diligence of an owner, the dispossession of his chattel is a continuum not susceptible to separation into distinct acts. Nonetheless, subsequent transfers of the chattel may affect the degree of difficulty encountered by a diligent owner seeking to recover his goods. To that extent, subsequent transfers and their potential for frustrating diligence are relevant in applying the discovery rule. An owner who diligently seeks his chattel should be entitled to the benefit of the discovery rule although it may have passed through many hands. Conversely an owner who sleeps on his rights may be denied the benefit of the discovery rule although the chattel may have been possessed by only one person.</p>

<p id="e0fab8b1-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Three rules.</i></b> Various courts have developed at least three different rules regarding the time when the statute of limitations begins to run for purposes of adverse possession of personal property:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="e0fab8b2-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The conversion rule</i>. This is the simplest rule and the one most closely tied to the statute of limitations itself. According to this rule, the statute begins to rule against the true owner as soon as the property is converted. This is the rule that the trial court in <i>O’Keeffe</i> applied.</p></li>
<li><p id="e0fab8b3-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The discovery rule</i>. According to this rule, the cause of action for conversion does not accrue, triggering the running of the statute of limitations, until the owner “discovers, or by exercise of reasonable diligence and intelligence should have discovered, facts which form the basis of a cause of action.” <i>O’Keeffe</i>, 416 A.2d at 869. This is the rule that the New Jersey Supreme Court in <i>O’Keeffe</i> adopted. As a general matter, it gives the owner a longer interval of time to recover the property than the conversion rule.</p></li>
<li><p id="e0fab8b4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The demand rule</i>. Under this rule, the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the true owner makes a demand for the return of the property and the demand is refused. The New York Court of Appeals adopted the demand rule in Solomon R. Guggenheim Found. v. Lubell, 569 N.E.2d 426 (N.Y. 1991).</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="e0fadfc5-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Which of these three rules is most protective of the true owner? In <i>Guggenheim</i>, the court stated that it rejected the discovery rule on the ground that it provides insufficient protection for owners of stolen artwork (New York is probably the site of most purchases of major works of art in the United States). Should protection of good-faith purchasers of stolen goods be the primary objective of this area of adverse possession law?</p>
<p id="e0fadfc6-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Applying the discovery rule to O’Keeffe.</i></b> According to the court in <i>O’Keeffe</i>, under the discovery rule “the focus of the inquiry [is] whether the owner has acted with due diligence in pursuing his or her personal property.” Will Georgia O’Keeffe likely be able to satisfy that requirement?</p>
<p id="e0fadfc7-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>U.C.C. §2-403.</i></b> The court in <i>O’Keeffe</i> stated that upon remand, one issue will be whether Frank or his father had <i>voidable title</i> to the paintings under U.C.C. §2-403. It is important to distinguish between <i>voidable</i> title and <i>void</i> title. The <i>void title rule</i> is that if a person acquires possession of a good where the true owner did not intend to transfer title to the good, then the possessor acquires no title to that good and cannot transfer good title to it to anyone else. Title that was void in the transferor’s hands is void in the transferee’s hands as well. So, a thief, for example, has void title. <i>Voidable title</i> is an exception to this rule. Voidable title exists where the true owner intends to transfer the good, even though transfer of possession was procured through fraud or misrepresentation. Unlike void title, with voidable title delivery is voluntary. Voidable title is a defective title, but it is a title that, although the true owner can rescind, becomes a good title if transferred to a good-faith purchaser for value. The idea is not simply to protect innocent parties, but to protect commercial transactions, which depend upon the ability of innocent purchasers to rely upon the apparently good title of their sellers. U.C.C. §2-403(1), reprinted in full in footnote 6 on page 155 supra, provides four <span title="161" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-161">p. 161</span>specific circumstances for the creation of voidable title. For example, suppose that <i>O</i> sells a Georgia O’Keeffe painting that <i>O</i> owns for $150,000 to <i>A</i>. <i>A</i> hands <i>O</i> a check for that amount, and then sells the painting to <i>B</i> for $200,000. However, <i>A</i>’s bank account is insufficient to cover the amount of the check, and the check bounces. Under U.C.C. §2-403(1)(b), <i>B</i> owns the painting. <i>A</i> had voidable title, giving him the power to transfer good title to <i>B</i>, a good-faith purchaser.</p>
<p id="e0fadfc8-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another issue on remand will be whether O’Keeffe “entrusted” the paintings to a “merchant who deals in goods of that kind.” U.C.C. §2-403(2). The UCC defines “entrusting” as any delivery “regardless of any condition expressed between the parties to the delivery” and regardless of the fact that the procurement of the entrusting or the possessor’s disposition of the goods may have been larcenous. Suppose that it turns out that O’Keefe gave the paintings to Stieglitz for safekeeping and that Stieglitz sold them to Frank’s father without O’Keeffe’s consent. Who would prevail under §2-403?</p>

<p id="e0fadfcb-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To complete our study of possession, we turn to gifts of personal property, where, as we shall see, possession plays a very important role. There are three requirements for a gift:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="e0fadfcc-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>intent</i>,</p></li>
<li><p id="e0fadfcd-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>delivery</i>, and</p></li>
<li><p id="e0fadfce-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>acceptance.</i></p></li>
</ul>
<p id="e0fadfcf-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Intent</i>—The donor must intend to make a present transfer of an existing interest in the property. That is, the donor must intend to be legally bound now, not in the future. Intent is commonly a problem in litigated gift cases.</p>
<p id="e0fadfd0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Delivery—</i>The law has long required that, to make a gift of personal property, the donor must transfer possession (“hand over the property”) to the donee with the manifested intention to make a gift to the donee. Delivery and intent interact and overlap with each other to a considerable degree, but they are discrete requirements nevertheless. Both must be present.</p>
<p id="e0fadfd1-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Acceptance</i>—Acceptance by the donee is also required but seldom an issue. Courts presume acceptance upon delivery, unless a donee expressly refuses a gift. Intention to make a gift may be shown by oral evidence; delivery requires objective acts.</p>
<p id="e0fadfd2-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>More on delivery</i>. The requirement of transfer of possession is feudal in origin. In feudal times, when few could read or write, a symbolic ceremony transferring possession was an important ritual signifying the transfer. Land could be transferred only by delivering a clod of dirt or a branch to the grantee on the land itself. The ceremony was called “livery of seisin” (see page 189); chattels had to be handed over. In 1677, the Statute of Frauds abolished livery of seisin and initiated the requirement of a deed to pass title to land. However, the visual ceremony of transferring possession still survives if the object transferred is on top of the land. In a famous article, Professor Mechem suggested the following reasons for the survival of the delivery requirement in gifts of personal property:</p>

<p id="e0fb06e3-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">1. Handing over the object makes vivid and concrete to the donor the significance of the act performed. By feeling the “wrench of delivery,” the donor realizes an irrevocable gift has been made.</p>

<li><p id="e0fb06ea-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Symbolic delivery</i>. Symbolic delivery occurs when the donor physically transfers to the donee an object that represents or symbolizes the subject matter of the gift. This includes a writing. Most jurisdictions recognize symbolic delivery. Traditionally, symbolic delivery is permitted only if manual delivery is not feasible, but the modern trend is to permit it even when manual delivery is possible.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p id="e0fb06eb-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If manual delivery is not practicable because of the size or weight of the object, or its inaccessibility, constructive or symbolic delivery may be permitted. <i>Constructive</i> delivery is handing over a key or some object that will open up access to the subject matter of the gift. <i>Symbolic</i> delivery is handing over something symbolic of the property given. The usual case of symbolic delivery involves handing over a written instrument declaring a gift of the subject matter; for example, Joe hands to Marilyn a paper reading, “I give my grand piano to Marilyn. s/ Joe.” The traditional rule of gifts is: If an object can be handed over, it must be. But there are indications that the rule is eroding. For example, one court found valid <i>constructive</i> delivery where a donor who had received a check from another endorsed the check in blank and put it on a table in her apartment, which she shared with the donee, along with a note giving the check to the donee, and then left with the intention of committing suicide (which she did). Scherer v. Hyland, 380 A.2d 698 (N.J. 1977). Under the traditional rule, constructive delivery would not be recognized here. (Do you see why?) However, the court stated that it would find a constructive delivery adequate “when the evidence of donative intent is concrete and undisputed, when there is every indication that the donor intended to make a present transfer of the subject-matter of the gift, and when the steps taken by the donor to effect such a transfer must have been deemed by the donor as sufficient to pass the donor’s interest to the donee.”</p>
<p id="e0fb06ec-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The restriction on <i>symbolic</i> delivery has also been relaxed somewhat. Some states have statutes providing that symbolic delivery by a writing is always permitted. E.g., Cal. Civ. Code §1147 (West 2016).</p>
<p id="e0fb06ed-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With only three requirements, gift law is beguilingly simple, and we shall see that the requirements of donative intent and delivery are far more complex than meets the eye.

He moved there in 1859 and entered the grocery business. When the Civil War broke out, his partner joined the Confederate army, and Van Pelt stayed at home to run their business. He was mayor of the town from 1873 to 1877 and from 1883 to 1885. He was also manager of Statesville’s Opera Hall.</p>

(In the Walnut Street house was a piano, which the plaintiff, Julia Newman, claimed had been given her and on which Van Pelt had collected the fire insurance proceeds.) Van Pelt died intestate (that is, without a will). His heirs were a sister living in China Grove, North Carolina, and a brother living in Alabama.</p>

<p id="e0fb552b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To constitute a donatio causa mortis, two things are indispensably necessary: an intention to make the gift, and a delivery of the thing given. Without both of these requisites, there can be no gift causa mortis. And both these are matters of fact to be determined by the jury, where there is evidence tending to prove them. The intention to make the gift need not be announced by the donor in express terms, but may be inferred from the facts attending the delivery—that is, what the donor said and did. But it must always clearly appear that he knew <i>what he was doing</i>, and that he intended a gift. So far, there was but little diversity of authority, if any.</p>
<p id="e0fb552c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As to what constitutes or may constitute delivery, has been the subject of discussion and adjudication in most or all the courts of the Union and of England, and they have by no means been uniform—some of them holding that a symbolical delivery—that is, some other article delivered in the name and stead of the thing intended to be given, is sufficient; others holding that a symbolical delivery is not sufficient, but that a constructive delivery, that is, the delivery of a key to a locked house, trunk or other receptacle is sufficient. They distinguish this from a symbolical delivery, and say that this is in <i>substance</i> a delivery of the thing, as it is the means of using and enjoying the thing given; while others hold that there must be an actual manual delivery to perfect a gift causa mortis.</p>
<p id="e0fb552d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This doctrine of donatio causa mortis was borrowed from the Roman Civil Law by our English ancestors. There was much greater need for such a law at the time it was incorporated into the civil law and into the English law than there is now. Learning was not so general, nor the facilities for making wills so great then as now. . . . </p>
<p id="e0fb552e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It seems to us that, . . . after the statute of fraud and of wills, this doctrine of causa mortis is in direct conflict with the spirit and purpose of those statutes—the prevention of fraud. It is a doctrine, in our opinion, not to be extended but to be strictly construed and confined within the bounds of our adjudged cases. We were at first disposed to confine it to cases of actual <i>manual</i> delivery, and are only prevented from doing so by our loyalty to our own adjudications. . . . </p>
<p id="e0fb552f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many of the cases cited by the plaintiff are distinguishable from ours, if not all of them. Thomas v. Lewis (a Virginia case), 37 Am. St., 878, was probably more relied on by the plaintiff than any other case cited, and for that reason we mention it by name. This case, in its essential facts, is distinguishable from the case under consideration. There, the articles present were taken out of the bureau drawer, handed to the donor, and then delivered by him to the donee. According to all the authorities, this was a good gift causa mortis. The box and safe, the key to which the donor delivered to the donee, were not present but were deposited in the vault of the bank; and so far as shown by the case it will be presumed, from the place where they were and the purpose for which things are usually deposited in a bank vault, that they were only valuable as a depository for such purposes, as holding and preserving money and valuable papers, bonds, stocks and the like. This box and safe would have been of little value to the donee for any other purpose. But more than this, the donor expressly stated that all you find <i>in this box and this safe is yours</i>. There is no mistake that it was the intention of the donor to give what was contained in the box and in the safe.</p>

<p id="e0fb5530-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As my Lord Coke would say: “Note the diversity” between that case and the case at bar. There, the evidence of debt contained in the bureau, which was present, was taken out, given to the donor, and by him delivered to the donee. This was an actual manual delivery, good under all the authorities. But no such thing was done in this case as to the life insurance policy. It was neither taken out of the drawer nor mentioned by the donor, unless it is included in the testimony of Enos Houston who, at one time, in giving his testimony says that Van Pelt gave her the keys, saying “what is in this house is yours,” and at another time on cross-examination, he said to Julia, “I intend to give you this furniture in this house,” and at another time, “What property is in this house is yours.” The bureau in which was found the life insurance policy, after the death of Van Pelt, was present in the room where the keys were handed to Julia, and the life insurance policy could easily have been taken out and handed to Van Pelt, and by him delivered to Julia, as was done in the case of Thomas v. Lewis, supra. But this was not done. The safe and box, in Thomas v. Lewis, were not present, so that the contents could not have been taken out and delivered to the donee by the donor. The ordinary use of a stand of bureaus is not for the purpose of holding and securing such things as a life insurance policy, though they may be often used for that purpose, while a safe and a box deposited in the vault of a bank are. A bureau is an article of household furniture, used for domestic purposes, and generally belongs to the ladies’ department of the household government, while the safe and box, in Thomas v. Lewis, are not. The bureau itself, mentioned in this case, was such property as would be valuable to the plaintiff. . . . </p>

<p id="e0fb5533-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Following this case, . . . we feel bound to give effect to <i>constructive delivery</i>, where it plainly appears that it was the intention of the donor to make the gift, and where the things intended to be given are <i>not</i> present, or, where present, are incapable of <i>manual</i> delivery from their size or weight. But where the articles are present and are capable of manual delivery, <i>this must be had</i>. This is as far as we can go. It may be thought by some that this is a hard rule—that a dying man cannot dispose of his own. But we are satisfied that when properly considered, it will be found to be a just rule. But it is not a hard rule. The law provides how a man can dispose of all his property, both real and personal. To do this, it is only necessary for him to observe and conform to the requirements of these laws. . . . The law provides that every man may dispose of all of his property by will, when made in writing. And it is most singular how guarded the law is to protect the testator against fraud and impositions by requiring that every word of the will must be written and signed by the testator, or, if written by someone else, it must be attested by at least <i>two</i> subscribing witnesses who shall sign the same in his presence and at his request, or the will is void. . . . </p>
<p id="e0fb5534-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In gifts causa mortis it requires but one witness, probably one servant as a witness to a gift of all the estate a man has; no publicity is to be given that the gift has been made, and no probate or registration is required.</p>
<p id="e0fb5535-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statute of wills is a statute against fraud, considered in England and in this State to be demanded by public policy. And yet, if symbolical deliveries of gifts causa mortis are to be allowed, or if constructive deliveries be allowed to the extent claimed by the plaintiff, the statute of wills may prove to be of little value. For such considerations, we <span title="168" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-168">p. 168</span>see every reason for restricting and none for extending the rules heretofore established as applicable to gifts causa mortis.</p>
<p id="e0fb5536-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It being claimed and admitted that the life insurance policy was present in the bureau drawer in the room where it is claimed the gift was made, and being capable of actual manual delivery, we are of the opinion that the title of the insurance policy did not pass to the plaintiff, but remained the property of the intestate of the defendant.</p>
<p id="e0fb5537-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But we are of the opinion that the bureau and any other article of furniture, locked and unlocked by any of the keys given to the plaintiff, did pass and she became the owner thereof. This is upon the ground that while these articles were present, from their size and weight they were incapable of actual manual delivery; and that the delivery of the keys was a constructive delivery of these articles, equivalent to an actual delivery if the articles had been capable of manual delivery.</p>

But as to the furniture in the plaintiff’s bedroom ($45) it seems to us that there was sufficient evidence of both gift and delivery to support the finding of the jury, as a gift inter vivos. The intention to give this property is shown by a number of witnesses and contradicted by none.</p>

<p id="e0fb7c4d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The only debatable ground is as to the sufficiency of the delivery. But when we recall the express terms in which he repeatedly declared that it was hers; that he had bought it for her and had given it to her; that it was placed in her private chamber, her bedroom, where we must suppose that she had the entire use and control of the same, it would seem that this was sufficient to constitute a delivery. There was no evidence, that we remember, disputing these facts. But, if there was, the jury have found for the plaintiff, upon sufficient evidence at least to go to the jury, as to this gift and its delivery. As to the piano there was much evidence tending to show the intention of Van Pelt to give it to the plaintiff, and that he had given it to her, and we <span title="169" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-169">p. 169</span>remember no evidence to the contrary. And as to this, like the bedroom furniture, the debatable ground, if there is any debatable ground, is the question of delivery. It was placed in the intestate’s parlor where it remained until it was burned. The intestate insured it as his property, collected and used the insurance money as his own, often saying that he intended to buy the plaintiff another piano, which he never did. It must be presumed that the parlor was under the dominion of the intestate, and not of his cook, housekeeper, and hired servant. And unless there is something more shown than the fact that the piano was bought by the intestate, placed in his parlor, and called by him “Miss Julia’s piano,” we cannot think this constituted a delivery. But, as the case goes back for a new trial, if the plaintiff thinks she can show a delivery she will have an opportunity of doing so. But she will understand that she must do so according to the rules laid down in this opinion—that she must show actual or constructive delivery equivalent to actual manual delivery. We see no ground upon which the plaintiff can recover the insurance money, if the piano was not hers.</p>
<p id="e0fb7c4e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not understand that there was any controversy as to the plaintiff’s right to recover her services, which the jury have estimated to be $125. The view of the case we have taken has relieved us from a discussion of the exceptions to evidence, and as to the charge of the Court. There is no such thing in this State as <i>symbolical delivery</i> in gifts either inter vivos or causa mortis. . . . </p>

<p id="e0fb7c52-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Gifts</i> causa mortis<i>.</i> In Newman v. Bost, some of the alleged gifts were gifts <i>causa mortis</i> (the term the court used, <i>donatio causa mortis</i>, is synonymous). A gift <i>causa mortis</i> (Latin for “on the occasion of death”) is a gift made in contemplation of and in expectation of immediately approaching death. Gifts <i>causa mortis</i> are presumed to be revocable. Under the modern view, if the donor survives without revoking the gift within a reasonable time after the donor is no longer in apprehension of imminent death, the power of revocation terminates. See Restatement (Third) of Property, Wills and Other Donative Transfers §6.2 comment zz. However, older authority has held that the donor’s recovery automatically revokes the gift.</p>
<p id="e0fba363-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to some modern cases, the “contemplation of death” requirement is met even where the donor intended to commit suicide. E.g., In re Estate of Smith, 694 A.2d 1099 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1997); Scherer v. Hyland, 380 A.2d 698 (N.J. 1977). Older cases widely held otherwise on the ground that suicide was against public policy. The court in Scherer v. Hyland, a leading decision, explains the modern view: “[D]eath is no less impending because of the resolve to commit suicide. Nor does that fixed purpose constitute any lesser or less imminent peril than does a ravaging disease.” Id. at 702.</p>
<p id="e0fba364-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the courts see upholding gifts <i>causa mortis</i> as undercutting the safeguards of the Statute of Wills, traditionally they have more strictly applied the requirements for a valid gift <i>causa mortis</i> than for a gift inter vivos. They also have placed restrictions on gifts <i>causa mortis</i> not applicable to inter vivos gifts. For example, if the donee already is in possession of the property, there must be a redelivery to effect a valid gift <i>causa mortis,</i> but not if the gift is inter vivos. If, <span title="170" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-170">p. 170</span>in <i>Newman</i>, Van Pelt had put a small cinnabar box in Julia’s bedroom, he could during his lifetime, before death drew near, declare that he was giving the box to Julia. But if he waited until he was on his deathbed, he would have to deliver the box to her again.</p>
<p id="e0fba365-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given changes in the law of wills, the strict approach to gifts <i>causa mortis</i> may no longer be justified. The modern trend is to enforce the decedent’s intent even if there is evidence of some failure to comply with the wills act formalities<b>,</b> so long as there is clear and convincing evidence of donative intent. See, e.g., Uniform Probate Code §2-503 (2008).</p>

Plaintiff commenced this action seeking a declaration that he is the rightful owner of a painting which he alleges his father, now deceased, gave to him. He concedes that he has never had possession of the painting but asserts that his father made a valid gift of the title in 1963 reserving a life estate for himself. His father retained possession of the painting until he died in 1980. Defendant, plaintiff’s stepmother, has the painting now and has refused plaintiff’s requests that she turn it over to him. She contends that the purported gift was testamentary in nature and invalid insofar as the formalities of a will were not met or, alternatively, that a donor may not make a valid inter vivos gift of a chattel and retain a life estate with a complete right of <span title="171" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-171">p. 171</span>possession. Following a seven-day nonjury trial, Special Term found that plaintiff had failed to establish any of the elements of an inter vivos gift and that in any event an attempt by a donor to retain a present possessory life estate in a chattel invalidated a purported gift of it. The Appellate Division held that a valid gift may be made reserving a life estate and, finding the elements of a gift established in this case, it reversed and remitted the matter for a determination of value (104 A.D.2d 171, 488 N.Y.S.2d 401). That determination has now been made and defendant appeals directly to this court, pursuant to CPLR 5601(d), from the subsequent final judgment entered in Supreme Court awarding plaintiff $2,500,000 in damages representing the value of the painting, plus interest.

<p id="e0fbca84-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Gustav Klimt (1862-1918) was one of the founders of the Vienna Secession, a group of young fin-de-siècle Viennese artists who sought to liberate Viennese art from the dominance of naturalist style, opening it to such contemporary European influences as <i>art nouveau</i>. He created many murals for public buildings, both in Vienna and elsewhere, but perhaps his greatest fame was as a painter of portraits and landscapes that exhibited an exotic and often erotic style. See Gerbert Frodl, Klimt (Alexandra Campbell trans.1990). In 2006, a Klimt painting, <i>Adele Block-Bauer I,</i> was purchased by cosmetics magnate Ronald S. Lauder for $135 million. It was at the time the highest sum ever paid for a painting. The work purchased by Lauder had been the subject of an extensive restitution battle between the Austrian government and a niece of Ms. Block-Bauer, who contended, successfully, that the Nazis had stolen the painting and four other Klimt works during World War II.</p>
<p id="e0fbca85-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Schloss Kammer, the subject of the painting in dispute, was Klimt’s favorite vacation spot. It is located in the Salzkammergut, a beautiful lake district outside of Salzburg, Austria. We owe this information to Professor Susan French, who has told the whole (and fascinating) story of the case in her essay, Susan F. French, <i>Gruen v. Gruen</i>: A Tale of Two Stories<i>,</i> in Property Stories 75 (Gerald Korngold &amp; Andrew P. Morriss eds. 2d ed. 2009).</p>
</div>
<p id="e0fbca86-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The subject of the dispute is a work entitled “Schloss Kammer am Attersee II” painted by a noted Austrian modernist, Gustav Klimt. It was purchased by plaintiff’s father, Victor Gruen, in 1959 for $8,000. On April 1, 1963 the elder Gruen, a successful architect with offices and residences in both New York City and Los Angeles during most of the time involved in this action, wrote a letter to plaintiff, then an undergraduate student at Harvard, stating that he was giving him the Klimt painting for his birthday but that he wished to retain the possession of it for his lifetime. This letter is not in evidence, apparently because plaintiff destroyed it on instructions from his father. Two other letters were received, however, one dated May 22, 1963 and the other April 1, 1963. Both had been dictated by Victor Gruen and sent together to plaintiff on or about May 22, 1963. The letter dated May 22, 1963 reads as follows:</p>

<p id="e0fbf1a5-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Victor Gruen, born in Vienna, was an urban designer and architect who came to this country in 1933. His firm, Victor Gruen Associates, has been one of the most influential in shaping the urban environment since World War II. It designed the first regional shopping center, Northland, near Detroit, which inspired similar plans for enormous enclosed shopping malls in other cities. Gruen was the author of several books on urban planning, in which he said his main aim was to design cities that were worthwhile to live in as well as functional. “Some say there is no need for a city, a center,” Gruen once said. “They say you can communicate in the future with television phones. You may be able eventually to talk to your girlfriend by television, but you can’t kiss her that way.” His best book is The Heart of Our Cities (1964).</p>
<p id="e0fbf1a6-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Gruen viewed Vienna as the most livable of cities, largely because the automobile—which he disliked—had been banned from downtown. In the last years of his life, he returned to live in Vienna, where he died in 1980. See generally M. Jeffrey Hardwick, Mall Maker: Victor Gruen, Architect of an American Dream (2003).</p>

<p id="e0fbf1a7-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issues framed for appeal are whether a valid inter vivos gift of a chattel may be made where the donor has reserved a life estate in the chattel and the donee never has had physical possession of it before the donor’s death and, if it may, which factual findings on the elements of a valid inter vivos gift more nearly comport with the weight of the evidence in this case, those of Special Term or those of the Appellate Division. The latter issue requires application of two general rules. First, to make a valid inter vivos gift there must exist the intent on the part of the donor to make a present transfer; delivery of the gift, either actual or constructive to the donee; and acceptance by the donee (Matter of Szabo, 10 N.Y.2d 94, 98, 217 N.Y.S.2d 593, 176 N.E.2d 395; Matter of Kelly, 285 N.Y. 139, 150, 33 N.E.2d 62 [dissenting in part opn.]).

<p id="e0fc18b9-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is an important distinction between the intent with which an inter vivos gift is made and the intent to make a gift by will. An inter vivos gift requires that the donor intend to make an irrevocable present transfer of ownership; if the intention is to make a testamentary disposition effective only after death, the gift is invalid unless made by will.</p>

The evidence is all but conclusive, however, that Victor intended to transfer ownership of the painting to plaintiff in 1963 but to retain a life estate in it and that he did, therefore, effectively transfer a remainder interest in the painting to plaintiff at that time. Although the original letter was not in evidence, testimony of its contents was received along with the substitute gift letter and its covering letter dated May 22, 1963.

<p id="e0fc18be-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Brandreth, 169 N.Y. 437, 440, 62 N.E. 563) and when they are they unambiguously establish that Victor Gruen intended to make a present gift of title to the painting at that time. But there was other evidence for after 1963 Victor made several statements orally and in writing indicating that he had previously given plaintiff the painting and that plaintiff owned it. Victor Gruen retained possession of the property, insured it, allowed others to exhibit it and made necessary repairs to it but those acts are not inconsistent with his retention of a life estate. . . . Victor’s failure to file a gift tax return on the transaction was partially explained by allegedly erroneous legal advice he received, and while that omission sometimes may indicate that the donor had no intention of making a present gift, it does not necessarily do so and it is not dispositive in this case.</p>
<p id="e0fc18bf-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant contends that even if a present gift was intended, Victor’s reservation of a lifetime interest in the painting defeated it. . . . </p>
<p id="e0fc18c0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant recognizes that a valid inter vivos gift of a remainder interest can be made not only of real property but also of such intangibles as stocks and bonds. Indeed, several of the cases she cites so hold. That being so, it is difficult to perceive any legal basis for the distinction she urges which would permit gifts of remainder interests in those properties but not of remainder interests in chattels such as the Klimt painting here. The only reason suggested is that the gift of a chattel must include a present right to possession. The application of <i>Brandreth</i> to permit a gift of the remainder in this case, however, is consistent with the distinction, well recognized in the law of gifts as well as in real property law, between ownership and possession or enjoyment. Insofar as some of our cases purport to require that the donor intend to transfer both title and possession immediately to have a valid inter vivos gift (see Gannon v. McGuire, 160 N.Y. 476, 481, 55 N.E. 7; Young v. Young, 80 N.Y. 422, 430), they state the rule too broadly and confuse the effectiveness of a gift with the transfer of the possession of the subject of that gift. The correct test is “‘whether the maker intended the [gift] to have <i>no effect</i> until after the maker’s death, or whether he intended it to transfer <i>some present interest</i>”’ (McCarthy v. Pieret, 281 N.Y. 407, 409, 24 N.E.2d 102 [emphasis added]; see also 25 N.Y. Jur., Gifts, §14, at 156-157). As long as the evidence establishes an intent to make a present and irrevocable transfer of title or the right of ownership, there is a present transfer of some interest and the gift is effective immediately. Thus, in Speelman v. Pascal, [10 N.Y.2d 313, 222 N.Y.S.2d 324, 178 N.E.2d 723], we held valid a gift of a percentage of the future royalties to the play “My Fair Lady” before the play even existed. There, as in this case, the donee received title or the right of ownership to some property immediately upon the making of the gift but possession or enjoyment of the subject of the gift was postponed to some future time.</p>
<p id="e0fc18c1-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant suggests that allowing a donor to make a present gift of a remainder with the reservation of a life estate will lead courts to effectuate otherwise invalid testamentary dispositions of property. The two have entirely different characteristics, however, which make them distinguishable. Once the gift is made it is irrevocable and the donor is limited to the rights of a life tenant not an owner. Moreover, with the gift of a remainder title vests immediately in the donee and any possession is postponed until the donor’s death whereas under a will neither title nor possession vests immediately. Finally, the postponement of enjoyment of the gift is produced by the express terms of the gift not by the nature of the instrument as it is with a will (see Robb v. Washington &amp; Jefferson Coll., 185 N.Y. 485, 493, 78 N.E. 359).</p>
<p id="e0fc18c2-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><span title="175" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-175">p. 175</span><b>Delivery</b></p>
<p id="e0fc18c3-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In order to have a valid inter vivos gift, there must be a delivery of the gift, either by a physical delivery of the subject of the gift or a constructive or symbolic delivery such as by an instrument of gift, sufficient to divest the donor of dominion and control over the property. As the statement of the rule suggests, the requirement of delivery is not rigid or inflexible, but is to be applied in light of its purpose to avoid mistakes by donors and fraudulent claims by donees. Accordingly, what is sufficient to constitute delivery “must be tailored to suit the circumstances of the case” (Matter of Szabo, supra, 10 N.Y.2d at p.98, 217 N.Y.S.2d 593, 176 N.E.2d 395). The rule requires that “‘[t]he delivery necessary to consummate a gift must be as perfect as the nature of the property and the circumstances and surroundings of the parties will reasonably permit”’ (id.).</p>
<p id="e0fc3fd4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant contends that when a tangible piece of personal property such as a painting is the subject of a gift, physical delivery of the painting itself is the best form of delivery and should be required. Here, of course, we have only delivery of Victor Gruen’s letters which serve as instruments of gift. Defendant’s statement of the rule as applied may be generally true, but it ignores the fact that what Victor Gruen gave plaintiff was not all rights to the Klimt painting, but only title to it with no right of possession until his death. Under these circumstances, it would be illogical for the law to require the donor to part with possession of the painting when that is exactly what he intends to retain.</p>
<p id="e0fc3fd5-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor is there any reason to require a donor making a gift of a remainder interest in a chattel to physically deliver the chattel into the donee’s hands only to have the donee redeliver it to the donor. As the facts of this case demonstrate, such a requirement could impose practical burdens on the parties to the gift while serving the delivery requirement poorly. Thus, in order to accomplish this type of delivery the parties would have been required to travel to New York for the symbolic transfer and redelivery of the Klimt painting which was hanging on the wall of Victor Gruen’s Manhattan apartment. Defendant suggests that such a requirement would be stronger evidence of a completed gift, but in the absence of witnesses to the event or any written confirmation of the gift it would provide less protection against fraudulent claims than have the written instruments of gift delivered in this case.</p>
<p id="e0fc3fd6-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>Acceptance</b></p>
<p id="e0fc3fd7-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Acceptance by the donee is essential to the validity of an inter vivos gift, but when a gift is of value to the donee, as it is here, the law will presume an acceptance on his part. Plaintiff did not rely on this presumption alone but also presented clear and convincing proof of his acceptance of a remainder interest in the Klimt painting by evidence that he had made several contemporaneous statements acknowledging the gift to his friends and associates, even showing some of them his father’s gift letter, and that he had retained both letters for over 17 years to verify the gift after his father died. Defendant relied exclusively on affidavits filed by plaintiff in a matrimonial action with his former wife, in which plaintiff failed to list his interest in the painting as an asset. These affidavits were made over 10 years after acceptance was complete and they do not even approach the evidence in Matter of Kelly (285 N.Y. 139, 148-149, 33 N.E.2d 62 [dissenting in part opn.], supra) where the donee, immediately upon delivery of a diamond ring, rejected it as “too flashy.” We agree with the Appellate Division that interpretation of the affidavit was too speculative to support a finding of rejection and overcome the substantial showing of acceptance by plaintiff.</p>
<p id="e0fc3fd8-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, the judgment appealed from and the order of the Appellate Division brought up for review should be affirmed, with costs.</p>

The group cut the statue, which was made of lead, into pieces and transported it to Connecticut to be melted down and cast into bullets. While the patriots paused to imbibe, some Loyalists managed to steal the pieces of the statue and carry them away. The Loyalists scattered the pieces in the Davis Swamp in Connecticut, and fragments of the statue have turned up from time to time ever since then.</p>
<p id="e0fc66f6-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1995, James Abel learned that part of the statue might be located on Shondra Brown’s property, specifically, the Davis Swamp. Although he knew that the Swamp was private property, he entered the area and, using a metal detector, located a large fragment of the statue, which was embedded nearly a foot below the soil. Abel dug up the fragment and removed it from Brown’s property. Brown did not learn about these events until much later when a newspaper article appeared describing what had occurred. In the meantime, Abel sold the piece to the Museum of the City of New York for $10,000. The museum continues to hold the piece pending resolution of the dispute.</p>

Arroz’s deed correctly described the half acre of land now in dispute. On April 1, 2012, Brianna Bourne purchased a 100-acre parcel of land which adjoined and bordered Arroz’s land along the entire common boundary. That common boundary was open, with no fence or other structure separating the two parcels. Brianna bought the land from her parents, the Bournes, who had purchased the land in 2005. Neither the deed to Brianna from the Bournes nor the deed to the Bournes from their predecessors described the half acre of land in dispute. </p>

<div id="e1280b0c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" level="A" class="epub-section epub-ahead cc-section"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-xlarge left"><h2><p class="cc-wrapper" id="e1280b0d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f">A.&nbsp;INTRODUCTION TO BUYING AND SELLING REAL ESTATE</p></h2></div>


<p id="e1280b0e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While most real estate transactions share many elements in common, each deal presents its own complications and challenges. The following example illustrates the steps that will take place as Robert and Elizabeth Byar (which is to say, of course, Bob and Betty Byar) go about buying a home. The first step for the Byars is to assess how much they can afford to pay, given their income and savings (lenders frequently require borrowers to contribute 10 to 20 percent of the purchase price as a down payment). The Byars might also contact a mortgage bank or financial institution to pre-qualify for a loan. Then the search for properties will begin, perhaps with the Byars using an Internet site such as www.realtor.com to learn about the market. But eventually, if they are like most home buyers, the Byars will consult a broker with access to Multiple Listing Service (MLS) listings and happy to show a variety of homes. The commission for the broker will typically be paid for by the seller.</p>
<p id="e1280b0f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once the Byars find a house they want to buy, they’ll begin negotiating a purchase and sale agreement. Usually it’s best to hire an attorney to do this, but in some states brokers are permitted to provide the service. In any event, the agreement will probably be done in terms of a form contract such as the one on pages 348–361, which we will be referring to from time to time. The contract will set forth the legal description of the property, its price, provision for an earnest money deposit, and the date for the closing or settlement (the transfer of title).</p>
<p id="e1280b10-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Real estate contracts are almost always executory, meaning that title is not transferred immediately upon signing the agreement, because both buyers and seller must do certain things during the time between the contract and closing. The buyer will need to obtain a title search to satisfy herself and her lender that the seller can convey good title to the property. The title search is conducted by a title company in some states, by attorneys in others. Most contracts of sale also contain a mortgage contingency, which provides that if the purchaser cannot obtain a mortgage loan within a given time, she can rescind the contract and get back her deposit. For an example of a mortgage contingency clause, see paragraph <span title="348" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-348">p. 348</span>11 in the form contract. A second contingency found in many contracts is a clause allowing the buyer to obtain an inspection of the property and rescind the contract if the cost of remedying the problem exceeds some threshold. See paragraph 10 of the form contract. Sometimes this clause is the most heatedly negotiated part of the sales contract.</p>
<p id="e1280b11-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After the contract has been signed by both parties, either the Byars or the seller will order a title search. The Byars will also typically apply for a mortgage loan and have an inspector visit the property. The title company or lawyer who does the search will provide an abstract of title that will list any encumbrances (such as existing mortgages, liens, rights of way), as well as a listing of the preceding owners of the property. Assuming that the title abstract turns up nothing troubling, the transaction moves forward. If the Byars’ application for a mortgage is approved by the lender, they are issued a mortgage commitment that is good for a specified period—typically a couple of months. If all of the other contingencies are satisfied, the Byars and their seller proceed to the closing and transfer of title.</p>
<p id="e1280b12-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In many states (New York, for example), the transfer of the deed takes place with all parties physically present; in some other states (California, for example), transfer is handled by a third-party escrow agent. The lender provides the proceeds of the loan to the seller, who uses that money and the additional funds paid by the Byars to (1) pay off any existing loans on the property, (2) pay the real estate brokers their commission, (3) pay the legal fees and other fees (such as title insurance) he has agreed to take care of, and (4) pocket the remaining proceeds. At the same time the lender advances the funds for the purchase, the seller transfers title to the property to the Byars by giving them a deed; they sign a promissory note for the loan; they execute a mortgage or deed of trust in favor of the lender and pay fees for the services provided by their lawyer, the title company, and any other parties involved in the transaction. In most instances, a title insurance company will record the deed and mortgage at the County Clerk’s office. The company also will issue a policy of title insurance, which promises to defend against any adverse claims and pay a fixed amount if the title is later found to be flawed or unmarketable. The Byars are now the proud owners of a new home.</p>

<p id="e129b85b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The original English Statute of Frauds of 1677, sought to make people more secure in their property and their contracts by making deceitful claims unenforceable. The statute required that contracts for the sale and purchase of real property must be in writing in order to be legally enforceable. Every American state has adopted some version of the Statute of Frauds, either by statute or by judicial decision.</p>
<p id="e129b85c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are minimally three requirements for satisfying the Statute of Frauds: a memorandum of sale must be <i>signed</i> by the party to be bound, <i>describe</i> the real estate, and state the <i>price</i>. Courts have been somewhat flexible about what terms must be stated in the writing. For example, when a price has been agreed upon, most courts regard it as an essential term that must be set forth. But if no price was agreed upon, a court may imply an agreement to pay a reasonable price.</p>

<p id="e129b85f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are three basic requirements under the Statute of Frauds:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="e129b860-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">signature — the agreement must be signed by the party sought to be charged</p></li>

<p id="e129b863-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Exceptions to the Statute of Frauds.</i> Courts have created two principal exceptions to the Statute of Frauds: <i>part performance</i> and <i>estoppel</i>. Part performance allows the specific enforcement of oral agreements when particular acts have been performed by one of the parties to the agreement. Acts held to constitute part performance vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, depending primarily on how the court views the theoretical basis for the doctrine of part performance. One theory is that the acts of the parties substantially satisfy the evidentiary requirements of the Statute. Hence if the acts make sense only as having been performed pursuant to the oral contract, they constitute part performance. Such acts include the buyer’s taking possession <i>and</i> paying all or part of the purchase price or making valuable improvements. Another theory of part performance is that it is a doctrine used to prevent injurious reliance on the contract; if the plaintiff shows that he would suffer irreparable injury if the contract were not enforced, then the buyer’s taking of possession alone is sufficient to set the court in motion.</p>

A Superior Court judge has adopted the agreed facts as “findings.” We are in the same position as was the trial judge (who received no evidence and saw and heard no witnesses).</p>
<p id="e129b86b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mrs. Gladys Green owns a lot (Lot S) in the Manomet section of Plymouth. In July, 1980, she advertised it for sale. On July 11 and 12, Hickey and his wife discussed with Mrs. Green purchasing Lot S and “orally agreed to a sale” for $15,000. Mrs. Green on July 12 accepted a deposit check of $500, marked by Hickey on the back, “Deposit on Lot . . . Massasoit Ave. Manomet . . . Subject to Variance from Town of Plymouth.” Mrs. Green’s brother and agent “was under the impression that a zoning variance was needed and [had] advised . . . Hickey to write” the quoted language on the deposit check. It turned out, however, by July 16 that no variance would be required. Hickey had left the payee line of the deposit check blank, because of uncertainty whether Mrs. Green or her brother was to receive the check, and asked “Mrs. Green to fill in the appropriate name.” Mrs. Green held the check, did not fill in the payee’s name, and neither cashed nor endorsed it. Hickey “stated to Mrs. Green that his intention was to sell his home and build on Mrs. Green’s lot.”</p>

Hickey told Mrs. Green that he had already sold his house and offered her $16,000 for Lot S. Mrs. Green refused this offer.</p>
<p id="e129df7e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Hickeys filed this complaint seeking specific performance.

<p id="e129df84-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The earlier Massachusetts decisions laid down somewhat strict requirements for an estoppel precluding the assertion of the Statute of Frauds. See, e.g., Glass v. Hulbert, 102 Mass. 24, 31-32, 43-44 (1869); Davis v. Downer, 210 Mass. 573, 576-577, 97 N.E. 90 (1912); Hazelton v. Lewis, 267 Mass. 533, 538-540, 166 N.E. 876 (1929); Andrews v. Charon, 289 Mass. 1, 5-7, 193 N.E. 737 (1935), where specific performance was granted upon a consideration of “the effect of all the facts in combination;” Winstanley v. Chapman, 325 Mass. 130, 133, 89 N.E.2d 506 (1949); Park, Real Estate Law, §883 (1981). . . . Frequently there has been an actual change of possession and improvement of the transferred property, as well as full payment of the full purchase price, or one or more of these elements. . . .</p>
<p id="e129df85-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The present facts reveal a simple case of a proposed purchase of a residential vacant lot, where the vendor, Mrs. Green, knew that the Hickeys were planning to sell their former home (possibly to obtain funds to pay her) and build on Lot S. The Hickeys, relying on Mrs. Green’s oral promise, moved rapidly to make their sale without obtaining any adequate memorandum of the terms of what appears to have been intended to be a quick cash sale of Lot S. So rapid was action by the Hickeys that, by July 21, less than ten days after giving their deposit to Mrs. Green, they had accepted a deposit check for the sale of their house, endorsed the check, and placed it in their bank account. Above their signatures endorsing the check was a memorandum probably sufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds under A.B.C. Auto Parts, Inc. v. Moran, 359 Mass. 327, 329-331, 268 N.E.2d 844 (1971). Cf. Guarino v. Zyfers, 9 Mass. App. 874, 401 N.E.2d 857 (1980). At the very least, the Hickeys had bound themselves in a manner in which, to avoid a transfer of their own house, they might have had to engage in expensive litigation. No attorney has been shown to have been used either in the transaction between Mrs. Green and the Hickeys or in that between the Hickeys and their purchaser.</p>
<span title="365" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-365">p. 365</span>
<p id="e129df86-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no denial by Mrs. Green of the oral contract between her and the Hickeys. This, under §129 of the Restatement, is of some significance.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN104EB_5eaa39f2-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N104EB_5eaa39f2-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">4</a></span> There can be no doubt (a) that Mrs. Green made the promise on which the Hickeys so promptly relied, and also (b) she, nearly as promptly, but not promptly enough, repudiated it because she had a better opportunity. The stipulated facts require the conclusion that in equity Mrs. Green’s conduct cannot be condoned. This is not a case where either party is shown to have contemplated the negotiation of a purchase and sale agreement. If a written agreement had been expected, even by only one party, or would have been natural (because of the participation by lawyers or otherwise), a different situation might have existed. It is a permissible inference from the agreed facts that the rapid sale of the Hickeys’ house was both appropriate and expected. These are not circumstances where negotiations fairly can be seen as inchoate. . . .</p>
<p id="e129df88-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Over two years have passed since July, 1980, and over a year since the trial judge’s findings were filed on July 6, 1981. At that time, the principal agreed facts of record bearing upon the extent of the injury to the Hickeys (because of their reliance on Mrs. Green’s promise to convey Lot S) were those based on the Hickeys’ new obligation to convey their house to a purchaser. Performance of that agreement had been extended to May 1, 1981. If that agreement has been abrogated or modified since the trial, the case may take on a different posture. If enforcement of that agreement still will be sought, or if that agreement has been carried out, the conveyance of Lot S by Mrs. Green should be required now.</p>
<p id="e12a0699-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case, in any event, must be remanded to the trial judge for the purpose of amending the judgment to require conveyance of Lot S by Mrs. Green only upon payment to her in cash within a stated period of the balance of the agreed price of $15,000. The trial judge, however, in her discretion and upon proper offers of proof of counsel, may reopen the record to receive, in addition to the presently stipulated facts, a stipulation or evidence concerning the present status of the Hickeys’ apparent obligation to sell their house. If the circumstances have changed, it will be open to the trial judge to require of Mrs. Green, instead of specific performance, only full restitution to the Hickeys of all costs reasonably caused to them in respect of these transactions (including advertising costs, deposits, and their reasonable costs for this litigation) with interest. The case is remanded to the Superior Court Department for further action consistent with this opinion. The Hickeys are to have costs of this appeal.</p>

<p id="e12a2dbc-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dr. Lohmeyer gave the abstract of title to a lawyer to examine, and from the lawyer Dr. Lohmeyer learned that the city of Emporia had a zoning ordinance providing that no frame building could be erected within three feet of a side or rear lot line. The frame house on lot 37 was located within 18 inches of the north line of the lot in violation of the ordinance. The Bowers had, in 1946, moved the house, which had been built elsewhere, onto lot 37.

From what has been heretofore related, since resort to the contract makes it clear appellees agreed to convey the involved property with an abstract of title showing good merchantable title, free and clear of all encumbrances, it becomes apparent the all decisive issue presented by the pleadings and the stipulation is whether such property is subject to encumbrances or other burdens making the title unmerchantable and if so whether they are such as are excepted by the provision of the contract which reads “subject however, to all restrictions and easements of record applying to this property.”</p>
<p id="e12a2dbf-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Decision of the foregoing issue can be simplified by directing attention early to the appellant’s position.

This, we may add, limited to restrictions imposed by terms of the ordinance relating to the use of land or the location and character of buildings that may be located thereon, even in the absence of provisions in the contract excepting them, must necessarily be his position for we are convinced, although it must be conceded there are some decisions to the contrary, the rule supported by the better reasoned decisions, indeed if not by the great weight of authority, is that municipal restrictions of such character, existing at the time of the execution of a contract for the sale of real estate, are not such encumbrances or burdens on title as may be availed of by a vendee to avoid his agreement to purchase on the ground they render his title unmerchantable.

This court has been called on to pass upon that question on numerous occasions. See our recent decision in Peatling v. Baird, 168 Kan. 528, 213 P.2d 1015, and cases there cited, wherein we held:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="e12a54d5-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A marketable title to real estate is one which is free from reasonable doubt, and a title is doubtful and unmarketable if it exposes the party holding it to the hazard of litigation.</p>
<p id="e12a54d6-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To render the title to real estate unmarketable, the defect of which the purchaser complains must be of a substantial character and one from which he may suffer injury. Mere immaterial defects which do not diminish in quantity, quality or value the property contracted for, constitute no ground upon which the purchaser may reject the title. Facts must be known at the time which fairly raise a reasonable doubt as to the title; a mere possibility or conjecture that such a state of facts may be developed at some future time is not sufficient.</p>

It follows, since, as we have indicated, the appellees had contracted to convey such real estate to appellant by warranty deed with an abstract of title showing good merchantable title, free and clear of all encumbrances, that they cannot convey the title contracted for and that the trial court should have rendered judgment rescinding the contract.

Assuming, without deciding, they might remedy the violation of the ordinance by buying additional ground the short and simple answer to their contention with respect to the violation of the restrictions imposed by the dedication declaration is that any changes in the house would compel the purchaser to take something that he did not contract to buy.</p>

Would you have advised Dr. Lohmeyer not to sign it? First, the contract provides that Lohmeyer agrees to take the property subject to all restrictions and easements on record. Second, it provides that the sellers must provide Lohmeyer “with an abstract of title, certified to date showing good merchantable title <i>or</i> an Owners Policy of Title Insurance.” Suppose that a title insurance company, of which you will learn more in Chapter 8, agreed to issue a policy of title insurance on the property, guaranteeing title, even though the title is legally unmarketable. Would Lohmeyer be entitled to rescind the contract? See Creative Living, Inc. v. Steinhauser, 355 N.Y.S.2d 897 (App. Div. 1974), aff’d without opinion, 365 N.Y.S.2d 987 (App. Div. 1975) (contract provided seller shall have a title such as a title insurer would insure; “[t]his provision in the contract made the title company the final judge of title and when the title company was prepared to insure title in accordance with the contract no further requirement had to be met”).</p>

Why do courts not rule that the seller must produce a complete chain of title from an unimpeachable source (a sovereign) and prove that no encumbrance exists? See William B. Stoebuck &amp; Dale A. Whitman, The Law of Property §10.12 (3d ed. 2000).</p>
<p id="e12a7bef-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why do public restrictions on land use, such as zoning or wetlands designations, make title unmarketable only if they are violated (see Truck South, Inc. v. Patel, 528 S.E.2d 424 (S.C. 2000) (wetlands); War Eagle, Inc. v. Belair, 694 S.E.2d 497 (N.C. App. 2010) (zoning); Wolf v. Commonwealth Land Title Ins. Co., 690 N.Y.S.2d 880 (App. Div. 1999) (zoning)), whereas private covenants make title unmarketable whether or not they are violated?

Astro-Pac, Inc., 363 N.E.2d 347 (N.Y. 1977) (easement is an encumbrance, even though it does not diminish value of property); Ziskind v. Bruce Lee Corp., 307 A.2d 377 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1973) (knowledge of easement irrelevant; title unmarketable); Ludke v. Egan, 274 N.W.2d 641 (Wis. 1979) (easement known to purchaser, or open and obvious, does not make title unmarketable).</p>

<p id="e12a7bf2-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Equitable conversion.</i></b> Both purchasers and sellers of real property are normally entitled to specific performance as a remedy for the other’s breach of contract (see page 387). The doctrine of equitable conversion, simply put, is that if there is a specifically enforceable contract for the sale of land, equity regards as done that which ought to be done. The buyer is viewed in equity as the owner from the date of the contract (thus having the “equitable title”); the seller has a claim for money secured by a vendor’s lien on the land. The seller is also said to hold the legal title as trustee for the buyer.</p>
<p id="e12a7bf3-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Risk of loss.</i> Equitable conversion has been used by some courts to determine whether the seller or the purchaser takes the loss when the premises are destroyed between signing the contract of sale and the closing, and the contract has no provision allocating the risk of loss. Paine v. Meller, 31 Eng. Rep. 1088 (Ch. 1801), held that from the time of the contract of sale of real estate the burden of fortuitous loss is on the purchaser, even though the seller retains possession. This result was said to follow from equitable conversion, treating the purchaser as owner. Most courts are thought to follow this view. Some courts, however, have declined to apply equitable conversion and have held that the loss is on the seller until legal title is conveyed. In Massachusetts, the risk of loss is on the seller if the loss is substantial and the terms of the contract show that the building constituted an important part of the subject matter of the contract; if the loss is not substantial, either party can enforce the contract, though an abatement in purchase price may be given. In some other states, the risk of loss is placed on the party in possession, the view also taken by the Uniform Vendor and Purchaser Act (1935). See, e.g., Brush Grocery Kart, Inc. v. Sure Fine Market, Inc., 47 P.3d 680 (Colo. 2002). If the purchaser has the risk of loss, and the seller has insurance, in most states the seller holds the insurance proceeds as trustee for the buyer. See Bryant v. Willison Real Estate Co., 350 S.E.2d 748 (W. Va. 1986) (discussing the law of many states).</p>
<p id="e12a7bf4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Inheritance.</i> Equitable conversion has been applied in situations when one of the parties to a contract for the sale of land dies and the issue arises whether the decedent’s interest is real property or personal property. If equitable conversion has occurred, the seller’s interest is personal property (right to the purchase price), and the buyer is treated as owner of the land.</p>

<p id="e12aa30c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">R<span class="epub-small-caps">ubin</span>, J. Plaintiff, to his horror, discovered that the house he had recently contracted to purchase was widely reputed to be possessed by poltergeists, reportedly seen by defendant seller and members of her family on numerous occasions over the last nine years. Plaintiff promptly commenced this action seeking rescission of the contract of sale. Supreme Court reluctantly dismissed the complaint, holding that plaintiff has no remedy at law in this jurisdiction.</p>
<p id="e12aa30d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The unusual facts of this case, as disclosed by the record, clearly warrant a grant of equitable relief to the buyer who, as a resident of New York City, cannot be expected to have any familiarity with the folklore of the Village of Nyack. Not being a “local,” plaintiff could not readily learn that the home he had contracted to purchase is haunted. Whether the source of the spectral apparitions seen by defendant seller are parapsychic or psychogenic, having reported their presence in both a national publication (Reader’s Digest) and the local press (in 1977 and 1982, respectively), defendant is estopped to deny their existence and, as a matter of law, the house is haunted. More to the point, however, no divination is required to conclude that it is defendant’s promotional efforts in publicizing her close encounters with these spirits which fostered the home’s reputation in the community. In 1989, the house was included in a five-home walking tour of Nyack and described in a November 27th newspaper article as “a riverfront Victorian (with ghost).” The impact of the reputation thus created goes to the very essence of the bargain between the parties, greatly impairing both the value of the property and its potential for resale. The extent of this impairment may be presumed for the purpose of reviewing the disposition of this motion to dismiss the cause of action for rescission (Harris v. City of New York, 147 A.D.2d 186, 188-189) and represents merely an issue of fact for resolution at trial.</p>
<p id="e12aa30e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While I agree with Supreme Court that the real estate broker, as agent for the seller, is under no duty to disclose to a potential buyer the phantasmal reputation of the premises and that, in his pursuit of a legal remedy for fraudulent misrepresentation against the seller, plaintiff hasn’t a ghost of a chance, I am nevertheless moved by the spirit of equity to allow the buyer to seek rescission of the contract of sale and recovery of his down payment. New York law fails to recognize any remedy for damages incurred as a result of the seller’s mere silence, applying instead the strict rule of caveat emptor. Therefore, the theoretical basis for granting relief, even under the extraordinary facts of this case, is elusive if not ephemeral.</p>
<p id="e12aa30f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Pity me not but lend thy serious hearing to what I shall unfold” (William Shakespeare, Hamlet, Act I, Scene V [Ghost]).</p>
<p id="e12aa310-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From the perspective of a person in the position of plaintiff herein, a very practical problem arises with respect to the discovery of a paranormal phenomenon: “Who <span title="372" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-372">p. 372</span>you gonna’ call?” as a title song to the movie “Ghostbusters” asks. Applying the strict rule of caveat emptor to a contract involving a house possessed by poltergeists conjures up visions of a psychic or medium routinely accompanying the structural engineer and Terminix man on an inspection of every home subject to a contract of sale. It portends that the prudent attorney will establish an escrow account lest the subject of the transaction come back to haunt him and his client—or pray that his malpractice insurance coverage extends to supernatural disasters. In the interest of avoiding such untenable consequences, the notion that a haunting is a condition which can and should be ascertained upon reasonable inspection of the premises is a hobgoblin which should be exorcised from the body of legal precedent and laid quietly to rest.</p>
<p id="e12aa311-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It has been suggested by a leading authority that the ancient rule which holds that mere nondisclosure does not constitute actionable misrepresentation “finds proper application in cases where the fact undisclosed is patent, or the plaintiff has equal opportunities for obtaining information which he may be expected to utilize, or the defendant has no reason to think that he is acting under any misapprehension” (Prosser, Torts §106, at 696 (4th ed. 1971)). However, with respect to transactions in real estate, New York adheres to the doctrine of caveat emptor and imposes no duty upon the vendor to disclose any information concerning the premises (London v. Courduff, 141 A.D.2d 803) unless there is a confidential or fiduciary relationship between the parties (Moser v. Spizzirro, 31 A.D.2d 537, aff’d 25 N.Y.2d 941; IBM Credit Fin. Corp. v. Mazda Motor Mfg. [USA] Corp., 152 A.D.2d 451) or some conduct on the part of the seller which constitutes “active concealment” (see, 17 E. 80th Realty Corp. v. 68th Assocs., 173 A.D.2d 245 (dummy ventilation system constructed by seller); Haberman v. Greenspan, 82 Misc. 2d 263 (foundation cracks covered by seller)). Normally, some affirmative misrepresentation (e.g., Tahini Invs. v. Bobrowsky, 99 A.D.2d 489 (industrial waste on land allegedly used only as farm); Jansen v. Kelly, 11 A.D.2d 587 (land containing valuable minerals allegedly acquired for use as campsite)) or partial disclosure (Junius Constr. Corp. v. Cohen, 257 N.Y. 393 (existence of third unopened street concealed); Noved Realty Corp. v. A.A.P. Co., 250 A.D. 1 (escrow agreements securing lien concealed)) is required to impose upon the seller a duty to communicate undisclosed conditions affecting the premises (contra, Young v. Keith, 112 A.D.2d 625 (defective water and sewer systems concealed)).</p>
<p id="e12aa312-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Caveat emptor is not so all-encompassing a doctrine of common law as to render every act of nondisclosure immune from redress, whether legal or equitable. . . . Where fairness and common sense dictate that an exception should be created, the evolution of the law should not be stifled by rigid application of a legal maxim.</p>
<p id="e12aa313-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The doctrine of caveat emptor requires that a buyer act prudently to assess the fitness and value of his purchase and operates to bar the purchaser who fails to exercise due care from seeking the equitable remedy of rescission (see, e.g., Rodas v. Manitaras, 159 A.D.2d 341). . . . It should be apparent, however, that the most meticulous inspection and search would not reveal the presence of poltergeists at the premises or unearth the property’s ghoulish reputation in the community. Therefore, there is no sound policy reason to deny plaintiff relief for failing to discover a state of affairs which the most prudent purchaser would not be expected to even contemplate (see, Da Silva v. Musso, 53 N.Y.2d 543, 551).</p>
<span title="373" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-373">p. 373</span>
<p id="e12aa314-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case law in this jurisdiction dealing with the duty of a vendor of real property to disclose information to the buyer is distinguishable from the matter under review. The most salient distinction is that existing cases invariably deal with the physical condition of the premises (e.g., London v. Courduff, supra) (use as a landfill); Perin v. Mardine Realty Co., 5 A.D.2d 685, affd 6 N.Y.2d 920 (sewer line crossing adjoining property without owner’s consent), defects in title (e.g., Sands v. Kissane, 282 A.D. 140 (remainderman)), liens against the property (e.g., Noved Realty Corp. v. A.A.P. Co., supra), expenses or income (e.g., Rodas v. Manitaras, supra (gross receipts)) and other factors affecting its operation. No case has been brought to this court’s attention in which the property value was impaired as the result of the reputation created by information disseminated to the public by the seller (or, for that matter, as a result of possession by poltergeists).</p>
<p id="e12aa315-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where a condition which has been created by the seller materially impairs the value of the contract and is peculiarly within the knowledge of the seller or unlikely to be discovered by a prudent purchaser exercising due care with respect to the subject transaction, nondisclosure constitutes a basis for rescission as a matter of equity. Any other outcome places upon the buyer not merely the obligation to exercise care in his purchase but rather to be omniscient with respect to any fact which may affect the bargain. No practical purpose is served by imposing such a burden upon a purchaser. To the contrary, it encourages predatory business practice and offends the principle that equity will suffer no wrong to be without a remedy.</p>
<p id="e12aa316-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant’s contention that the contract of sale, particularly the merger or “as is” clause, bars recovery of the buyer’s deposit is unavailing. Even an express disclaimer will not be given effect where the facts are peculiarly within the knowledge of the party invoking it (Danaan Realty Corp. v. Harris, 5 N.Y.2d 317, 322; Tahini Invs. v. Bobrowsky, supra). Moreover, a fair reading of the merger clause reveals that it expressly disclaims only representations made with respect to the physical condition of the premises and merely makes general reference to representations concerning “any other matter or things affecting or relating to the aforesaid premises.” As broad as this language may be, a reasonable interpretation is that its effect is limited to tangible or physical matters and does not extend to paranormal phenomena. Finally, if the language of the contract is to be construed as broadly as defendant urges to encompass the presence of poltergeists in the house, it cannot be said that she has delivered the premises “vacant” in accordance with her obligation under the provisions of the contract rider. . . .</p>
<p id="e12aa317-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the case at bar, defendant seller deliberately fostered the public belief that her home was possessed. Having undertaken to inform the public-at-large, to whom she has no legal relationship, about the supernatural occurrences on her property, she may be said to owe no less a duty to her contract vendee. It has been remarked that the occasional modern cases which permit a seller to take unfair advantage of a buyer’s ignorance so long as he is not actively misled are “singularly unappetizing” (Prosser, Torts §106, at 696 (4th ed. 1971)). Where, as here, the seller not only takes unfair advantage of the buyer’s ignorance but has created and perpetuated a condition about which he is unlikely to even inquire, enforcement of the contract (in whole or in part) is offensive to the court’s sense of equity. Application of the remedy of rescission, within the bounds of the narrow exception to the doctrine of caveat emptor set forth herein, is entirely appropriate to relieve the unwitting purchaser from the consequences of a most unnatural bargain.</p>

<p id="e12aca34-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In determining whether a seller of a home has a duty to disclose latent material defects to a buyer, the established tort law distinction between misfeasance and nonfeasance, action and inaction must carefully be analyzed. The highly individualistic philosophy of the earlier common law consistently imposed liability upon the commission of affirmative acts of harm, but shrank from converting the courts into an institution for forcing men to help one another. This distinction is deeply rooted in our case law. Liability for nonfeasance has therefore been slow to receive recognition in the evolution of tort law.</p>
<p id="e12aca35-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In theory, the difference between misfeasance and nonfeasance, action and inaction is quite simple and obvious; however, in practice it is not always easy to draw the line and determine whether conduct is active or passive. That is, where failure to disclose a material fact is calculated to induce a false belief, the distinction between concealment and affirmative representations is tenuous. Both proceed from the same motives and are attended with the same consequences; both are violative of the principles of fair dealing and good faith; both are calculated to produce the same result; and, in fact, both essentially have the same effect.</p>
<p id="e12aca36-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Still there exists in much of our case law the old tort notion that there can be no liability for nonfeasance. The courts in some jurisdictions, including Florida, hold that where the parties are dealing at arm’s length and the facts lie equally open to both parties, with equal opportunity of examination, mere nondisclosure does not constitute a fraudulent concealment. . . .</p>
<p id="e12aca37-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These unappetizing cases are not in tune with the times and do not conform with current notions of justice, equity and fair dealing. One should not be able to stand behind the impervious shield of caveat emptor and take advantage of another’s ignorance. . . . Thus, the tendency of the more recent cases has been to restrict rather than extend the doctrine of caveat emptor. The law appears to be working toward the ultimate conclusion that full disclosure of all material facts must be made whenever elementary fair conduct demands it.</p>
<p id="e12aca38-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The harness placed on the doctrine of caveat emptor in a number of other jurisdictions has resulted in the seller of a home being liable for failing to disclose material defects of which he is aware. This philosophy was succinctly expressed in Lingsch v. Savage, 213 Cal. App. 2d 729, 29 Cal. Rptr. 201 (1963):</p>

<p id="e12aca3a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Posner v. Davis, 76 Ill. App. 3d 638, 32 Ill. Dec. 186, 395 N.E.2d 133 (1979), buyers brought an action alleging that the sellers of a home fraudulently concealed certain defects in the home which included a leaking roof and basement flooding. Relying on <i>Lingsch</i>, the court concluded that the sellers knew of and failed to disclose latent material defects and thus were liable for fraudulent concealment. Id. 32 Ill. Dec. at 190, 395 N.E.2d at 137. Numerous other jurisdictions have followed this view in formulating law involving the sale of homes. See Flakus v. Schug, 213 Neb. 491, 329 N.W.2d 859 (1983) (basement flooding); Thacker v. Tyree, 297 S.E.2d 885 (W. Va. 1982) (cracked walls and foundation problems); Maguire v. Masino, 325 So. 2d 844 (La. Ct. App. 1975) (termite infestation); Weintraub v. Krobatsch, 64 N.J. 445, 317 A.2d 68 (1974) (roach infestation); Cohen v. Vivian, 141 Colo. 443, 349 P.2d 366 (1960) (soil defect).</p>
<p id="e12af14b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are of the opinion, in view of the reasoning and results in <i>Lingsch</i>, <i>Posner</i> and the aforementioned cases decided in other jurisdictions, that the same philosophy regarding the sale of homes should also be the law in the state of Florida. Accordingly, we hold that where the seller of a home knows of facts materially affecting the value of the property which are not readily observable and are not known to the buyer, the seller is under a duty to disclose them to the buyer. This duty is equally applicable to all forms of real property, new and used.</p>
<p id="e12af14c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . Thus, we . . . find that the Johnsons’ fraudulent concealment . . . entitles the Davises to the return of the . . . deposit payment plus interest. We further find that the Davises should be awarded costs and fees. It is so ordered.</p>

<p id="e12af150-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Modern majority view.</i></b> An increasing majority of states puts on the seller the duty to disclose all known defects, equating nondisclosure with fraud or misrepresentation. Caveat emptor is steadily being eroded. When the seller breaches this duty, the buyer can rescind the contract or sue for damages after the closing. What should the seller’s state of mind be for a buyer to maintain a successful action for nondisclosure? Compare Nystrom v. Cabada, 652 So. 2d 1266 (Fla. App. 1995), with Jensen v. Bailey, 76 So. 3d 980, 983 (Fla. App. 2011).</p>
<p id="e12af151-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In most states, statutes have been enacted requiring the seller to deliver to prospective buyers a written statement disclosing facts about the property. The statutes set forth detailed information forms. The forms vary, but the required disclosure may include known significant structural defects, soil problems, under-ground sewage or storage tanks, presence of hazardous materials, alterations or repairs made without necessary permits, violations of building codes or zoning ordinances, and encroachments by neighbors. See, e.g., Cal. Civ. Code §1102.6 (West Supp. 2015); Wis. Stat. Ann. §709.03 (West Supp. 2012). Some statutes apply only to residential sellers and not to sellers of commercial property.</p>
<p id="e12af152-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In each jurisdiction requiring disclosure, the defect must be “material” to be actionable. One of two tests of materiality is applied: (1) an objective test of <span title="377" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-377">p. 377</span>whether a reasonable person would attach importance to it in deciding to buy, or (2) a subjective test of whether the defect “affects the value or desirability of the property to the buyer.”</p>
<p id="e12af153-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because of increasing litigation over the seller’s failure to disclose, many residential sale contracts prepared by brokers contain a provision that any dispute or claim arising from failure to disclose shall be arbitrated and not sued upon. Is this enforceable? Is it a contract of adhesion if contained in standard sale forms routinely signed by buyers with the broker’s guidance? See Johnson v. Siegel, 101 Cal. Rptr. 2d 412 (Cal. App. 2000) (enforceable); State ex rel. Vincent v. Schneider, 194 S.W.3d 853 (Mo. 2006) (enforceable); TMI, Inc. v. Brooks, 225 S.W.3d 783 (Tex. App. 2007) (enforceable). May a purchaser waive his right to disclosure? See Deptula v. Simpson, 164 P.3d 640 (Alaska 2007).</p>
<p id="e12af154-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Stigma statutes.</i></b> Partly in response to cases finding sellers liable for failing to disclose conditions that “stigmatized” properties, several states have enacted statutes shielding sellers from a failure to disclose psychological or prejudicial factors that might affect market value, such as a murder within the house or that a former occupant died of AIDS. These statutes are known as <i>stigma statutes</i>. See, e.g., N.Y. Real Prop. Law §443(a) (2015).</p>
<p id="e12af155-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Broker’s duty to disclose.</i></b> One of the reasons so many states have passed statutes requiring sellers to disclose defects is the political pressure brought to bear on legislators by real estate brokers. In recent years, brokers have been subjected to liability under a number of theories. They have been found liable for fraud for either intentionally or negligently misrepresenting the condition of a property. See Powell v. Wold, 362 S.E.2d 796 (N.C. App. 1987) (intentional misrepresentation); Bloor v. Fritz, 180 P.3d 805 (Wash. App. 2008) (negligent misrepresentation); Tennant v. Lawton, 615 P.2d 1305 (Wash. App. 1980) (negligent misrepresentation).</p>
<p id="e12af156-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Disclosure of hazardous waste disposal.</i></b> In 1980, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C.A. §§9601-9675. CERCLA imposes strict liability for cleanup costs of a hazardous waste site upon any <i>current owner</i> or operator of a site containing hazardous waste, any <i>prior owner</i> or operator of the site at the time it was contaminated, any generator of hazardous waste, and transporters of hazardous substances. 42 U.S.C.A. §9607(a). The principal implementing agency of CERCLA is the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). At the time CERCLA was enacted, Congress appropriated a “superfund” of $1.6 billion to be used to pay for cleanup costs of sites contaminated with hazardous wastes. The EPA is authorized to use this money to clean up contaminated sites. Then it sues the responsible parties to recover its costs. The cleanup costs of hazardous waste sites can run into the millions of dollars, and the liability of owners can be staggering.</p>
<p id="e12af157-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">CERCLA was amended in 2002 to establish a “bona fide prospective purchaser” defense. 42 U.S.C.A. §9601(40). The defense is available provided that the release of hazardous materials took place before the purchaser bought the property, that the purchaser “made all appropriate inquiries into the previous ownership and uses” of the property, and that the purchaser “exercises appropriate care with respect to hazardous substances found at the facility. . . .”</p>
<p id="e12af158-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Purchasers of contaminated property held liable under CERCLA may sue their sellers for contribution. See, e.g., Sherwin-Williams Co. v. Artra Group, Inc., 125 F. <span title="378" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-378">p. 378</span>Supp. 2d 739 (D.

<p id="e12b1869-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Strawn v. Canuso, 657 A.2d 420 (N.J. 1995), the court held that the builder and selling brokers of new homes had the duty to disclose to potential buyers the existence of a landfill nearby that was suspected of containing toxic waste. The court said that professional sellers and brokers have a duty to disclose off-site as well as on-site conditions that are of sufficient materiality to affect the habitability, use, or enjoyment of the property and, therefore, render the property substantially less desirable or valuable to the objectively reasonable buyer. Although this duty appears to call for very broad disclosure, the court limited it somewhat by this comment:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="e12b186a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not hold that sellers and brokers have a duty to investigate or disclose transient social conditions in the community that arguably affect the value of the property. In the absence of a purchaser communicating specific needs, builders and brokers should not be held to decide whether the changing nature of a neighborhood, the presence of a group home, or the existence of a school in decline are facts material to the transaction. Rather we root in the land the duty to disclose off-site conditions that are material to the transaction. [657 A.2d at 431.]</p>

<p id="e12b186b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Within six months of the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Strawn</i>, the New Jersey legislature passed the New Residential Construction Off-Site Conditions Disclosure Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. §§46:3C-1 to 46:3C-12 (West 2003). The act effectively immunizes sellers of new homes from liability for nondisclosure of off-site conditions, provided they give buyers notice that lists of these conditions are available in the municipal clerk’s office. Despite the immunity, the act permits buyers to maintain lawsuits based upon violations of certain statutes. The immunity provision is interpreted in Nobrega v. Edison Glen Assocs., 743 A.2d 864 (N.J. App. 2000).</p>
<p id="e12b186c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Should the seller and broker have a duty to disclose other known off-site conditions that materially affect the value of the property, such as crimes or drug-dealing in the neighborhood?</p>
<p id="e12b186d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. <i>“As is” clauses.</i></b> Generally, an “as is” clause in a sales contract will be upheld if the defects are reasonably discoverable and there is no fraud. But if there is a fraudulent representation or concealment of information by the seller, the buyer usually is not bound by the “as is” clause. See Prudential Ins. Co. v. Jefferson Assocs., Ltd., 896 S.W.2d 156 (Tex. 1995); Snyder v. Lovercheck, 992 P.2d 1079 (Wyo. 1999) (analyzing cases from many jurisdictions). But cf. Benton v. Clegg Land Co., Ltd., 99 So. 3d 872 (Ala. Civ. App. 2012) (enforcing “as is” clause despite misrepresentation). What if the defects in a property were not disclosed in the mandated disclosure form and were reasonably discoverable? See Burgess v. Fendi, 263 S.W.3d 578 (Ark. App. 2007).</p>
<p id="e12b186e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center ">______________________</p>
<p id="e12b186f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Merger.</i></b> An old doctrine says that when a buyer accepts a deed, the buyer is deemed to be satisfied that all the contractual obligations have been met. Thus the contract merges into the deed, and the deed is deemed the final act of the parties expressing the terms of their agreement. The buyer can no longer sue the seller on <span title="379" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-379">p. 379</span>promises in the contract of sale not contained in the deed, but must sue the seller on the warranties, if any, contained in the deed. There are recognized exceptions to the doctrine, such as fraud and contractual promises deemed collateral to the deed. The merger doctrine principally applies to questions of title or quantity of land. The merger doctrine is now in disfavor and is becoming riddled with exceptions when the buyer does not intend to discharge the seller’s contractual obligations by acceptance of the deed. The usual way of avoiding the doctrine is to say that the particular obligation of the seller is an independent or collateral obligation.</p>
<p id="e12b1870-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>The Implied Warranty of Quality.</i></b> Recall the implied warranty of habitability in landlord-tenant law. (See pages 334–343.) That doctrine has replaced the old common law doctrine of caveat lessee. The same development has occurred with respect to a warranty of quality in land sales contracts. At common law, the rule was caveat emptor. A builder who constructed a home and then sold it to a buyer was protected from liability even if the house was negligently constructed. Today caveat emptor in the sale of real estate by a vendor-builder is, if not yet dead, certainly moribund. A clear majority of jurisdictions now hold, as a matter of law, that an implied warranty of quality or skillful construction exists in contracts for the sale of homes by builders, developers, or other “merchants” of housing. See, e.g., Albrecht v. Clifford, 767 N.E.2d 42 (Mass. 2002). Sales of real estate may also give rise to a similar warranty. Suits on the warranty can arise only after the closing has taken place and the plaintiff has accepted the deed.</p>
<p id="e12b1871-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In most states, the warranty does not impose strict liability. Hence the defendant is liable only if he failed to exercise the standard of skill and care customarily exercised by similar merchants. See, e.g., Lempke v. Dagenais, 547 A.2d 290 (N.H. 1988). Most courts hold that the warranty applies only to significant defects. See, e.g., Petersen v. Hubschman, 389 N.E.2d 1154 (Ill. 1979). Moreover, most courts hold that the warranty covers only latent or hidden defects. See, e.g., Lempke v. Dagenais, supra.</p>

<p id="e12b3e8f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If a purchaser defaults on a contract to purchase realty, as a general rule, the seller has three alternative remedies. The sellers may (1) seek relief in equity for rescission, (2) offer to perform and bring an action for specific performance, or (3) elect to retain the realty and file suit seeking an award of damages. See Van Moorlehem v. Brown Realty Co., 747 F.2d 992, 994 (10th Cir. 1984). Here, Sellers elected to sue for damages. Where a party elects to sue for damages resulting from a breach of land sale contract, the burden is on that party to present competent evidence to support such claim for damages. The rationale underlying the award of damages in a breach of contract case is to compensate the non-defaulting party with just compensation commensurate with his or her loss.</p>

The existence of this list in the contract is evidence upon which the trial court could find that the cost of the warranty was reasonably foreseeable.</p>

<p id="e12b65ac-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After Buyers’ default, Sellers relisted the property for sale and continued making payments on the first and second mortgages on the property until the subsequent sale. Sellers presented evidence that the interest payments on the mortgages totaled $4500. The trial court found that the mortgage interest that Sellers continued to pay on their residence following the breach by Buyers was foreseeable. However, the trial court acknowledged that Sellers enjoyed the benefit of the continued occupancy of the residence and therefore reduced this award of interest by one-half.</p>
<p id="e12b65ad-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court correctly determined that Sellers may be entitled to damages resulting from the payment of mortgage interest due to Buyers’ breach of contract to purchase realty because such damages were reasonably foreseeable. Where a buyer defaults on a residential purchase agreement, thus forcing the seller to replace the property on the market for sale, the lapse of time between the original closing date and a subsequent sale may give rise to the incurring of special damages by the seller. See Shaeffer v. Kelton, 95 N.M. 182, 187, 619 P.2d 1226, 1231 (1980) (after default by purchaser plaintiff may recover interest payments on construction loan for period plaintiff sought to locate another buyer). . . .</p>

<p id="e12b65af-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court awarded punitive damages against Buyers for their conduct in attempting to persuade Sellers to agree to terminate the contract. The trial court found, among other things: Buyers and their family members engaged in acts of extremely poor judgment toward Sellers in their efforts to persuade Sellers to agree to a termination of the contract. One of these acts, Buyers’ and their son’s attempting to contact Mrs. Jones at her house, reasonably frightened Mrs. Jones but did not intimidate Sellers into agreeing to termination of the contract. Buyers made misrepresentations of fact regarding their financial situation in their efforts to persuade [Sellers] to agree to a termination of the contract.</p>
<p id="e12b65b0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the time of their breach of the contract, Buyers had approximately $577,000 in a checking account, and earned income of more than $16,000.00 per month, plus bonuses. <briefstag id="2c9ed79f-fe07-4f23-b006-bb16eaff3325" class="briefElementText" style="background-color: #cbbefc !important;" tabindex="0" data-references="popover" data-toggle="popover" data-original-title="" title="" brieflabelname="Holding" briefnote="" briefparastartoffset="169" briefparaendoffset="545" briefstartoffset="10389" briefendoffset="10765" briefstartparaid="e12b65b0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" briefendparaid="e12b65b0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" enclosingparaidstring="e12b65b0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" onclick="briefTextClicked()">Buyers’ failure to consummate the contract to purchase was wanton, utterly reckless and in utter disregard of their contractual obligations, and was sufficient to warrant the imposition of punitive damages.

<p id="e12b8cc6-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">C<span class="epub-small-caps">lifford</span>, J. . . . On September 1, 1987, defendants, Duncan and Gertrude Pirnie, and plaintiffs, Milton and Ruth Kutzin, signed a contract for the sale of the Kutzins’ house in Haworth for $365,000. The contract, which is the standard-form real-estate sales contract adopted by the New Jersey Association of Realtors, had been prepared by Weichert Realtors (Weichert), the sellers’ real-estate agent. Under its terms, the Pirnies agreed to pay a partial deposit of $1,000 on signing the contract and the remainder of the deposit, $35,000, within seven days. In compliance therewith, the Pirnies made out a check for $1,000 to the trust account of Russo Real Estate (Russo), their real-estate agent. The contract does not contain a “forfeiture” or “liquidated damages” clause; with reference to the disposition of the deposit should the sale not take place, the contract merely states, “If this contract is voided by either party, the escrow monies shall be disbursed pursuant to the written direction of both parties.”</p>
<p id="e12b8cc7-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . The trial court ruled that the parties had entered into a binding contract that had not been rescinded either by agreement or pursuant to the attorney-review clause. Consequently, the court held that the sellers were entitled to $17,325 in damages. That amount consisted of the $12,500 difference between the $365,000 the Pirnies had contracted to pay and the $352,500 for which the house eventually sold; $3,825 in utilities, real-estate taxes, and insurance expenses the Kutzins had incurred during the six-month period between the originally-anticipated closing date and the date of actual sale; and $1,000 the Kutzins had paid for a new basement carpet, which their realtor had recommended they buy to enhance the attractiveness of their house to prospective buyers. The court denied recovery of interest the Kutzins contended they would have earned on the purchase price had the sale to the Pirnies gone through. It also refused to award damages for the increased capital-gains tax the Kutzins had paid as a result of the breach. The court ordered the Kutzins to return the $18,675 balance of the deposit to the Pirnies.</p>
<p id="e12b8cc8-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On appeal, the Kutzins argued that they should recover the lost interest and the increased capital-gains tax they had incurred, or, alternatively, that they should be allowed to retain the deposit. On cross-appeal the Pirnies claimed entitlement to the entire deposit, again asserting that the contract had been validly rescinded. In an unreported opinion, the Appellate Division found that the contract between the parties “was enforceable according to its terms” but that “the Kutzins’ claims to compensation for their allegedly increased tax liability and lost interest were too speculative to be compensable.” The court then noted that “the Kutzins’ loss as determined by the trial court was less than the Pirnies’ $36,000 deposit,” and concluded that “the Kutzins are entitled to retain the [entire] deposit, but they may not recover any additional amount as damages.”</p>
<p id="e12b8cc9-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . The issue of whether a seller should be entitled to retain a deposit when a buyer breaches a contract that does not contain a liquidated-damages or forfeiture clause has long troubled courts. As Professor Williston has observed, “Few questions in the law have given rise to more discussion and difference of opinion than that concerning the right of one who has materially broken his contract without legal excuse to recover for such benefit [here, the deposit] as he may have conferred on the other party. . . .” 12 S. Williston, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts §1473 at 220 (3d ed. 1961) (Williston).</p>

Kelley, 216 Md. 396, 401-02, 140 A.2d 517, 520 (1958).</p>
<p id="e12b8ccb-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">New Jersey traditionally has adhered to the common-law rule. As the Appellate Division stated in Oliver v. Lawson, 92 N.J. Super. 331, 333, 223 A.2d 355 (1966), certif. denied, 48 N.J. 574, 227 A.2d 133 (1967), “It has heretofore generally been held in New Jersey that . . . the defaulting buyer may not recover his deposit, irrespective of the actual damages suffered by the seller and regardless of whether the contract contains a forfeiture provision or not.”</p>
<p id="e12b8ccc-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . [T]he Appellate Division held that the Kutzins are entitled to retain the deposit even though the court was “sympathetic to the trial judge’s ruling that the Pirnies were entitled to the return of the balance of their $36,000 contract deposit in excess of the Kutzins’ actual damages.”</p>
<p id="e12b8ccd-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite the ample authority supporting the Appellate Division’s disposition of the damages question, “there has been a growing recognition of the injustice that often results from the application of the rule permitting total forfeiture of part payments under a contract of sale.” Great United Realty Co. v.

<p id="e12b8cce-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professor Corbin led the movement favoring departure from the strict common-law rule. In The Right of a Defaulting Vendee to the Restitution of Instalments Paid, 40 Yale L.J. 1013, 1013 (1931) (Defaulting Vendee), he stated: “[where there is] proper evidence that the defendant is holding an amount of money as a penalty rather than as compensation for injury, he should be given judgment for restitution of that amount.” Id. at 1025-26 (footnote omitted). He then concluded that</p>

If the facts are such that none of these justifications exists, restitution should be allowed. [Id. at 1032-33.]</p>

Section 374(1) of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts is based on section 357 [of the Restatement] but “is more liberal in allowing recovery in accord with the policy behind Uniform Commercial Code §2-718(2).” Restatement (Second) of Contracts §374 reporter’s note (1981). That section sets forth the rule as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="e12bb3e1-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[I]f a party justifiably refuses to perform on the ground that his remaining duties of performance have been discharged by the other party’s breach, the party in breach is entitled to restitution for any benefit that he has conferred by way of part performance or reliance in excess of the loss that he has caused by his own breach.

</div>
<p id="e12bb3e2-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . Since publication of the first Restatement of Contracts in 1932, few courts have followed the common-law rule refusing restitution. The Restatement approach of allowing recovery “has steadily increased in favor and probably represents the weight <span title="385" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-385">p. 385</span>of authority.” 12 Williston, supra, §1473 at 222. In 1941 the Supreme Court of Rhode Island, in the context of a suit to recover a deposit by a buyer who had breached a real-estate contract, stated the common-law rule but recognized an “exception” allowing recovery for a defaulting vendee in the absence of a liquidated-damages clause “in certain instances where a person has received from another a benefit the retention of which would be unjust under some legal principle or situation which equity has established or recognized.” Seekins v. King, 66 R.I. 105, 110, 17 A.2d 869, 871. By 1953 the Supreme Court of Wisconsin was able to state that its holding was “in accord with the trend of modern decisions which recognize that when the result of retention of moneys paid upon a contract by a vendee who later repudiates his obligation is a clear unjust enrichment of the vendor, the vendor may be required to return such part of the payments as exceeds the loss which the vendee’s default causes him.” Schwartz v. Syver, 264 Wis. 526, 531, 59 N.W.2d 489, 492. And in Wilkins v. Birnbaum, 278 A.2d 829, 831 (1971), the Supreme Court of Delaware recognized that “a defaulting buyer [who] can prove that the deposit exceeds in amount the actual damages resulting from the breach [can] recover back the excess, but the burden of proving this is placed on him.”</p>
<p id="e12bb3e3-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The leading New Jersey case is Oliver v. Lawson, supra, 92 N.J. Super. 331, 223 A.2d 355, in which the court permitted the seller to retain the breaching buyer’s $20,000 deposit on a $215,000 contract even though the seller had sold the property at no significant loss. After recognizing that New Jersey follows the strict common-law rule, the court acknowledged that “[p]laintiffs argue that the more modern view would allow the seller to retain only so much of the deposit as would compensate him for his actual damage sustained. . . .”</p>
<p id="e12bb3e4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court in <i>Oliver</i> then denied recovery to the breaching buyers, stating that “[t]hey failed to present any adequate proof of an unjust enrichment.” Id. at 336, 223 A.2d 355. . . .</p>
<p id="e12bb3e5-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With the issue squarely presented in this case, we overrule those New Jersey cases adhering to the common-law rule and adopt the modern approach set forth in section 374(1) of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts. In Professor Williston’s words, “to deny recovery [in this situation] often gives the [seller] more than fair compensation for the injury he has sustained and imposes a forfeiture (which the law abhors) on the [breaching buyer].” 12 Williston, supra, §1473 at 222. The approach that we adopt is suggested to have the added benefit of promoting economic efficiency: penalties deter “efficient” breaches of contract “by making the cost of the breach to the contract breaker greater than the cost of the breach to the victim.” R. Posner, Economic Analysis of Law §4.10 at 116 (3d ed. 1986).</p>
<p id="e12bb3e6-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that the Pirnies are entitled, under the Restatement formulation of damages, to restitution for any benefit that they conferred by way of part performance or reliance in excess of the loss that they caused by their own breach. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts, supra, §374(1). We stress, however, that “[o]ne who charges an unjust enrichment has the burden of proving it.” Oliver v. Lawson, supra, 92 N.J. Super. at 336, 223 A.2d 355.</p>
<p id="e12bb3e7-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court found that the Kutzins had suffered $17,325 in damages, a figure that we accept because it is not challenged in this Court. The Pirnies’ deposit of $36,000 exceeded the injury caused by their breach by $18,675, and they are thus entitled to recovery of that amount. Our holding is not affected by the fact that the $36,000 deposit was less than ten percent of the $365,000 purchase price. Cf. Krupnick v. Guerriero, 589 A.2d 620, 624 (N.J. Super. 1990) (“As a general rule <span title="386" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-386">p. 386</span>a defaulting buyer may not recover a deposit which does not materially exceed 10%. . . .”). Whenever the breaching buyer proves that the deposit exceeds the seller’s actual damages suffered as a result of the breach, the buyer may recover the difference.</p>
<p id="e12bb3e8-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To ensure that our opinion not be misread, we emphasize that the contract at issue does not contain a forfeiture or liquidated-damages clause; it merely states, “If this contract is voided by either party, the escrow monies shall be disbursed pursuant to the written direction of both parties.” The contract is otherwise silent on the subject of what would happen to the deposit were the sale not to occur. Had the contract contained a liquidated-damages clause, this case would have been governed by section 374(2) of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, which states:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">

</div>
<p id="e12bb3ea-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although we do not consider the validity or enforceability of a liquidated-damages clause in this case, we are reminded of Professor Corbin’s warning: “Penalties and forfeitures are not favored; and calling an outrageous penalty by the more kindly name of liquidated damages does not absolve it from its sin.” Defaulting Vendee, supra, 40 Yale L.J. at 1016; cf. Central Steel Drum Co. v. Gold Cooperage, Inc., 491 A.2d 49 (N.J. Super. 1985) (considering validity of liquidated-damages clause).</p>
<p id="e12bb3eb-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We . . . hold that the Kutzins cannot retain the entire deposit as damages.

<p id="e12bdb01-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Damages and timing.</i></b> As noted in <i>Jones</i>, the general rule for a party seeking damages for breach of a contract to convey real estate is the difference between the contract price and the fair market value at the time of breach. See, e.g., White v. Farrell, 20 N.Y.3d 487 (N.Y. 2013); Kirkpatrick v. Strosberg, 894 N.E.2d 781 (Ill. App. 2008). This rule, however, might only protect the expectations of the parties in a static market. Because of the inequity that can result in calculating damages at the time of a buyer’s breach in a real estate market that is rapidly declining, making it more difficult for the nondefaulting seller to find a new buyer, some courts have allowed damages to be calculated on the date the property is re-sold. Kuhn v. Spatial Design, Inc., 585 A.2d 967, 971 (N.J. App. 1991). In this respect, the court in <i>Kuhn</i> adopted the essence of the Uniform Commercial Code—which applies only to sales of goods—regarding sellers’ damages. See, e.g., Gerald Korngold, Seller’s Damages from a Defaulting Buyer of Realty: The Influence of the Uniform Land Transactions Act on the Courts, 20 Nova L. Rev. 1069 (1996).</p>
<span title="387" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-387">p. 387</span>
<p id="e12bdb02-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The common law rule for buyer’s damages upon breach by seller is also based on the value of a property at the time of breach, minus the contract price. Though it is not commonly done, buyers can also argue that their damages should be calculated at the time of the defaulting vendor’s re-sale of the property, so that the buyer (rather than the defaulting seller) recoups any profit. See Coppola Enters., Inc. v. Alfone, 506 So. 2d 1180 (Fla. App. 1987) (holding that buyer’s damages should include the vendor’s subsequent profit from re-sale of the property).</p>
<p id="e12bdb03-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Retention of deposit.</i></b> The holding in <i>Kutzin</i>—that defaulting buyers are entitled to restitution of the deposit money in excess of damages incurred—is a minority view. The general rule, as the <i>Kutzin</i> court recognizes, holds that when a buyer breaches a contract to purchase land, the seller may elect to retain the down payment, because of “the difficulty of estimating actual damages and the general acceptance of the traditional 10% down payment as a reasonable amount,” even if the sales contract has no liquidated damages provision. See Maxton Builders, Inc. v. Lo Galbo, 502 N.E.2d 184, 189 (N.Y. 1986). If the seller does elect to retain the deposit, most courts hold that she is limited to deposit money totaling 10 percent of the contract price or less.</p>
<p id="e12bdb04-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most courts limit the retention-of-deposit remedy to 10 percent of the contract price (or less) to avoid imposing a penalty on the breaching party. Efficient breach theory suggests that when the cost of breach (damages) is less than the potential gain from breach (due to changing market conditions), breach of the contract is the economically efficient result. The theory depends on damages being reasonably certain and foreseeable. If excessive damages are imposed—whether by way of deposit retention or liquidated damages clauses—then the cost of breach is large, perhaps inducing parties to stay in economically inefficient contracts. This rationale was extended in <i>Kutzin</i> to include deposits not in excess of 10 percent.</p>
<p id="e12bdb05-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many real estate sales contracts do contain liquidated damages clauses. “It has long been the law that when contracting parties stipulate the amount of damage that shall be paid in the event of breach of contract, such stipulation is generally enforceable, so long as the stipulated amount is not disproportionate to the damage actually sustained.” Hutcheson v. Gleave, 632 P.2d 815, 817 (Utah 1981).</p>
<p id="e12bdb06-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Specific performance.</i></b> Specific performance—a judicial order that a breached contract be fulfilled as originally agreed—is relatively unusual in the case of contracts for the sale of goods, but very common in the case of contracts for the sale of land; an aggrieved seller or buyer of land is broadly entitled to elect that remedy. See, e.g., Wiggins v. Shewmake, 374 N.W.2d 111 (S.D. 1985). Behind this general rule is the thought that each piece of real estate is unique, making damages an inadequate remedy. But some courts have begun to depart from this general practice, applying ordinary contract (damages) remedies in appropriate cases. For example, the court in Lakshman v. Vecchione, 430 N.E.2d 199 (Ill. App. 1981), held that a grant of specific performance is not a matter of absolute right, but rather in discretion of the trial court. On this view, parties who wish to elect the remedy of specific performance have to prove that money damages would be an inadequate remedy.</p>
<p id="e12bdb07-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts have been particularly hesitant to automatically award specific performance to condominium sellers, presumably based upon the absence of uniqueness among homes in a development. See Centex Homes Corp. v. Boag, 320 A.2d 194 (N.J. Ch. 1974). Though <i>Centex</i> provides a theoretical basis for undermining <span title="388" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-388">p. 388</span>the availability of specific performance, it is still a minority opinion. For example, Giannini v. First Natl. Bank of Des Plaines, 483 N.E.2d 924, 933 (Ill. App. 1985), upheld the availability of specific performance for condominium purchasers, concluding that “where land, or any estate therein, is the subject matter of the agreement, the inadequacy of the legal remedy is well settled, and the equitable jurisdiction is firmly established.”</p>
<p id="e12bdb08-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Seller’s breach due to title defect.</i></b> There is a breach if the seller in a real estate contract is unable to convey marketable title as stipulated in the agreement. But in this setting, about half the jurisdictions in the United States follow the English rule (sometimes referred to as the <i>Flureau</i> rule, after Flureau v. Thornhill, 96 Eng. Rep. 635 (Common Pleas 1176)) and “limit the buyer’s recovery to his down payment plus interest and reasonable expenses incurred in investigating the title; only if the seller has acted in bad faith or has assumed the risk of a failure to secure title will he be liable for ordinary contract damages.” Large v. Gregory, 417 N.E.2d 1160, 1163 (Ind. App. 1981). The American rule, which is gradually becoming the dominant position, allows the purchaser to recover expectation (benefit-of-the-bargain) damages, plus any other reasonably foreseeable special damages. Donovan v. Bachstadt, 453 A.2d 160, 163-164 (N.J. 1982). The English rule developed in response to uncertainties regarding English title to land in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. American recording systems, while by no means perfect, are much more reliable, leading many commentators to conclude that there is no good reason to deprive innocent purchasers from recovering damages, “irrespective of the good or bad faith of the seller.” <i>Donovan</i>, 453 A.2d at 164.</p>
<p id="e12bdb09-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. <i>Time-of-the-essence clauses.</i></b> Unless the parties expressly provide that “time is of the essence,” a court will give the parties a reasonable time for performance, and either party can fix the time for performance by giving notice to the other, provided the notice leaves a reasonable time for rendering performance. See DeMattia v. Mauro, 860 A.2d 262 (Conn. App. 2004). Notice that paragraphs 5 and 28 of the Residential Real Estate Contract (see pages 350, 356) provide for a closing date as well as a time-of-the-essence clause. Under what circumstances might a seller or purchaser want the contract to include such a clause?</p>

<p id="e12c021e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Three types of deeds are used today: <i>general warranty deed</i>, <i>special warranty deed</i>, and <i>quitclaim deed</i>. They differ in the amount of protection they provide. A <i>general warranty deed</i> provides the greatest degree of protection, warranting title against all defects in title, whether they arose before or after the grantor took title. A <i>special warranty deed</i> comes next in terms of degree of protection. It contains warranties only against the grantor’s own acts but not the acts of others. Thus, if the defect is a mortgage on the land executed by the grantor’s predecessors in ownership, the grantor is not liable. A <i>quitclaim deed</i> contains no warranties of any kind. It merely conveys whatever title the grantor has, if any, and if the grantee of a quitclaim deed takes nothing by the deed, the grantee cannot sue the grantor.</p>

<p id="e12c505b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Consideration.</i></b> It is customary to state in a deed that some consideration was paid by the grantee, in order to raise a presumption that the grantee is a bona fide purchaser entitled to the protection of the recording acts against prior unrecorded instruments. See page 426. It is neither customary nor necessary to state the exact consideration given. Do you see why?</p>
<p id="e12c505c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Acknowledgment.</i></b> In almost all states, a deed signed by the grantor, and delivered, is valid without an acknowledgment before a notary public. However, in order for the deed to be recorded in the courthouse, giving notice to the world of the grantee’s interest, the deed must be acknowledged by the grantor (in some states, witnessing is permitted in place of acknowledgment). Therefore, as a matter of practice, all deeds prepared by professionals are acknowledged.</p>
<p id="e12c505d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Description of tract.</i></b> A deed must contain a description of the parcel of land conveyed that locates the parcel by describing its boundaries. Customary methods of description include (1) reference to natural or artificial monuments and, from the starting point, reference to directions and distances (“metes and bounds”); (2) reference to a government survey, recorded plat, or some other record; and (3) reference to the street and number or the name of the property.</p>
<p id="e12c505e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are many cases, particularly old ones, litigating the correct boundaries of a tract of land. When this country was settled, deed descriptions of land were very informal. They might refer to “Hester Quinn’s farm” or to a tract “beginning at the old oak tree near the road and running 30 feet north, thence 70 feet east to the creek, thence south along the creek to an iron post, thence back to the beginning.” In time, the reference points frequently disappeared.</p>
<p id="e12c505f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Seal.</i></b> An old saw says a deed to land is effective when it is signed, sealed, and delivered. The requirement of a signed document was initiated by the Statute of Frauds in 1677. The requirement of sealing is older, going back to the Norman Conquest, when a seal replaced the sign of the cross on documents. If a person had no seal, he borrowed someone else’s. At common law, a “deed” was defined as a sealed instrument; a sealed instrument was required for the conveyance of a freehold. Most state legislatures have abolished the distinction between sealed and unsealed instruments. Where still extant, the requirement of a seal on transfers of real property is formal in the purest sense. Almost anything can be a seal: the word <i>seal</i>, the initials L.S. (standing for <i>locus sigilli</i>, the place of the seal), a ribbon, a scrawl, a scratch.</p>
<p id="e12c5060-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. <i>Forgery and fraud.</i></b> A forged deed is void. The grantor whose signature is forged to a deed prevails over all persons, including subsequent bona fide purchasers from the grantee who do not know the deed is forged.</p>
<p id="e12c5061-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, most courts hold that a deed procured by fraud is voidable by the grantor in an action against the grantee, but a subsequent bona fide purchaser from the grantee who is unaware of the fraud prevails over the grantor. The grantor, having introduced the deed into the stream of commerce, made it possible for a subsequent innocent purchaser to suffer loss. As between two innocent persons, one of whom must suffer by the act of the fraudulent third party, the law generally places the loss on the person who could have prevented the loss to the other.</p>

<p id="e12c5064-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">1. <i>A covenant of seisin</i>—The grantor warrants that he owns the estate that he purports to convey.</p>
<p id="e12c7775-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">2. <i>A covenant of right to convey</i>—The grantor warrants that he has the right to convey the property. In most instances this covenant serves the same purpose as the covenant of seisin, but it is possible for a person who has seisin not to have the right to convey (e.g., a trustee may have legal title but be forbidden by the trust instrument to convey it).</p>
<p id="e12c7776-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">3. <i>A covenant against encumbrances</i>—The grantor warrants that there are no encumbrances on the property. Encumbrances include, among other items, mortgages, liens, easements, and covenants.</p>
<p id="e12c7777-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">4. <i>A covenant of general warranty</i>—The grantor warrants that he will defend against lawful claims and will compensate the grantee for any loss that the grantee may sustain by assertion of superior title.</p>
<p id="e12c7778-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">5. <i>A covenant of quiet enjoyment</i>—The grantor warrants that the grantee will not be disturbed in possession and enjoyment of the property by assertion of superior title. This covenant is, for all practical purposes, identical with the covenant of general warranty and is often omitted from general warranty deeds.</p>
<p id="e12c7779-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">6. <i>A covenant of further assurances</i>—The grantor promises that he will execute any other documents required to perfect the title conveyed.</p>
<p id="e12c777a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Observe that the first three covenants are phrased in the present tense and are called <i>present covenants.</i> The last three covenants are phrased in the future tense and are called <i>future covenants.</i> The distinction is this: a present covenant is broken, if ever, at the time the deed is delivered. Either the grantor owns the property at that time, or he does not; either there are existing encumbrances at that time, or there are none. A future covenant promises that the grantor will do some future act, such as defending against claims of third parties or compensating the grantee for loss by virtue of failure of title. A future covenant is not breached until the grantee or his successor is evicted from the property, buys up the paramount claim, or is otherwise damaged.</p>
<p id="e12c777b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statute of limitations begins to run on a breach of a present covenant at the date of delivery of the deed.

In 1957, the Bosts conveyed the 80-acre tract to James R. Brown and his wife by a general warranty deed containing no exceptions. In 1974, the Browns contracted to sell the mineral rights to Consolidated Coal Co. for $6,000, but upon finding that the Browns owned only one-third of the mineral rights the parties had to renegotiate the contract to provide for payment of $2,000 for one-third of the mineral rights.

The 10-year statute of limitations barred a suit on the present covenants, so the Browns sued the executor of the Bosts, who had died, seeking $4,000 damages for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

The question is whether plaintiffs have alleged facts sufficient to constitute a constructive eviction. They argue that if a covenantee fails in his effort to sell an interest in land because he discovers that he does not own what his warranty deed purported to convey, he has suffered a constructive eviction and is thereby entitled to bring an action against his grantor for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. We think that the decision of this court in Scott v. Kirkendall, 88 Ill. 465 (1878), is controlling on this issue and compels us to reject plaintiffs’ argument.</p>
<p id="e12c9e93-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Scott</i>, an action was brought for breach of the covenant of warranty by a grantee who discovered that other parties had paramount title to the land in question. The land was vacant and unoccupied at all relevant times. This court, in rejecting the grantee’s claim that there was a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, quoted the earlier decision in Moore v. Vail, 17 Ill. 185, 191 (1855): “‘Until that time, (the taking possession by the owner of the paramount title,) he might peaceably have entered upon and enjoyed the premises, without resistance or molestation, which was all his grantors covenanted he should do. They did not guarantee to him a perfect title, but the possession and enjoyment of the premises.”’ 88 Ill. 465, 468.</p>
<p id="e12c9e94-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Relying on this language in <i>Moore</i>, the <i>Scott</i> court concluded:</p>

<p id="e12c9e95-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not see but what this fully decides the present case against the appellant. It holds that the mere existence of a paramount title does not constitute a breach of the covenant. That is all there is here. There has been no assertion of the adverse title. The land has always been vacant. Appellant could at any time have taken peaceable possession of it. He has in no way been prevented or hindered from the enjoyment of the possession by any one having a better right. It was but the possession and enjoyment of the premises which was assured to him, and there has been no disturbance or interference in that respect. True, there is a superior title in another, but appellant has never felt “its pressure upon him.” [88 Ill. 465, 468-469.]</p>

<p id="e12c9e96-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Admittedly, <i>Scott</i> dealt with surface rights while the case before us concerns subsurface mineral rights. We are, nevertheless, convinced that the reasoning employed in <i>Scott</i> is applicable to the present case. While plaintiffs went into possession of the surface area, they cannot be said to have possessed the subsurface minerals. “Possession of the surface does not carry possession of the minerals. . . . To possess the mineral estate, one must undertake the actual removal thereof from the ground or do such other act as will apprise the community that such interest is in the exclusive use and enjoyment of the claiming party.” Failoni v. Chicago &amp; North Western Ry. Co., 30 Ill. 2d 258, 262, 195 N.E.2d 619, 622 (1964).</p>
<p id="e12c9e97-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since no one has, as yet, undertaken to remove the coal or otherwise manifested a clear intent to exclusively “possess” the mineral estate, it must be concluded that the subsurface estate is “vacant.” As in <i>Scott</i>, plaintiffs “could at any time have taken peaceable possession of it. [They have] in no way been prevented or hindered from the enjoyment of the possession by any one having a better right.” (88 Ill. 465, 468.) Accordingly, until such time as one holding paramount title interferes with plaintiffs’ <span title="393" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-393">p. 393</span>right of possession (e.g., by beginning to mine the coal), there can be no constructive eviction and, therefore, no breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.</p>
<p id="e12c9e98-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What plaintiffs are apparently attempting to do on this appeal is to extend the protection afforded by the covenant of quiet enjoyment. However, we decline to expand the historical scope of this covenant to provide a remedy where another of the covenants of title is so clearly applicable. As this court stated in Scott v. Kirkendall, 88 Ill. 465, 469 (1878): “To sustain the present action would be to confound all distinction between the covenant of warranty and that of seisin, or of right to convey. They are not equivalent covenants. An action will lie upon the latter, though there be no disturbance of possession. A defect of title will suffice. Not so with the covenant of warranty, or for quiet enjoyment, as has always been held by the prevailing authority.” The covenant of seisin, unquestionably, was breached when the Bosts delivered the deed to plaintiffs, and plaintiffs then had a cause of action. However, despite the fact that it was a matter of public record that there was a reservation of a two-thirds interest in the mineral rights in the earlier deed, plaintiffs failed to bring an action for breach of the covenant of seisin within the 10-year period following delivery of the deed. The likely explanation is that plaintiffs had not secured a title opinion at the time they purchased the property. . . . Plaintiffs’ oversight, however, does not justify us in overruling earlier decisions in order to recognize an otherwise premature cause of action. The mere fact that plaintiffs’ original contract with Consolidated had to be modified due to their discovery that paramount title to two-thirds of the subsurface minerals belonged to another is not sufficient to constitute the constructive eviction necessary to a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.</p>

<p id="e12cc5af-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is considerable conflict among the authorities as to whether or not a visible or known easement is excepted from a covenant against encumbrances. A distinction is made in some cases between encumbrances which affect the title and those which simply affect the physical condition of the land. In the first class, it is universally held that the encumbrances are included in the covenant, regardless of the knowledge of the grantee. Those encumbrances relating to physical conditions of the property have, in many instances, been treated as excluded from the covenant. Some of these cases are decided upon the theory that, whenever the actual physical conditions of the realty are apparent, and are in their nature permanent and irremediable, such conditions are within the contemplation of the parties when contracting, and are therefore not included in a general covenant against encumbrances.</p>
<span title="394" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-394">p. 394</span>
<p id="e12cc5b0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There seems to be a tendency toward the proposition that certain visible public easements, such as highways and railroad rights of way, in open and notorious use at the time of the conveyance, do not breach a covenant against encumbrances. However, it still seems to be the general rule, particularly in those cases involving private rights of way, that an easement which is a burden upon the estate granted and which diminishes its value constitutes a breach of the covenant against encumbrances in the deed, regardless of whether the grantee had knowledge of its existence or that it was visible and notorious.</p>
<p id="e12cc5b1-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Certainly, if the deed contains anything which would indicate that a known encumbrance was not intended to be within the covenant, the purchaser cannot complain that such an encumbrance was a breach of the covenant. However, with the possible exception of public easements that are apparent and in their nature permanent and irremediable, mere knowledge of the encumbrance is not sufficient to exclude it from the operation of the covenant. The intention to exclude an encumbrance should be manifested in the deed itself, for a resort to oral or other extraneous evidence would violate settled principles of law in regard to deeds.

<p id="e12cc5b4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To be effective, a deed must be delivered with the intent that it be presently effective. Delivery is rarely an issue in commercial transactions. Either the grantor hands the deed to the grantee upon receipt of the purchase price, or the grantor puts the deed in the hands of a third party (an escrow agent) who hands over the deed upon closing the transaction. In the first case, the grantor intends to make an immediate transfer of title to the grantee. In the second, the grantor intends to transfer title when all conditions are fulfilled. If there is an enforceable contract of sale, the escrow agent is the agent of both the grantor and grantee. The grantor cannot recall the deed from the agent. When the agent delivers the deed to the grantee, if necessary to carry out the parties’ intent and do equity, the title of the grantee will “relate back” to the date the grantor handed the deed to the agent. For example, if the grantor dies before the escrow agent delivers the deed, the delivery of the deed by the agent is treated as if it occurred before the grantor’s death. By this fiction the rule that a will is required to pass title at death is avoided. Title is regarded as having been transferred to the grantee during the grantor’s life.</p>

Maurice Sweeney, plaintiff’s intestate, hereinafter called Maurice, deeded his farm to his brother John M. Sweeney, hereinafter called John, and the deed was <span title="395" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-395">p. 395</span>recorded. John deeded the property back to Maurice. This deed is unrecorded and was accidentally burned. The question to be decided is whether the second deed was delivered and if so, whether or not a condition claimed to be attached to the delivery is operative. This must be determined on the finding. The following statement includes such changes therein as are required by the evidence:</p>
<p id="e12ceccc-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff is the widow and administratrix of Maurice but had not lived with him for the twenty years preceding his death in September, 1938, at the age of seventy-three years. Maurice lived on a tract of land of some hundred and thirty-five acres which he owned in East Hampton, where he ran a tavern. John assisted him in running the tavern to some extent. On February 2, 1937, Maurice and John went to the town clerk’s office in East Hampton pursuant to an appointment made the preceding day. Maurice requested the town clerk to draw a deed of his East Hampton property to John and this was done. At the same time he requested that a deed be prepared from John to himself so that he, Maurice, would be protected if John predeceased him. Both deeds were duly executed. The first was left for recording and the second was taken away by Maurice and never recorded. A week or two later Maurice took to John the recorded deed and a week or two after that took the unrecorded deed to John’s house. John kept both deeds and gave the second deed to his attorney after the institution of this action. It was destroyed when the latter’s office was burned. After the execution of the deeds, Maurice continued to occupy the property, paid the fixed charges, received the rents and exercised full dominion over it until his death. In April, 1937, Maurice made a written lease to Ernest Myers of a portion of the premises and on June 18, 1938, a written lease to Frank and Esther Fricke for twenty years. The first lease is lost but the second was recorded. The defendant never collected any money from tenants or paid any fixed charges or repairs prior to the death of Maurice. On these facts the trial court concluded that there was no intention to make present delivery of John’s deed to Maurice, that there was no delivery or acceptance thereof, that it was not intended to operate until John’s death and rendered judgment for the defendant.</p>
<p id="e12ceccd-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This deed was, in effect, manually delivered. Maurice continued to occupy the property and exercised full dominion over it without interference by John. It follows that all the essentials of a good delivery were present unless there is something in the contentions of John which defeats this result. He claims that there was no intention on his part to make present delivery.</p>
<p id="e12cecce-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is, of course, true that physical possession of a duly executed deed is not conclusive proof that it was legally delivered. McDermott v. McDermott, 97 Conn. 31, 34, 115 Atl. 638. This is so under some circumstances even where there has been a manual delivery. Hotaling v. Hotaling, 193 Cal. 368, 381, 224 Pac. 455, 56 A.L.R. 734, and note p. 746. Delivery must be made with the intent to pass title if it is to be effective. Porter v. Woodhouse, 59 Conn. 568, 575, 22 Atl. 299; McDermott v. McDermott, supra.</p>
<p id="e12ceccf-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The deed having been in effect actually delivered to Maurice, the execution of the attestation clause was prima facia proof that the deed was delivered. New Haven Trust Co. v. Camp, 81 Conn. 539, 542, 71 Atl. 788. There is a rebuttable presumption that the grantee assented since the deed was beneficial to him. Moore v. Giles, 49 Conn. 570, 573. No fact is found which militates against this presumption. Where deeds are formally executed and delivered, these presumptions can be overcome only <span title="396" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-396">p. 396</span>by evidence that no delivery was in fact intended. Loughran v. Kummer, 297 Pa. St. 179, 183, 146 Atl. 534; Cragin’s Estate, 274 Pa. St. 1, 5, 117 Atl. 445; Stewart v. Silva, 192 Cal. 405, 409, 221 Pac. 191. The only purpose in making the deed expressed by either party was the statement by Maurice that it was to protect him in case John predeceased him. Since this purpose would have been defeated had there been no delivery with intent to pass title, this conclusively establishes the fact that there was a legal delivery.</p>
<p id="e12cecd0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant next claims that if there was a delivery, it was on condition and that the condition (the death of John before that of Maurice) was not and cannot be fulfilled. This claim is not good because the delivery was to the grantee. “A conditional delivery is and can only be made by placing the deed in the hands of a third person to be kept by him until the happening of the event upon the happening of which the deed is to be delivered over by the third person to the grantee.” Porter v. Woodhouse, supra, 574; Raymond v. Smith, 5 Conn. 555, 559. Conditional delivery to a grantee vests absolute title in the latter. As is pointed out in the <i>Loughran</i> case, supra, this is one of the instances where a positive rule of law may defeat the actual intention of the parties. The safety of real estate titles is considered more important than the unfortunate results which may follow the application of the rule in a few individual instances. To relax it would open the door wide to fraud and the fabrication of evidence. Although the doctrine has been criticized (2 Tiffany, Real Property [2d Ed.] p. 1764; 5 Wigmore, Evidence [2d ed.] §§2405, 2408) no material change has been noted in the attitude of the courts in this country.</p>
<p id="e12cecd1-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The finding does not support the conclusion. The finding shows a delivery and, even if a conditional delivery is assumed, the condition is not good for the reasons stated. Since a new trial is necessary, the one ruling on evidence made a ground of appeal is noticed. The town clerk was permitted to testify to certain statements made by Maurice when the deed was drafted. Parol evidence is not admissible to vary the terms of the deed but may be received to show the use that was to be made of it. Fisk’s Appeal, 81 Conn. 433, 437, 71 Atl. 559. The ruling was correct as showing the circumstances surrounding delivery.</p>

Stat. §5156 (1930) gave the surviving spouse an elective share of a life estate in one-third of decedent’s property in his probate estate. Dower had long been abolished. If decedent died intestate, as Maurice did, §5156 gave his surviving spouse one-third absolutely; if no issue or parent of the decedent survived, §5156 gave the surviving spouse all of the estate of the decedent. From the facts it appears that Maurice was survived by his estranged wife Maria and his brother John. If so, under Connecticut law Maria took all of Maurice’s property.</p>

<p id="e12d13e8-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(a) <i>No delivery</i>. When the deed is handed over to the grantee but the extrinsic evidence shows that the deed is to “take effect” at the death of the grantor, a few courts have held that there is no delivery and that the transfer is testamentary and void. See William B. Stoebuck &amp; Dale A. Whitman, The Law of Property §11.3 at 830 (3d ed. 2000).</p>
<p id="e12d13e9-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(b) <i>Delivery good and condition enforced</i>. Chillemi v. Chillemi, 78 A.2d 750 (Md. 1951), rejected the <i>Sweeney</i> rule, on particularly compelling facts. <i>H</i>, going overseas on a dangerous military mission, delivered a deed to <i>W</i> with oral instructions that if <i>H</i> was killed, <i>W</i> was to record the deed, and if <i>H</i> returned from the mission, the deed was to be returned to <i>H</i> and destroyed. One month after <i>H</i>’s return, and following considerable marital squabbling, <i>W</i> recorded the deed. The court upheld the oral conditions and annulled the deed. A more recent decision, Blancett v. Blancett, 102 P.3d 640 (N.M. 2004), rejects a per se rule against conditional deliveries of deeds. Instead the court holds that physical delivery creates a rebuttable presumption of a present transfer.</p>
<p id="e12d13ea-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Question.</i></b> Seller is ready to deliver a deed to buyer, but buyer does not yet have the money. Seller says to buyer, “I’ll give you this deed now on condition that you pay me by the first of next month.” Buyer takes the deed and records, but subsequently does not pay. If the <i>Sweeney</i> case is followed, what is seller’s remedy? Compare Gilbert ex rel. Roberts v. Rainey, 71 S.W.3d 66 (Ark. App. 2002), with State ex rel. Pai v. Thom, 563 P.2d 982 (Haw. 1977).</p>

<p id="e12d13eb-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center ">______________________</p>
<p id="e12d13ec-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Delivery without handing over.</i></b> To deliver a deed of land, it is not necessary that the deed be “handed over” to the grantee. “Delivery” means no more than an act that evinces an intent to be immediately bound by the transfer. The act can be, of course, handing over the document to the grantee, but it can also be the grantor’s declaration, express or implied, that he is bound by his deed. The traditional view was put by Sir Edward Coke with his usual felicity: “As a deed may be delivered to the party without words, so may a deed be delivered by words without any act of delivery.” 1 Co. Litt. 36A.</p>
<p id="e12d13ed-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The most common case of delivery without manual delivery arises when the grantor executes a deed and places it in a safe deposit box, usually with the thought that the grantee will “take” the land at the grantor’s death. If the grantor intends to pass title or a future interest to the grantee <i>now</i>, there has been a delivery even though possession may be postponed until the grantor’s death. On the other hand, if the grantor intends that no interest should arise until death, no delivery during life has taken place; the deed cannot take legal effect at death because the grantor intended it to be a will, not a deed, and the instrument is not executed with two witnesses in accordance with the Statute of Wills. Laypersons often do not know about the sharp distinction the law draws between an <i>inter vivos transfer of land</i>, requiring the delivery of a signed instrument, and a <i>transfer at death</i>, requiring an instrument complying with the Statute of Wills.</p>

Recall that Bob and Betty applied for a loan to pay the balance of the purchase price beyond the down payment. Suppose Last National Bank agrees to make the loan. To assure repayment of the loan the Byars will provide two important documents to the bank: (1) a <i>promissory note</i>, indicating the purchasers’ contractual commitment to repay; and (2) a <i>mortgage</i>, which secures the lender’s note. The Byars are the mortgagors; the bank is the mortgagee. If the Byars fail to pay their note or do not otherwise perform their obligations, the bank can have the property sold (“foreclose the mortgage”) and apply the proceeds of sale to the amount due on the note.</p>
<p id="e12d3b03-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>An alternative security device: the installment land sale contract.</i></b> A mortgage is the usual instrument for securing repayment, but in some cases an arrangement known as an <i>installment land sale contract</i> may be used. In Section B of this chapter, beginning at page 362, we considered various aspects of the Contract of Sale. Don’t confuse the Contract of Sale with the installment land sale contract of contract device. Unlike the contract for the sale of land considered earlier, the installment land sale contract is a security device, a substitute for conventional mortgages. It is usually referred to as an <i>installment land contract</i>, or a <i>contract for deed</i>, or a <i>lease to own contract</i>. In each case, the device works like this: the buyer takes possession of the land immediately, but the seller contracts to deliver title to the buyer only after the buyer has paid the purchase price plus interest in regular installments over a fixed period of time. </p>
<p id="e12d3b04-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is little functional difference between a purchase money mortgage and an installment land sale contract, in that both are designed to secure payment of the sales price, yet all sorts of problems arise in practice. The installment contract commonly specifies that the property is transferred “as is,” and provides that in the event of default the buyer forfeits the land and any payments already made. Financing is provided by the seller, not a bank or other institutional lender, and for this reason it is widely used in transfers of low-cost housing to buyers who have insufficient funds or an adequate credit record to qualify for loans from institutional lenders, to obtain a title search, to hire lawyers for advice at the outset – or to assist them in the case of default. Hence, even though many states provide protection for buyers by treating installment contracts just as they do mortgages, still poorly informed buyers regularly just walk away from their installment contract deals when they can no longer afford to make payments. Obviously, then, installment contracts are attractive to unscrupulous sellers, and use of the contracts has increased considerably in recent years. </p>
<p id="e12d3b05-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A recent variation of the installment sale contract is the lease-to-sell arrangement. The basic difference between the two is that unlike an installment sale contract, in the typical lease-to-sell the tenant still needs to find financing to obtain title. Some leases require tenants to pay for any repairs (is this term legally enforceable in states with a non-waivable warranty of habitability?), and consumer-protection regulations like the federal Truth in Lending Act, which <span title="399" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-399">p. 399</span>apply to installment sale contracts, do not apply to leases-to-sell. A report from the National Consumer Law Center states that many such leases were “built to fail” and were predatory in nature.

<p id="e12d3b06-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Title vs. lien theories of mortgages.</i></b> Under the traditional form of mortgage, the mortgagee takes legal title to the land; the mortgagor has only the equity of redemption. This approach is called the “title theory” of mortgages and is still retained in about a dozen states. Most states subscribe to the “lien theory,” which disregards the form and holds that the mortgagor keeps legal title and the mortgagee has only a lien on the property. Although this distinction used to count for a lot, the differences in practical application between “title theory” and “lien theory” states have almost entirely disappeared because title theory states have come to see that title passes to the mortgagee only for purposes of securing the debt and have interpreted the mortgage accordingly.</p>
<p id="e12d3b07-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">About half the states have passed statutes giving the mortgagor a statutory right to buy back the title from the purchaser at a judicial foreclosure sale for the sales price (plus costs) within a specified period after the foreclosure sale (ranging from three months to two years). These statutes were usually enacted in periods of depression or collapse of land values. Make sure you distinguish between the statutory right to redeem from the purchaser at foreclosure sale and the judicially created right to redeem from the mortgagee (the so-called equity of redemption, or “equity” for short), on the one hand. The statutory right does not come into play until the borrower’s equity is extinguished at foreclosure sale.</p>
<p id="e12d3b08-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although virtually all states that recognize power of sale foreclosures specify procedural safeguards including notice and public sale, this method of foreclosure is quicker and less costly than judicial foreclosure. Except for the power to foreclose without resort to judicial sale, the deed of trust is treated in almost all significant respects as a mortgage.</p>
<p id="e12d3b09-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Changes in the home mortgage market.</i></b> In the early 1980s, when interest rates on home mortgage loans went up to 16 percent or more, financial institutions began to experiment with adjustable rate loans. Such loans, still widely used, feature an initial below-market interest rate that gradually increases according to an index based on debt issued by the Federal Reserve Bank. Typically, an adjustable rate mortgage loan can go up or down by a limited amount each year and has a lifetime cap.</p>
<p id="e12d3b0a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Beginning in the late 1990s, there has been tremendous and sometimes convulsive change in the home loan mortgage market. Increasing automation, the growth of the secondary mortgage market, the increasing detachment between origination and investment in mortgage debt, a desire to extend homeownership to underserved groups, and increasing competition in the industry led to a profusion of mortgage instruments. Only three decades ago, home mortgage lending was a “one size fits all” industry where would-be borrowers either qualified for a loan or did not, and if they did were given a standard fixed-rate or adjustable-rate loan at a set interest rate. But by 2005, risk-based lending was in full swing and seemingly no matter how risky one’s profile, a mortgage loan of some sort could be obtained . . . at a price.</p>
<span title="400" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-400">p. 400</span>
<p id="e12d3b0b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This increasingly risky segment of the mortgage market is often categorized as the subprime market or the Alt-A market. The prime market provides loans to people with high credit scores, fairly typical loan-to-value ratios of 80 or 90 percent, and characteristics that meet standard underwriting criteria. The subprime and Alt-A markets, on the other hand, made loans available to people with low credit scores and sometimes unverifiable income. Loan instruments often combined low “teaser” rates for two years with much higher rates for the remainder of the term. Oftentimes, borrowers were allowed to borrow 100 percent or more of the value of the properties they were purchasing. In some instances, they paid less than the full interest accruing on the debt, which led to the growth rather than the decline of mortgage principal (sometimes referred to as “negative amortization”). As described later in this chapter, the economic slowdown and then the deep recession that the United States experienced beginning in 2007 led this house of cards to collapse and resulted in unprecedented waves of mortgage default and foreclosure, the collapse and bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and ultimately the deepest recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</p>

The plaintiffs brought this action seeking to set aside the foreclosure sale of their home, or, in the alternative, money damages. The Superior Court (Bean, J.), adopting the recommendation of a Master (R. Peter Shapiro, Esq.), entered a judgment for the plaintiffs in the amount of $27,000 against two of the defendants, Financial Development Corporation and Colonial Deposit Company (the lenders).</p>
<p id="e12d6224-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiffs purchased a house in Nashua in 1966, financing it by means of a mortgage loan. They refinanced the loan in March of 1980, executing a new promissory note and a power of sale mortgage, with Financial Development Corporation as mortgagee. The note and mortgage were later assigned to Colonial Deposit Company.</p>
<p id="e12d6225-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In February of 1981, the plaintiff Richard Murphy became unemployed. By September of 1981, the plaintiffs were seven months in arrears on their mortgage payments, and had also failed to pay substantial amounts in utility assessments and real estate taxes. After discussing unsuccessfully with the plaintiffs proposals for revising the payment schedule, rewriting the note, and arranging alternative financing, the lenders gave notice on October 6, 1981, of their intent to foreclose.</p>
<p id="e12d6226-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During the following weeks, the plaintiffs made a concerted effort to avoid foreclosure. They paid the seven months’ mortgage arrearage, but failed to pay some $643.18 in costs and legal fees associated with the foreclosure proceedings. The lenders scheduled the foreclosure sale for November 10, 1981, at the site of the subject property. They complied with all of the statutory requirements for notice. See RSA 479:25.</p>
<p id="e12d6227-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the plaintiffs’ request, the lenders agreed to postpone the sale until December 15, 1981. They advised the plaintiffs that this would entail an additional cost of $100, and that the sale would proceed unless the lenders received payment of $743.18, as <span title="401" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-401">p. 401</span>well as all mortgage payments then due, by December 15. Notice of the postponement was posted on the subject property on November 10 at the originally scheduled time of the sale, and was also posted at the Nashua City Hall and Post Office. No prospective bidders were present for the scheduled sale.</p>
<p id="e12d8938-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In late November, the plaintiffs paid the mortgage payment which had been due in October, but made no further payments to the lenders. An attempt by the lenders to arrange new financing for the plaintiffs through a third party failed when the plaintiffs refused to agree to pay for a new appraisal of the property. Early on the morning of December 15, 1981, the plaintiffs tried to obtain a further postponement, but were advised by the lenders’ attorney that it was impossible unless the costs and legal fees were paid.</p>
<p id="e12d8939-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the plaintiffs’ request, the attorney called the president of Financial Development Corporation, who also refused to postpone the sale. Further calls by the plaintiffs to the lenders’ office were equally unavailing.</p>
<p id="e12d893a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The sale proceeded as scheduled at 10:00 A<span class="epub-small-caps">.M</span>. on December 15, at the site of the property. Although it had snowed the previous night, the weather was clear and warm at the time of the sale, and the roads were clear. The only parties present were the plaintiffs, a representative of the lenders, and an attorney, Morgan Hollis, who had been engaged to conduct the sale because the lenders’ attorney, who lived in Dover, had been apprehensive about the weather the night before. The lenders’ representative made the only bid at the sale. That bid of $27,000, roughly the amount owed on the mortgage, plus costs and fees, was accepted and the sale concluded.</p>
<p id="e12d893b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Later that same day, Attorney Hollis encountered one of his clients, William Dube, a representative of the defendant Southern New Hampshire Home Traders, Inc. (Southern). On being informed of the sale, Mr. Dube contacted the lenders and offered to buy the property for $27,000. The lenders rejected the offer and made a counter offer of $40,000. Within two days a purchase price of $38,000 was agreed upon by Mr. Dube and the lenders and the sale was subsequently completed.</p>
<p id="e12d893c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiffs commenced this action on February 5, 1982. The lenders moved to dismiss, arguing that any action was barred because the plaintiffs had failed to petition for an injunction prior to the sale. The master denied the motion. After hearing the evidence, he ruled for the plaintiffs, finding that the lenders had “failed to exercise good faith and due diligence in obtaining a fair price for the subject property at the foreclosure sale. . . .”</p>
<p id="e12d893d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The master also ruled that Southern was a bona fide purchaser for value, and thus had acquired legal title to the house. That ruling is not at issue here. He assessed monetary damages against the lenders equal to “the difference between the fair market value of the subject property on the date of the foreclosure and the price obtained at said sale.”</p>
<p id="e12d893e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having found the fair market value to be $54,000, he assessed damages accordingly at $27,000. He further ruled that “[t]he bad faith of the ‘Lenders’ warrants an award of legal fees.” The lenders appealed. . . .</p>
<p id="e12d893f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The . . . issue before us is whether the master erred in concluding that the lenders had failed to comply with the often-repeated rule that a mortgagee executing a power of sale is bound both by the statutory procedural requirements <i>and</i> by a duty to protect the interests of the mortgagor through the exercise of good faith and due diligence. . . .</p>
<p id="e12d8940-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The master found that the lenders, throughout the time prior to the sale, “did not mislead or deal unfairly with the plaintiffs.” They engaged in serious efforts to avoid foreclosure through new financing, and agreed to one postponement of the sale. The <span title="402" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-402">p. 402</span>basis for the master’s decision was his conclusion that the lenders had failed to exercise good faith and due diligence in obtaining a fair price for the property.</p>
<p id="e12d8941-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This court’s past decisions have not dealt consistently with the question whether the mortgagee’s duty amounts to that of a fiduciary or trustee. This may be an inevitable result of the mortgagee’s dual role as seller and potential buyer at the foreclosure sale, and of the conflicting interests involved. See Wheeler v. Slocinski, 82 N.H. 211, 214, 131 A. 598, 600 (1926).</p>
<p id="e12d8942-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We need not label a duty, however, in order to define it. In his role as a seller, the mortgagee’s duty of good faith and due diligence is essentially that of a fiduciary. Such a view is in keeping with “[t]he ‘trend . . . towards liberalizing the term [fiduciary] in order to prevent unjust enrichment.”’ Lash v. Cheshire County Savings Bank, Inc., 124 N.H. 435, 438, 474 A.2d 980, 981 (1984) (quoting Cornwell v. Cornwell, 116 N.H. 205, 209, 356 A.2d 683, 686 (1976)).</p>
<p id="e12d8943-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A mortgagee, therefore, must exert every reasonable effort to obtain “a fair and reasonable price under the circumstances,” Reconstruction Finance Corp. v. Faulkner, 101 N.H. 352, 361, 143 A.2d 403, 410 (1958), even to the extent, if necessary, of adjourning the sale or of establishing “an upset price below which he will not accept any offer.” Lakes Region Fin. Corp. v. Goodhue Boat Yard, Inc., 118 N.H. 103, 107, 382 A.2d 1108, 1111 (1978).</p>
<p id="e12d8944-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What constitutes a fair price, or whether the mortgagee must establish an upset price, adjourn the sale, or make other reasonable efforts to assure a fair price, depends on the circumstances of each case. Inadequacy of price alone is not sufficient to demonstrate bad faith unless the price is so low as to shock the judicial conscience. . . .</p>
<p id="e12d8945-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We must decide, in the present case, whether the evidence supports the finding of the master that the lenders failed to exercise good faith and due diligence in obtaining a fair price for the plaintiffs’ property.</p>
<p id="e12d8946-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We first note that “[t]he duties of good faith and due diligence are distinct. . . . One may be observed and not the other, and any inquiry as to their breach calls for a separate consideration of each.” Wheeler v. Slocinski, 82 N.H. at 213, 131 A. at 600. In order “to constitute bad faith there must be an intentional disregard of duty or a purpose to injure.” Id. at 214, 131 A. at 600-01.</p>
<p id="e12d8947-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is insufficient evidence in the record to support the master’s finding that the lenders acted in bad faith in failing to obtain a fair price for the plaintiffs’ property. The lenders complied with the statutory requirements of notice and otherwise conducted the sale in compliance with statutory provisions. The lenders postponed the sale one time and did not bid with knowledge of any immediately available subsequent purchaser. Further, there is no evidence indicating an intent on the part of the lenders to injure the mortgagor by, for example, discouraging other buyers.</p>
<p id="e12d8948-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is ample evidence in the record, however, to support the master’s finding that the lenders failed to exercise due diligence in obtaining a fair price. “The issue of the lack of due diligence is whether a reasonable man in the [lenders’] place would have adjourned the sale,” id. at 215, 131 A. at 601, or taken other measures to receive a fair price.</p>
<p id="e12d8949-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In early 1980, the plaintiffs’ home was appraised at $46,000. At the time of the foreclosure sale on December 15, 1981, the lenders had not had the house reappraised to take into account improvements and appreciation. The master found that a reasonable person in the place of the lenders would have realized that the plaintiffs’ equity in the property was at least $19,000, the difference between the 1980 appraised value of $46,000 and the amount owed on the mortgage totaling approximately $27,000.</p>
<span title="403" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-403">p. 403</span>
<p id="e12d894a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the foreclosure sale, the lenders were the only bidders. The master found that their bid of $27,000 “was sufficient to cover all monies due and did not create a deficiency balance” but “did not provide for a return of any of the plaintiffs’ equity.”</p>
<p id="e12d894b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Further, the master found that the lenders “had reason to know” that “they stood to make a substantial profit on a quick turnaround sale.” On the day of the sale, the lenders offered to sell the foreclosed property to William Dube for $40,000. Within two days after the foreclosure sale, they did in fact agree to sell it to Dube for $38,000. It was not necessary for the master to find that the lenders knew of a specific potential buyer before the sale in order to show lack of good faith or due diligence as the lenders contend. The fact that the lenders offered the property for sale at a price sizably above that for which they had purchased it, only a few hours before, supports the master’s finding that the lenders had reason to know, at the time of the foreclosure sale, that they could make a substantial profit on a quick turnaround sale. For this reason, they should have taken more measures to ensure receiving a higher price at the sale.</p>
<p id="e12d894c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While a mortgagee may not always be required to secure a portion of the mortgagor’s equity, such an obligation did exist in this case. The substantial amount of equity which the plaintiffs had in their property, the knowledge of the lenders as to the appraised value of the property, and the plaintiffs’ efforts to forestall foreclosure by paying the mortgage arrearage within weeks of the sale, all support the master’s conclusion that the lenders had a fiduciary duty to take more reasonable steps than they did to protect the plaintiffs’ equity by attempting to obtain a fair price for the property. They could have established an appropriate upset price to assure a minimum bid. They also could have postponed the auction and advertised commercially by display advertising in order to assure that bidders other than themselves would be present.</p>
<p id="e12d894d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Instead, as Theodore DiStefano, an officer of both lending institutions testified, the lenders made no attempt to obtain fair market value for the property but were concerned <i>only</i> with making themselves “whole.” On the facts of this case, such disregard for the interests of the mortgagors was a breach of duty by the mortgagees.</p>
<p id="e12d894e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the lenders <i>did</i> comply with the statutory requirements of notice of the foreclosure sale, these efforts were not sufficient in this case to demonstrate due diligence. At the time of the initially scheduled sale, the extent of the lenders’ efforts to publicize the sale of the property was publication of a legal notice of the mortgagees’ sale at public auction on November 10, published once a week for three weeks in the Nashua Telegraph, plus postings in public places. The lenders did not advertise, publish, or otherwise give notice to the general public of postponement of the sale to December 15, 1981, other than by posting notices at the plaintiffs’ house, at the post office, and at city hall. That these efforts to advertise were ineffective is evidenced by the fact that no one, other than the lenders, appeared at the sale to bid on the property. This fact allowed the lenders to purchase the property at a minimal price and then to profit substantially in a quick turnaround sale.</p>
<p id="e12d894f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We recognize a need to give guidance to a trial court which must determine whether a mortgagee who has complied with the strict letter of the statutory law has nevertheless violated his additional duties of good faith and due diligence. A finding that the mortgagee had, or should have had, knowledge of his ability to get a higher price at an adjourned sale is the most conclusive evidence of such a violation.</p>
<p id="e12d8950-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More generally, we are in agreement with the official Commissioners’ Comment to section 3-508 of the Uniform Land Transactions Act:</p>

<p id="e12d8951-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The requirement that the sale be conducted in a reasonable manner, including the advertising aspects, requires that the person conducting the sale use the ordinary methods of making buyers aware that are used when an owner is voluntarily selling his land. Thus an advertisement in the portion of a daily newspaper where these ads are placed or, in appropriate cases such as the sale of an industrial plant, a display advertisement in the financial sections of the daily newspaper may be the most reasonable method. In other cases employment of a professional real estate agent may be the more reasonable method. It is unlikely that an advertisement in a legal publication among other legal notices would qualify as a commercially reasonable method of sale advertising.

<p id="e12db062-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As discussed above, the lenders met neither of these guidelines.</p>
<p id="e12db063-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While agreeing with the master that the lenders failed to exercise due diligence in this case, we find that he erred as a matter of law in awarding damages equal to “the difference between the fair market value of the subject property . . . and the price obtained at [the] sale.”</p>
<p id="e12db064-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Such a formula may well be the appropriate measure where <i>bad faith</i> is found. See Danvers Savings Bank v. Hammer, 122 N.H. 1, 5, 440 A.2d 435, 438 (1982). In such a case, a mortgagee’s conduct amounts to more than mere negligence. Damages based upon the <i>fair market value</i>, a figure in excess of a <i>fair</i> price, will more readily induce mortgagees to perform their duties properly. A “fair” price may or may not yield a figure close to fair market value; however, it will be that price arrived at as a result of due diligence by the mortgagee.</p>
<p id="e12db065-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where, as here, however, a mortgagee fails to exercise due diligence, the proper assessment of damages is the difference between a fair price for the property and the price obtained at the foreclosure sale. We have held, where lack of due diligence has been found, that “the test is not ‘fair market value’ as in eminent domain cases nor is the mortgagee bound to give credit for the highest possible amount which might be obtained under different circumstances, as at an owner’s sale.” Silver v. First National Bank, 108 N.H. 390, 392, 236 A.2d 493, 495 (1967) (quoting Reconstruction Finance Corp. v. Faulkner, 101 N.H. 352, 361, 143 A.2d 403, 410 (1958)) (citation omitted). Accordingly, we remand to the trial court for a reassessment of damages consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p id="e12db066-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because we concluded above that there was no “bad faith or obstinate, unjust, vexatious, wanton, or oppressive conduct,” on the part of the lenders, we see no reason to stray from our general rule that the prevailing litigant is not entitled to collect attorney’s fees from the loser. Harkeem v. Adams, 117 N.H. 687, 688, 377 A.2d 617, 617 (1977). Therefore, we reverse this part of the master’s decision.</p>

<p id="e12db06c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All jurisdictions adhere to the recognized rule that mere inadequacy of the foreclosure sale price will not invalidate a sale, absent fraud, unfairness or other irregularity. Courts <span title="405" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-405">p. 405</span>generally articulate two main standards for invalidating a foreclosure sale based on price. First, many courts state that inadequacy of the sale price is an insufficient ground unless it is so gross as to shock the conscience of the court, warranting an inference of fraud or imposition. Second, another significant group of courts require that, in the absence of some other defect in the foreclosure process, the price must be “grossly inadequate” before a sale may be invalidated. . . .</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="e12db06d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under either the “shock the conscience” or “grossly inadequate” standards, unless other foreclosure defects exist, it is extremely difficult to get a sale set aside on mere price inadequacy. While some courts have found that sales for one-seventh and one-sixtieth of fair market value “shock the conscience,” one commentator has noted with respect to his jurisdiction that “such sales have been upheld where the price paid for the property was only one-half, one-third, one-fourth, one-fifth, or even one-twentieth of its reasonable value.” On the other hand, where other factors are present, such as chilled bidding, unusual hour of sale or any other indicia of unfairness, courts do set sales aside. For example, in a case where the mortgaged real estate sold for 3% of the fair market value, the court set aside the sale because of the additional factor that the mortgagee had informed the mortgagor of the incorrect sale date.</p>

See, e.g., Lo v. Jensen, 106 Cal. Rptr. 2d 443 (Cal. App. 2001); Lona v. Citibank, N.A., 134 Cal. Rptr. 3d 622 (Cal. App. 2011). However, in the wake of the mortgage crisis of the first decade of the twenty-first century, about which we shall have more to say later, there have been a number of cases setting aside judgments based upon mistakes. See, e.g., Millennium Rock Mortgage, Inc. v. T.D. Service Co., 102 Cal. Rptr. 3d 544 (Cal. App. 2009) (disparity between legal description and address); CitiMortgage, Inc. v. Synuria, 86 So. 3d 1237 (Fla. App. 2012) (bank did not have agent at foreclosure sale). Also, in Lost Mountain Dev. Co. v. King, 2006 WL 3740791 (Tenn. App.), the court scrutinized a sale particularly stringently because of the deficiency judgment. What constitutes chilled bidding? For one view, see Justin Lischak Earley, Chilling the Bidding, 5 J. Marshall L.J. 99 (2011).</p>
<p id="e12db072-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Borrower’s remedies.</i></b> If the foreclosure sale is defective, what are the borrower’s remedies? Can the title of the purchaser at the sale be set aside? See Grant S. Nelson &amp; Dale A. Whitman, Real Estate Finance Law §7.22 (5th ed. 2007). The avalanche of mortgage foreclosures that began in 2007 as part of the mortgage crisis has spawned renewed interest in the subject of mortgage foreclosure and its reform. See, e.g., Aaron Byrkit, Reforming Foreclosure Disposition: A Tool for Tempering the Financial Meltdown, 63 Consumer Fin. L.Q. Rep. 275 (2009).</p>
<p id="e12db073-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Deeds in lieu of foreclosure.</i></b> Mortgage foreclosure can be an extremely costly proposition for borrowers and lenders alike. In instances where a borrower <span title="406" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-406">p. 406</span>cannot repay its debt, it can frequently avoid foreclosure by tendering its deed to the lender in lieu of foreclosure. In most instances, the lender will agree to give up any claim for a deficiency judgment. When a mortgagor cannot pay its debt and the property’s value is above the amount of the loan, he or she can always sell the property and pay off the loan. Similarly, when the debt is greater than the loan, he or she can offer a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Why would the parties ever go to the expense and trouble of foreclosure?</p>
<p id="e12db074-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. <i>Transfer by the mortgagor.</i></b> Notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary, the mortgagor can transfer his interest in the land by sale, mortgage, or otherwise. The transfer will not, however, shake off the mortgage. The land remains subject to the mortgage in the hands of the transferee.</p>
<p id="e12db075-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The purchaser of the equity may buy the mortgagor’s equity either “subject to the mortgage” or “assuming the mortgage.” If the purchaser takes subject to the mortgage, the purchaser does not assume any personal liability for the mortgage debt, for which the mortgagor remains liable. But the purchaser agrees, as between himself and the mortgagor, that the debt is to be satisfied out of the land; if the debt is not paid, the land will be sold and the debt paid from the proceeds. If the purchaser assumes the mortgage, the purchaser promises to pay off the mortgage debt. This promise does not relieve the mortgagor of the duty to pay the mortgagee, unless the lender consents to this change in the contract, but it gives the mortgagor the right to pay the debt and sue the assuming purchaser for reimbursement. The mortgagee can enforce the promise made by the purchaser of the equity in assuming the mortgage.</p>
<p id="e12db076-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the mortgagor can transfer his interest, the mortgage contract may contain an <i>acceleration clause</i> that enables the mortgagee, upon transfer of the mortgagor’s equity, to declare the whole amount of the mortgage debt due and, upon failure to pay, to foreclose. By enforcing the acceleration clause, thus requiring the new purchaser of the equity to refinance, the lender may use a <i>due-on-sale clause</i> to increase the loan interest rate to current rates upon transfer of the property.</p>

<p id="e12db079-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 2008, a mortgage crisis plunged the United States and other parts of the world into an extraordinarily deep recession. The causes of the mortgage crisis are complex, but much of it had to do with changes in the mortgage market. Go back to our hypothetical home purchasers, the Byars. Until the mid-1980s, a couple like the Byars would borrow money from a local savings and loan association (S&amp;L) to buy their house. (Think of the classic movie “It’s a Wonderful Life.”) The S&amp;L would make the loan from money in customer savings accounts, would secure the loan with a mortgage, and would hold the promissory note and the mortgage until the loan was fully repaid or otherwise terminated. So, the flow of mortgage money was geographically constrained, with some parts of the country facing shortages of funds and high interest rates.</p>
<p id="e12dd78a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This structure began to change in the 1980s when two federally-sponsored entities, the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal <span title="407" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-407">p. 407</span>Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), began creating mortgage-backed securities. This led to the creation of a secondary mortgage market. Hundreds of mortgage loans were purchased and pooled together; securities representing the pool were then issued to investors. The securities, typically guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were appealing to many investors who would otherwise have found home mortgage loans unattractive investments.</p>
<p id="e12dd78b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accompanying the emergence of a secondary mortgage market was a change in the types of mortgage loans offered to borrowers. In the past the only type of mortgage offered to borrowers was one with a fixed interest rate. In the 1980s, with interest rates going up to 16 percent and higher, lenders began to offer adjustable rate loans. The initial rate would be below the market level but would gradually increase according to an index based on debt issued by the Federal Reserve Bank.</p>
<p id="e12dd78c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The 1990s brought tremendous changes in the home loan mortgage market. The changes included growth in the secondary mortgage market, increasing detachment between origination and investment in mortgage debt, expansion of homeownership to underserved groups, and increasing automation. The old one-size-fits-all model that prevailed for so long vanished, and by 2005, risk-based lending was in full swing. No matter how risky your financial profile, you could get a mortgage loan . . . for a price, of course.</p>
<p id="e12dd78d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why did lenders make loans to borrowers who ultimately could not afford them (called the <i>subprime market</i>), and why did borrowers ultimately want these loans? Clearly, the low-interest-rate environment maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank provided many investors with an incentive to seek out vehicles that would provide higher rates of return for their money. Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) became one of these investments and were pursued by everyone from individual investors and hedge funds to pension funds and government-sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Loan originators came under great pressure to increase their volumes of loans to feed the MBS pipeline, leading to deterioration in quality and more and more subprime and Alt-A (no documentation) loans. The number of subprime mortgages originated almost doubled, from 1.1 million in 2003 to 1.9 million in 2005. Almost one-third of all mortgage debt that originated in 2005 was in the form of either subprime or Alt-A loans, three times their share of the market only two years earlier. Over three-quarters of subprime loans had short-term teaser rates that reset to much higher rates after two or three years. Median credit scores for these borrowers were almost 100 points lower than for Alt-A borrowers, who themselves had lower scores than those in the prime market. Over one-third of subprime loans and two-thirds of Alt-A loans did not require that borrowers document their income. See Christopher Mayer et al., The Rise in Mortgage Defaults, 23 J. Econ. Perspectives 27 (2009).</p>
<p id="e12dd78e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One source of debate is the extent to which federal policy itself created incentives for financial institutions to take on too much risk. A variety of federal policies and statutes promote homeownership among American households ranging from the favorable treatment of homeownership under the tax code to laws specifically incentivizing banks to lend to low and moderate income home buyers such as the Community Reinvestment Act and the statutorily mandated affordable housing goals governing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. A number of commentators have suggested that these latter regulations led banks <span title="408" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-408">p. 408</span>to make imprudent loans to buyers who should never have become home buyers. See, e.g., Peter J. Wallison, Dissent from the Majority Report of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission 2-3 (2011). Other studies have argued against these claims by arguing that while Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac certainly purchased their share of poorly underwritten loans, private, unregulated investors did the same as they pooled loans into “private label” MBS. See U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development, Report to Congress on the Root Causes of the Foreclosure Crisis 41-43 (2010).</p>
<p id="e12dd78f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the incentives of investors in mortgage credit are somewhat complicated, are the incentives of the borrowers any clearer? Why did so many individuals borrow money and purchase homes that they could not afford? There is no doubt that some buyers sought to leverage low-cost debt to make potentially lucrative investments. Some committed fraud by submitting inflated property appraisals and/or inaccurate personal financial disclosures to loan underwriters. Some expected to flip their homes within one or two years before the below-market “teaser” rates adjusted to much higher market rates. Others who wanted to live in their homes for longer periods assumed either that the meteoric rise in housing prices would go on forever or that when the game of musical chairs ended, they would safely be able to refinance their loans into more sustainable fixed-interest-rate loans. And some, of course, were uninformed and became victims. Certainly, the idea that homeownership is an essential part of the American Dream is a powerful American ideology creating a predisposition among many to want to become homeowners. When the individual desire of an unsophisticated person to become a homeowner interacts with strong market pressures by mortgage bankers and financial institutions to originate loans, the results can be combustible.</p>

Between January, 2004, and March, 2007, Fremont originated 14,578 loans to Massachusetts residents secured by mortgages on owner-occupied homes. Of the loans originated during that time period, roughly 3,000 remain active and roughly 2,500 continue to be owned or serviced by Fremont. An estimated fifty to sixty per cent of Fremont’s loans in Massachusetts were subprime.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10DC3_5eaa39f2-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10DC3_5eaa39f2-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">6</a></span> Because subprime borrowers present a greater risk to the lender, the interest rate charged for a subprime loan is typically higher than the rate charged for conventional or prime mortgages. . . .</p>

<p id="e12dd79c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Adjustable-rate-mortgage (ARM) loans are what the term suggests. They set an attractive initial rate that results in low monthly payments, but after a few (one to three) years, the rate becomes adjustable, floating up or down during the remainder of the term. In times of tight money, the rate can become quite high, resulting in monthly payments that are much higher than the initial payments. When the initial rate is reset, “ARM reset shock” often occurs.</p>
</div>
<p id="e12dd79d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fremont’s subprime loan products offered a number of different features to cater to borrowers with low income. A large majority of Fremont’s subprime loans were adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) loans, which bore a fixed interest rate for the first two or three years, and then adjusted every six months to a considerably higher variable rate for the remaining period of what was generally a thirty year loan. Thus, borrowers’ monthly mortgage payments would start out lower and then increase substantially after the introductory two-year or three-year period. To determine loan qualification, Fremont generally required that borrowers have a debt-to-income ratio of less than or equal to fifty per cent—that is, that the borrowers’ monthly debt obligations, including the applied-for mortgage, not exceed one-half their income. However, in calculating the debt-to-income ratio, Fremont considered only the monthly payment required for the introductory rate period of the mortgage loan, not the payment that would ultimately be required at the substantially higher “fully indexed” interest rate.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10DDC_5eaa39f2-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10DDC_5eaa39f2-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">7</a></span> As an additional feature to attract subprime borrowers, who typically had little or no savings, Fremont offered loans with no down payment. Instead of a down payment, Fremont would finance the full value of the property, resulting in a “loan-to-value ratio” approaching one hundred per cent. Most such financing was accomplished through the provision of a first mortgage providing eighty per cent financing and an additional “piggy-back loan” providing twenty per cent.</p>
<p id="e12dd79f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As of the time the Attorney General initiated this case in 2007, a significant number of Fremont’s loans were in default. An analysis by the Attorney General of ninety-eight of those loans indicated that all were ARM loans with a substantial increase in <span title="410" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-410">p. 410</span>payments required after the first two (or in a few cases, three) years, and that ninety per cent of the ninety-eight had a one hundred per cent loan-to-value ratio.</p>
<p id="e12dfdb0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judge granted a preliminary injunction . . . [having] determined that the Attorney General was likely to prevail on the claim that Fremont’s loans featuring a combination of the following four characteristics qualified as “unfair” under G.L. c. 93A, §2: (1) the loans were ARM loans with an introductory rate period of three years or less; (2) they featured an introductory rate for the initial period that was at least three per cent below the fully indexed rate; (3) they were made to borrowers for whom the debt-to-income ratio would have exceeded fifty per cent had Fremont measured the borrower’s debt by the monthly payments that would be due at the fully indexed rate rather than under the introductory rate; and (4) the loan-to-value ratio was one hundred per cent, or the loan featured a substantial prepayment penalty (defined by the judge as greater than the “conventional prepayment penalty” defined in G.L. c. 183C, §2) or a prepayment penalty that extended beyond the introductory rate period.</p>
<p id="e12dfdb1-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judge reasoned that Fremont as a lender should have recognized that loans with the first three characteristics just described were “doomed to foreclosure” unless the borrower could refinance the loan at or near the end of the introductory rate period, and obtain in the process a new and low introductory rate. The fourth factor, however, would make it essentially impossible for subprime borrowers to refinance unless housing prices increased, because if housing prices remained steady or declined, a borrower with a mortgage loan having a loan-to-value ratio of one hundred per cent or a substantial prepayment penalty was not likely to have the necessary equity or financial capacity to obtain a new loan. The judge stated that, “[g]iven the fluctuations in the housing market and the inherent uncertainties as to how that market will fluctuate over time . . . it is unfair for a lender to issue a home mortgage loan secured by the borrower’s principal dwelling that the lender reasonably expects will fall into default once the introductory period ends unless the fair market value of the home has increased at the close of the introductory period. To issue a home mortgage loan whose success relies on the hope that the fair market value of the home will increase during the introductory period is as unfair as issuing a home mortgage loan whose success depends on the hope that the borrower’s income will increase during that same period.”</p>
<p id="e12dfdb2-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judge concluded that the balance of harms favored granting the preliminary injunction, and that the public interest would be served by doing so. The injunction he granted requires Fremont to do the following: (1) to give advance notice to the Attorney General of its intent to foreclose on any of its home mortgage loans; and (2) as to loans that possess each of the four characteristics of unfair loans just described and that are secured by the borrower’s principal dwelling (referred to in the injunction as “presumptively unfair” loans), to work with the Attorney General to “resolve” their differences regarding foreclosure—presumably through a restructure or workout of the loan. If the loan cannot be worked out, Fremont is required to obtain approval for foreclosure from the court. The judge made clear that the injunction in no way relieved borrowers of their obligation ultimately to prove that a particular loan was unfair and foreclosure should not be permitted, or their obligation to repay the loans they had received.</p>
<p id="e12dfdb3-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">2. <i>Standard of review. . . .</i></p>
<p id="e12dfdb4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fremont’s basic contention is that, while the terms of its subprime loans may arguably seem “unfair” within the meaning of G.L. c. 93A, §2, if judged by current standards applicable to the mortgage lending industry, they did not violate any established concept of unfairness at the time they were originated; the judge, in Fremont’s view, <span title="411" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-411">p. 411</span>applied new rules or standards for defining what is “unfair” in a retroactive or ex post facto fashion—a result that is not in accord with the proper interpretation of c. 93A, §2, and also represents “bad policy,” because (among other reasons) lenders cannot know what rules govern their conduct, which will reduce their willingness to extend credit, hurting Massachusetts consumers. We do not agree that the judge applied a new standard retroactively.</p>
<p id="e12dfdb5-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fremont highlights the judge’s statement that at the time Fremont made the loans in question between 2004 and March of 2007, loans with the four characteristics the judge identified as unfair were not considered by the industry or more generally to be unfair; Fremont argues this acknowledgment by the judge is proof that the judge was creating a new definition or standard of unfairness. The argument lacks merit. First, the judge’s statement that Fremont’s combination of loan features were not recognized to be unfair does not mean the converse: that the loans were recognized to be fair. More to the point, at the core of the judge’s decision is a determination that when Fremont chose to combine in a subprime loan the four characteristics the judge identified, <i>Fremont</i> knew or should have known that they would operate in concert essentially to guarantee that the borrower would be unable to pay and default would follow unless residential real estate values continued to rise indefinitely—an assumption that, in the judge’s view, logic and experience had already shown as of January, 2004, to be unreasonable. The judge concluded that the Attorney General was likely to prove that Fremont’s actions, in originating loans with terms that in combination would lead predictably to the consequence of the borrowers’ default and foreclosure, were within established concepts of unfairness at the time the loans were made, and thus in violation of G.L. c. 93A, §2. The record supports this conclusion.</p>
<p id="e12dfdb6-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . .</p>
<p id="e12dfdb7-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The record here suggests that Fremont made no effort to determine whether borrowers could “make the scheduled payments under the terms of the loan.” Rather, as the judge determined, loans were made in the understanding that they would have to be refinanced before the end of the introductory period. Fremont suggested in oral argument that the loans were underwritten in the expectation, reasonable at the time, that housing prices would improve during the introductory loan term, and thus could be refinanced before the higher payments began. However, it was unreasonable, and unfair to the borrower, for Fremont to structure its loans on such unsupportable optimism. As a bank and mortgage lender, Fremont had been warned repeatedly before 2004 (in the context of guidance on loan safety and soundness) that it needed to consider the performance of its loans in declining markets. See, e.g., Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation, Massachusetts Division of Banks, Subprime Lending (Dec. 10, 1997) (“[M]ost subprime loans have been originated during robust economic conditions and have not been tested by a downturn in the economy. Management must ensure that the institution has adequate financial and operational strength to address these concerns effectively”). Fremont cannot now claim that it was taken by surprise by the effects of an economic decline, or that it should not be held responsible.</p>
<p id="e12dfdb8-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the conclusion that Fremont’s loans featuring the four characteristics at issue violated established concepts of unfairness is supported by the consent agreement that Fremont entered into with the FDIC on March 7, 2007, the date Fremont stopped making loans. The consent agreement contains no admission of wrongdoing by Fremont, and we do not consider it as evidence of liability on Fremont’s part. However, we view it as evidence of existing policy and guidance provided to the mortgage lending <span title="412" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-412">p. 412</span>industry. The fact that the FDIC ordered Fremont to cease and desist from the use of almost precisely the loan features that are included in the judge’s list of presumptively unfair characteristics indicates that the FDIC considered that under established mortgage lending standards, the marketing of loans with these features constituted unsafe and unsound banking practice with clearly harmful consequences for borrowers. Such unsafe and unsound conduct on the part of a lender, insofar as it leads directly to injury for consumers, qualifies as “unfair” under G.L. c. 93A, §2.</p>
<p id="e12dfdb9-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . .</p>
<p id="e12dfdba-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the Attorney General, in the name of the Commonwealth, brings this case to carry out her statutory mandate to enforce the Consumer Protection Act, it is necessary to consider whether the preliminary injunction order promotes the public interest. Commonwealth v. Mass. CRINC, 392 Mass. 79, 88-89, 466 N.E.2d 792 (1984). Fremont argues that it does not, primarily because in Fremont’s view, the order imposes new standards on lending practices that were considered permissible and acceptable when the loans were made. The result, Fremont claims, will be an unwillingness on the part of lenders to extend credit to Massachusetts consumers because they will be unwilling to risk doing business in an environment where standards are uncertain and the rules may change after the fact.</p>
<p id="e12dfdbb-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our previous discussion, and rejection, of Fremont’s claim that the judge retroactively applied new unfairness standards disposes of Fremont’s public interest argument; we do not accept the premise that, in concluding that Fremont is likely to be found to have violated established concepts of unfairness, the judge’s order has created an environment of uncertainty that lenders will shun. The injunction order crafted by the judge strikes a balance between the interests of borrowers who face foreclosure and loss of their homes under home loan mortgage terms that are at least presumptively unfair, on the one hand; and the interest of the lender in recovering the value of its loans to borrowers who received the benefit of those loaned funds and continue to have a contractual obligation to repay, on the other. The order does not bar foreclosure as a remedy for the lender, nor does it relieve borrowers of their obligations ultimately to repay the loans. Rather, it requires, where the mortgage loan terms include all four features deemed presumptively unfair, that Fremont explore alternatives to foreclosure in the first instance (a step that Fremont has indicated its desire to take in any event), and then seek approval of the court. If the court does not approve the foreclosure, that decision merely leaves the preliminary injunction in place until the Commonwealth has an opportunity to try to prove that the particular loan at issue actually violated c. 93A—a burden that is never shifted to Fremont. We conclude the order serves the public interest.</p>

<p id="e12e24d1-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Changes in the structure of the mortgage market.</i></b> Notice that in <i>Fremont</i> the loan applicants did not interact directly with bank employees. Instead, they applied through independent mortgage brokers who received fees upon the closing of the loans. Once the loan was originated, Fremont would typically sell it in the secondary mortgage market, and eventually it would be bundled into a mortgage-backed security. The process for getting a home was quite different 25 years ago; when applicants approached a savings and loan association directly, the institution made the underwriting decision and then held any loans made to maturity. How might the change in the structure of the mortgage market over the past quarter-century have contributed to the subprime crisis?</p>
<p id="e12e24d2-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>The purchasers’ motives.</i></b> Why would home purchasers seek loans that, according to the opinion in<i> Fremont</i>, were “doomed to foreclosure”? For an interesting perspective on the question, using insights from law and economics and cognitive psychology, see Oren Bar-Gill, The Law, Economics and Psychology of Subprime Mortgage Contracts, 94 Cornell L. Rev. 1073 (2009).</p>
<p id="e12e24d3-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Federal housing policy.</i></b> Since the mid-1960s, federal housing policy has increasingly tried to increase the rate of homeownership among low and moderate income households in general and among racial and ethnic minorities in particular. Among the laws enacted by Congress to promote greater access to credit are the Fair Housing Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C.A. §§3601-3619 (outlawing discrimination in housing based on race, sex, national origin, religion, color, disability, or familial status; see pages 288–289); Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, 12 U.S.C.A. §§2801-2810 (requiring regulated mortgage lenders to disclose information about applicants for home mortgage loans); Community Reinvestment Act, 12 U.S.C.A. §§2901-2907 (mandating that federally regulated financial institutions meet the credit needs of their communities); and Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, 12 U.S.C.A. §§4561-4567 (establishing affordable housing goals for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac).</p>
<p id="e12e24d4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These laws may have contributed to the growth of the subprime mortgage market over the course of the last two decades. Indeed, some borrowers were targeted by unscrupulous lenders and offered loans with extremely high interest rates and fees (points). In addition, some groups, particularly the elderly, were repeatedly induced to refinance their loans, causing them to reduce the equity in their homes and to pay pyramiding fees. These predatory practices caused many borrowers to lose their homes to foreclosure even before the housing market collapsed. See <span title="414" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-414">p. 414</span>U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development &amp; U.S. Dept. of Treasury, Curbing Predatory Home Mortgage Lending: A Joint Report (2000).</p>

After foreclosing on two properties and purchasing the properties back at the foreclosure sales, U.S. Bank National Association (U.S. Bank), as trustee for the Structured Asset Securities Corporation Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-Z; and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (Wells Fargo), as trustee for ABFC 2005-OPT 1 Trust, ABFC Asset Backed Certificates, Series 2005-OPT 1 (plaintiffs), filed separate complaints in the Land Court asking a judge to declare that they held clear title to the properties in fee simple. We agree with the judge that the plaintiffs, who were not the original mortgagees, failed to make the required showing that they were the holders of the mortgages at the time of foreclosure. As a result, they did not demonstrate that the foreclosure sales were valid to convey title to the subject properties, and their requests for a declaration of clear title were properly denied.</p>
<p id="e12e4bec-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Procedural history.</i> On July 5, 2007, U.S. Bank, as trustee, foreclosed on the mortgage of Antonio Ibanez, and purchased the Ibanez property at the foreclosure sale. On the same day, Wells Fargo, as trustee, foreclosed on the mortgage of Mark and Tammy LaRace, and purchased the LaRace property at that foreclosure sale.</p>
<p id="e12e4bed-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In September and October of 2008, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo brought separate actions in the Land Court under G.L. c. 240, §6, which authorizes actions “to quiet or establish the title to land situated in the commonwealth or to remove a cloud from the title thereto.” The two complaints sought identical relief: (1) a judgment that the right, title, and interest of the mortgagor (Ibanez or the LaRaces) in the property was extinguished by the foreclosure; (2) a declaration that there was no cloud on title arising from publication of the notice of sale in the Boston Globe; and (3) a declaration that title was vested in the plaintiff trustee in fee simple. U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo each asserted in its complaint that it had become the holder of the respective mortgage through an assignment made <i>after</i> the foreclosure sale.</p>
<p id="e12e4bee-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In both cases, the mortgagors—Ibanez and the LaRaces—did not initially answer the complaints, and the plaintiffs moved for entry of default judgment. In their motions for entry of default judgment, the plaintiffs addressed two issues: (1) whether the Boston Globe, in which the required notices of the foreclosure sales were published, is a newspaper of “general circulation” in Springfield, the town where the foreclosed properties lay. See G.L. c. 244, §14 (requiring publication every week for three weeks in newspaper published in town where foreclosed property lies, or of general circulation in that town); and (2) whether the plaintiffs were legally entitled to foreclose on the properties where the assignments of the mortgages to the plaintiffs were neither executed nor recorded in the registry of deeds until after the foreclosure sales. The two cases were heard together by the Land Court, along with a third case that raised the same issues.</p>

<p id="e12e4bef-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On March 26, 2009, judgment was entered against the plaintiffs. The judge ruled that the foreclosure sales were invalid because, in violation of G.L. c. 244, §14, the notices of the foreclosure sales named U.S. Bank (in the Ibanez foreclosure) and Wells Fargo (in the LaRace foreclosure) as the mortgage holders where they had not yet been assigned the mortgages. The judge found, based on each plaintiff’s assertions in its complaint, that the plaintiffs acquired the mortgages by assignment only after the foreclosure sales and thus had no interest in the mortgages being foreclosed at the time of the publication of the notices of sale or at the time of the foreclosure sales.</p>
<p id="e12e4bf0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiffs then moved to vacate the judgments. . . .</p>
<p id="e12e4bf1-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judge denied the plaintiffs’ motions to vacate judgment on October 14, 2009, concluding that the newly submitted documents did not alter the conclusion that the plaintiffs were not the holders of the respective mortgages at the time of foreclosure. We granted the parties’ applications for direct appellate review.</p>

<p id="e12e4bf3-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The Ibanez mortgage</i>. On December 1, 2005, Antonio Ibanez took out a $103,500 loan for the purchase of property at 20 Crosby Street in Springfield, secured by a mortgage to the lender, Rose Mortgage, Inc. (Rose Mortgage). The mortgage was recorded the following day. Several days later, Rose Mortgage executed an assignment of this mortgage in blank, that is, an assignment that did not specify the name of the assignee. The blank space in the assignment was at some point stamped with the name of Option One Mortgage Corporation (Option One) as the assignee, and that assignment was recorded on June 7, 2006. Before the recording, on January 23, 2006, Option One executed an assignment of the Ibanez mortgage in blank.</p>
<p id="e12e4bf4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to U.S. Bank, Option One assigned the Ibanez mortgage to Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB, which assigned it to Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which then assigned it to the Structured Asset Securities Corporation, which then assigned the mortgage, pooled with approximately 1,220 other mortgage loans, to U.S. Bank, as trustee for the Structured Asset Securities Corporation Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-Z. With this last assignment, the Ibanez and other loans were pooled into a trust and converted into mortgage-backed securities that can be bought and sold by investors—a process known as securitization.</p>

<p id="e12e7311-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to U.S. Bank, the assignment of the Ibanez mortgage to U.S. Bank occurred pursuant to a December 1, 2006, trust agreement, which is not in the record. What is in the record is the private placement memorandum (PPM), dated December 26, 2006, a 273-page, unsigned offer of mortgage-backed securities to potential investors. The PPM describes the mortgage pools and the entities involved, and summarizes the provisions of the trust agreement, including the representation that mortgages “will be” assigned into the trust. According to the PPM, “[e]ach transfer of a Mortgage Loan from the Seller [Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.] to the Depositor [Structured Asset Securities Corporation] and from the Depositor to the Trustee [U.S. Bank] will be intended to be a sale of that Mortgage Loan and will be reflected as such in the Sale and Assignment Agreement and the Trust Agreement, respectively.” The PPM also specifies that “[e]ach Mortgage Loan will be identified in a schedule appearing as an exhibit to the Trust Agreement.” However, U.S. Bank did not provide the judge with any mortgage schedule identifying the Ibanez loan as among the mortgages that were assigned in the trust agreement.</p>
<p id="e12e7312-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On April 17, 2007, U.S. Bank filed a complaint to foreclose on the Ibanez mortgage in the Land Court under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (Servicemembers Act), which restricts foreclosures against active duty members of the uniformed services. See 50 U.S.C. Appendix §§501, 511, 533 (2006 &amp; Supp. II 2008). In the complaint, U.S. Bank represented that it was the “owner (or assignee) and holder” of the mortgage given by Ibanez for the property. A judgment issued on behalf of U.S. Bank on June 26, 2007, declaring that the mortgagor was not entitled to protection from foreclosure under the Servicemembers Act. In June, 2007, U.S. Bank also caused to be published in the Boston Globe the notice of the foreclosure sale required by G.L. c. 244, §14. The notice identified U.S. Bank as the “present holder” of the mortgage.</p>
<p id="e12e7313-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the foreclosure sale on July 5, 2007, the Ibanez property was purchased by U.S. Bank, as trustee for the securitization trust, for $94,350, a value significantly less than the outstanding debt and the estimated market value of the property. The foreclosure deed (from U.S. Bank, trustee, as the purported holder of the mortgage, to U.S. Bank, trustee, as the purchaser) and the statutory foreclosure affidavit were recorded on May 23, 2008. On September 2, 2008, more than one year after the sale, and more than five months after recording of the sale, American Home Mortgage Servicing, Inc., “as successor-in-interest” to Option One, which was until then the record holder of the Ibanez mortgage, executed a written assignment of that mortgage to U.S. Bank, as trustee for the securitization trust. This assignment was recorded on September 11, 2008.</p>

<p id="e12e731e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Wells Fargo did not provide the judge with a copy of the flow sale and servicing agreement, so there is no document in the record reflecting an assignment of the LaRace mortgage by Option One to Bank of America. The plaintiff did produce an unexecuted copy of the mortgage loan purchase agreement, which was an exhibit to the PSA. The mortgage loan purchase agreement provides that Bank of America, as seller, “does hereby agree to and does hereby sell, assign, set over, and otherwise convey to the Purchaser [ABFC], without recourse, on the Closing Date . . . all of its right, title and interest in and to each Mortgage Loan.” The agreement makes reference to a schedule listing the assigned mortgage loans, but this schedule is not in the record, so there was no document before the judge showing that the LaRace mortgage was among the mortgage loans assigned to the ABFC.</p>
<p id="e12e731f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Wells Fargo did provide the judge with a copy of the PSA, which is an agreement between the ABFC (as depositor), Option One (as servicer), and Wells Fargo (as trustee), but this copy was downloaded from the Securities and Exchange Commission Web site and was not signed. The PSA provides that the depositor “does hereby transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey to the Trustee, on behalf of the Trust . . . all the right, title and interest of the Depositor . . . in and to . . . each Mortgage Loan identified on the Mortgage Loan Schedules,” and “does hereby deliver” to the trustee the original mortgage note, an original mortgage assignment “in form and substance acceptable for recording,” and other documents pertaining to each mortgage.</p>
<p id="e12e7320-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The copy of the PSA provided to the judge did not contain the loan schedules referenced in the agreement. Instead, Wells Fargo submitted a schedule that it represented identified the loans assigned in the PSA, which did not include property addresses, names of mortgagors, or any number that corresponds to the loan number or servicing number on the LaRace mortgage. Wells Fargo contends that a loan with the LaRace property’s zip code and city is the LaRace mortgage loan because the payment history and loan amount matches the LaRace loan.</p>
<p id="e12e7321-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On April 27, 2007, Wells Fargo filed a complaint under the Servicemembers Act in the Land Court to foreclose on the LaRace mortgage. The complaint represented Wells Fargo as the “owner (or assignee) and holder” of the mortgage given by the LaRaces for the property. A judgment issued on behalf of Wells Fargo on July 3, 2007, indicating that the LaRaces were not beneficiaries of the Servicemembers Act and that foreclosure could proceed in accordance with the terms of the power of sale. In June, 2007, Wells Fargo caused to be published in the Boston Globe the statutory notice of sale, identifying itself as the “present holder” of the mortgage.</p>
<p id="e12e7322-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the foreclosure sale on July 5, 2007, Wells Fargo, as trustee, purchased the LaRace property for $120,397.03, a value significantly below its estimated market value. Wells Fargo did not execute a statutory foreclosure affidavit or foreclosure deed until May 7, 2008. That same day, Option One, which was still the record holder of the <span title="418" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-418">p. 418</span>LaRace mortgage, executed an assignment of the mortgage to Wells Fargo as trustee; the assignment was recorded on May 12, 2008. Although executed ten months after the foreclosure sale, the assignment declared an effective date of April 18, 2007, a date that preceded the publication of the notice of sale and the foreclosure sale.</p>
<p id="e12e7323-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Discussion</i>. The plaintiffs brought actions under G.L. c. 240, §6, seeking declarations that the defendant mortgagors’ titles had been extinguished and that the plaintiffs were the fee simple owners of the foreclosed properties. . . .</p>
<p id="e12e7324-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Massachusetts does not require a mortgage holder to obtain judicial authorization to foreclose on a mortgaged property. See G.L. c. 183, §21; G.L. c. 244, §14. With the exception of the limited judicial procedure aimed at certifying that the mortgagor is not a beneficiary of the Servicemembers Act, a mortgage holder can foreclose on a property, as the plaintiffs did here, by exercise of the statutory power of sale, if such a power is granted by the mortgage itself. See Beaton v. Land Court, 367 Mass. 385, 390-391, 393, 326 N.E.2d 302, appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 806, 96 S. Ct. 16, 46 L. Ed. 2d 27 (1975).</p>
<p id="e12e7325-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where a mortgage grants a mortgage holder the power of sale, as did both the Ibanez and LaRace mortgages, it includes by reference the power of sale set out in G.L. c. 183, §21, and further regulated by G.L. c. 244, §§11-17C. Under G.L. c. 183, §21, after a mortgagor defaults in the performance of the underlying note, the mortgage holder may sell the property at a public auction and convey the property to the purchaser in fee simple, “and such sale shall forever bar the mortgagor and all persons claiming under him from all right and interest in the mortgaged premises, whether at law or in equity.” Even where there is a dispute as to whether the mortgagor was in default or whether the party claiming to be the mortgage holder is the true mortgage holder, the foreclosure goes forward unless the mortgagor files an action and obtains a court order enjoining the foreclosure. See Beaton v. Land Court, supra at 393, 326 N.E.2d 302.</p>
<p id="e12e7326-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recognizing the substantial power that the statutory scheme affords to a mortgage holder to foreclose without immediate judicial oversight, we adhere to the familiar rule that “one who sells under a power [of sale] must follow strictly its terms. If he fails to do so there is no valid execution of the power, and the sale is wholly void.” Moore v. Dick, 187 Mass. 207, 211, 72 N.E. 967 (1905). One of the terms of the power of sale that must be strictly adhered to is the restriction on who is entitled to foreclose. The “statutory power of sale” can be exercised by “the mortgagee or his executors, administrators, successors or assigns.” G.L. c. 183, §21. Under G.L. c. 244, §14, “[t]he mortgagee or person having his estate in the land mortgaged, or a person authorized by the power of sale, or the attorney duly authorized by a writing under seal, or the legal guardian or conservator of such mortgagee or person acting in the name of such mortgagee or person” is empowered to exercise the statutory power of sale. Any effort to foreclose by a party lacking “jurisdiction and authority” to carry out a foreclosure under these statutes is void. Chace v. Morse, 189 Mass. 559, 561, 76 N.E. 142 (1905). A related statutory requirement that must be strictly adhered to in a foreclosure by power of sale is the notice requirement articulated in G.L. c. 244, §14. That statute provides that “no sale under such power shall be effectual to foreclose a mortgage, unless, previous to such sale,” advance notice of the foreclosure sale has been provided to the mortgagor, to other interested parties, and by publication in a newspaper published in the town where the mortgaged land lies or of general circulation in that town. Id. “The manner in which the notice of the proposed sale shall be <span title="419" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-419">p. 419</span>given is one of the important terms of the power, and a strict compliance with it is essential to the valid exercise of the power.” Moore v. Dick, supra at 212, 72 N.E. 967. Because only a present holder of the mortgage is authorized to foreclose on the mortgaged property, and because the mortgagor is entitled to know who is foreclosing and selling the property, the failure to identify the holder of the mortgage in the notice of sale may render the notice defective and the foreclosure sale void. . . .</p>
<p id="e12e7327-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the plaintiffs to obtain the judicial declaration of clear title that they seek, they had to prove their authority to foreclose under the power of sale and show their compliance with the requirements on which this authority rests. Here, the plaintiffs were not the original mortgagees to whom the power of sale was granted; rather, they claimed the authority to foreclose as the eventual assignees of the original mortgagees. Under the plain language of G.L. c. 183, §21, and G.L. c. 244, §14, the plaintiffs had the authority to exercise the power of sale contained in the Ibanez and LaRace mortgages only if they were the assignees of the mortgages at the time of the notice of sale and the subsequent foreclosure sale. The plaintiffs claim that the securitization documents they submitted establish valid assignments that made them the holders of the Ibanez and LaRace mortgages before the notice of sale and the foreclosure sale. We turn, then, to the documentation submitted by the plaintiffs to determine whether it met the requirements of a valid assignment.</p>
<p id="e12e9a38-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Like a sale of land itself, the assignment of a mortgage is a conveyance of an interest in land that requires a writing signed by the grantor. In a “title theory state” like Massachusetts, a mortgage is a transfer of legal title in a property to secure a debt. See Faneuil Investors Group, Ltd. Partnership v. Selectmen of Dennis, 458 Mass. 1, 6, 933 N.E.2d 918 (2010). Therefore, when a person borrows money to purchase a home and gives the lender a mortgage, the homeowner-mortgagor retains only equitable title in the home; the legal title is held by the mortgagee. Where, as here, mortgage loans are pooled together in a trust and converted into mortgage-backed securities, the underlying promissory notes serve as financial instruments generating a potential income stream for investors, but the mortgages securing these notes are still legal title to someone’s home or farm and must be treated as such.</p>
<p id="e12e9a39-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Focusing first on the Ibanez mortgage, U.S. Bank argues that it was assigned the mortgage under the trust agreement described in the PPM, but it did not submit a copy of this trust agreement to the judge. The PPM, however, described the trust agreement as an agreement to be executed in the future, so it only furnished evidence of an intent to assign mortgages to U.S. Bank, not proof of their actual assignment. Even if there were an executed trust agreement with language of present assignment, U.S. Bank did not produce the schedule of loans and mortgages that was an exhibit to that agreement, so it failed to show that the Ibanez mortgage was among the mortgages to be assigned by that agreement. Finally, even if there were an executed trust agreement with the required schedule, U.S. Bank failed to furnish any evidence that the entity assigning the mortgage—Structured Asset Securities Corporation—ever held the mortgage to be assigned. The last assignment of the mortgage on record was from Rose Mortgage to Option One; nothing was submitted to the judge indicating that Option One ever assigned the mortgage to anyone before the foreclosure sale. Thus, based on the documents submitted to the judge, Option One, not U.S. Bank, was the mortgage holder at the time of the foreclosure, and U.S. Bank did not have the authority to foreclose the mortgage.</p>
<span title="420" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-420">p. 420</span>
<p id="e12e9a3a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Turning to the LaRace mortgage, Wells Fargo claims that, before it issued the foreclosure notice, it was assigned the LaRace mortgage under the PSA. The PSA, in contrast with U.S. Bank’s PPM, uses the language of a present assignment (“does hereby . . . assign” and “does hereby deliver”) rather than an intent to assign in the future. But the mortgage loan schedule Wells Fargo submitted failed to identify with adequate specificity the LaRace mortgage as one of the mortgages assigned in the PSA. Moreover, Wells Fargo provided the judge with no document that reflected that the ABFC (depositor) held the LaRace mortgage that it was purportedly assigning in the PSA. As with the Ibanez loan, the record holder of the LaRace loan was Option One, and nothing was submitted to the judge which demonstrated that the LaRace loan was ever assigned by Option One to another entity before the publication of the notice and the sale.</p>
<p id="e12e9a3b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where a plaintiff files a complaint asking for a declaration of clear title after a mortgage foreclosure, a judge is entitled to ask for proof that the foreclosing entity was the mortgage holder at the time of the notice of sale and foreclosure, or was one of the parties authorized to foreclose under G.L. c. 183, §21, and G.L. c. 244, §14. . . .</p>
<p id="e12e9a3c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not suggest that an assignment must be in recordable form at the time of the notice of sale or the subsequent foreclosure sale, although recording is likely the better practice. Where a pool of mortgages is assigned to a securitized trust, the executed agreement that assigns the pool of mortgages, with a schedule of the pooled mortgage loans that clearly and specifically identifies the mortgage at issue as among those assigned, may suffice to establish the trustee as the mortgage holder. However, there must be proof that the assignment was made by a party that itself held the mortgage. A foreclosing entity may provide a complete chain of assignments linking it to the record holder of the mortgage, or a single assignment from the record holder of the mortgage. . . . The key in either case is that the foreclosing entity must hold the mortgage at the time of the notice and sale in order accurately to identify itself as the present holder in the notice and in order to have the authority to foreclose under the power of sale (or the foreclosing entity must be one of the parties authorized to foreclose under G.L. c. 183, §21, and G.L. c. 244, §14).</p>
<p id="e12e9a3d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judge did not err in concluding that the securitization documents submitted by the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that they were the holders of the Ibanez and LaRace mortgages, respectively, at the time of the publication of the notices and the sales. The judge, therefore, did not err in rendering judgments against the plaintiffs and in denying the plaintiffs’ motions to vacate the judgments.</p>
<p id="e12e9a3e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We now turn briefly to three other arguments raised by the plaintiffs on appeal. First, the plaintiffs initially contended that the assignments in blank executed by Option One, identifying the assignor but not the assignee, not only “evidence[ ] and confirm[ ] the assignments that occurred by virtue of the securitization agreements,” but “are effective assignments in their own right.” But in their reply briefs they conceded that the assignments in blank did not constitute a lawful assignment of the mortgages. Their concession is appropriate. We have long held that a conveyance of real property, such as a mortgage, that does not name the assignee conveys nothing and is void; we do not regard an assignment of land in blank as giving legal title in land to the bearer of the assignment. . . . Second, the plaintiffs contend that, because they held the mortgage note, they had a sufficient financial interest in the mortgage to allow them to foreclose. In Massachusetts, where a note has been assigned but there is no written assignment of the mortgage underlying the note, the assignment of the note does not <span title="421" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-421">p. 421</span>carry with it the assignment of the mortgage. Barnes v. Boardman, 149 Mass. 106, 114, 21 N.E. 308 (1889). Rather, the holder of the mortgage holds the mortgage in trust for the purchaser of the note, who has an equitable right to obtain an assignment of the mortgage, which may be accomplished by filing an action in court and obtaining an equitable order of assignment. In the absence of a valid written assignment of a mortgage or a court order of assignment, the mortgage holder remains unchanged. This common-law principle was later incorporated in the statute enacted in 1912 establishing the statutory power of sale, which grants such a power to “the mortgagee or his executors, administrators, successors or assigns,” but not to a party that is the equitable beneficiary of a mortgage held by another. G.L. c. 183, §21, inserted by St. 1912, c. 502, §6.</p>
<p id="e12e9a3f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, the plaintiffs initially argued that postsale assignments were sufficient to establish their authority to foreclose, and now argue that these assignments are sufficient when taken in conjunction with the evidence of a presale assignment. . . . If the plaintiffs did not have their assignments to the Ibanez and LaRace mortgages at the time of the publication of the notices and the sales, they lacked authority to foreclose under G.L. c. 183, §21, and G.L. c. 244, §14, and their published claims to be the present holders of the mortgages were false. Nor may a postforeclosure assignment be treated as a preforeclosure assignment simply by declaring an “effective date” that precedes the notice of sale and foreclosure, as did Option One’s assignment of the LaRace mortgage to Wells Fargo. Because an assignment of a mortgage is a transfer of legal title, it becomes effective with respect to the power of sale only on the transfer; it cannot become effective before the transfer. . . .</p>
<p id="e12e9a40-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, based on the record before the judge, the plaintiffs failed to prove that they obtained valid written assignments of the Ibanez and LaRace mortgages before their foreclosures, so the postforeclosure assignments were not confirmatory of earlier valid assignments. . . .</p>
<p id="e12e9a41-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Conclusion.</i> For the reasons stated, we agree with the judge that the plaintiffs did not demonstrate that they were the holders of the Ibanez and LaRace mortgages at the time that they foreclosed these properties, and therefore failed to demonstrate that they acquired fee simple title to these properties by purchasing them at the foreclosure sale.</p>
<p id="e12e9a42-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Judgments affirmed.</p>

(concurring, with whom B<span class="epub-small-caps">OTSFORD</span>, J., joins). I concur fully in the opinion of the court, and write separately only to underscore that what is surprising about these cases is not the statement of principles articulated by the court regarding title law and the law of foreclosure in Massachusetts, but rather the utter carelessness with which the plaintiff banks documented the titles to their assets. There is no dispute that the mortgagors of the properties in question had defaulted on their obligations, and that the mortgaged properties were subject to foreclosure. Before commencing such an action, however, the holder of an assigned mortgage needs to take care to ensure that his legal paperwork is in order. Although there was no apparent actual unfairness here to the mortgagors, that is not the point. Foreclosure is a powerful act with significant consequences, and Massachusetts law has always required that it proceed strictly in accord with the statutes that govern it. As the opinion of the court notes, such strict compliance is necessary because Massachusetts both is a title theory State and allows for extrajudicial foreclosure.</p>
<span title="422" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-422">p. 422</span>
<p id="e12e9a44-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The type of sophisticated transactions leading up to the accumulation of the notes and mortgages in question in these cases and their securitization, and, ultimately the sale of mortgage-backed securities, are not barred nor even burdened by the requirements of Massachusetts law. The plaintiff banks, who brought these cases to clear the titles that they acquired at their own foreclosure sales, have simply failed to prove that the underlying assignments of the mortgages that they allege (and would have) entitled them to foreclose ever existed in any legally cognizable form before they exercised the power of sale that accompanies those assignments. The court’s opinion clearly states that such assignments do not need to be in recordable form or recorded before the foreclosure, but they do have to have been effectuated.</p>
<p id="e12ec155-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What is more complicated, and not addressed in this opinion, because the issue was not before us, is the effect of the conduct of banks such as the plaintiffs here, on a bona fide third-party purchaser who may have relied on the foreclosure title of the bank and the confirmative assignment and affidavit of foreclosure recorded by the bank subsequent to that foreclosure but prior to the purchase by the third party, especially where the party whose property was foreclosed was in fact in violation of the mortgage covenants, had notice of the foreclosure, and took no action to contest it.</p>

<p id="e12ec158-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Securitization and the increasing complexity of real estate finance.</i></b> As <i>Ibanez</i> demonstrates, we have come a long way from the days of <i>It’s a Wonderful Life</i>, in which the lender held on to mortgage loans from origination to payment. Mortgage loans today are sliced, diced, packaged, and distributed. They are also repeatedly transferred. Do you think it mattered to the court in <i>Ibanez</i> that Massachusetts was a “title” theory state, where the mortgagee is deemed to have legal title to the property? Was the fact that the mortgage foreclosure was by nonjudicial power of sale important in the case?</p>
<p id="e12ec159-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Cutting corners.</i></b> As the number of foreclosure filings shot up between 2007 and 2012, many mortgage servicers were accused of abusing the system by either cutting corners or intentionally skirting the requirements of state real property law. <i>Ibanez</i> is an example of this carelessness. Among the problems disclosed by one exhaustive federal investigation were instances of “robo-signing” (i.e., the process of lenders and their agents quickly signing affidavits and other foreclosure documents without personally verifying their accuracy), disparities in or absence of necessary documentation such as the note or assignment of the mortgage, improper imposition of fees, and, in some instances, foreclosure actions against properties whose borrowers were not delinquent. See U.S. Federal Reserve System et al., Interagency Review of Foreclosure Policies and Practices 3-4 (2011).</p>
<p id="e12ec15a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In many, but not all instances, the failures of mortgage servicers from 2008 through 2012 revolved around their failure to adhere to state legal formalities. The borrowers in the vast majority of cases were delinquent and would ultimately likely lose their properties anyway. In light of this, some members of the financial community suggested that the public outcry and ensuing litigation was a bit overblown. See, e.g., Editorial, The Politics of Foreclosure, Wall St. J., Oct. 9, 2010, at A14. Other commentators took the opposite stance. See David A. Dana, Why Mortgage “Formalities” Matter, 24 Loy. Consumer L. Rev. 505 (2012). See also <span title="423" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-423">p. 423</span>Nestor M.

<p id="e12ec15b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With respect to the issue in <i>Ibanez</i>, courts are split on the precision they require with respect to the timing of assignments. See, e.g., Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. v. Taylor, 843 N.Y.S.2d 495 (Sup. Ct. 2007) (requiring evidence of an assignment prior to the foreclosure complaint filing); US Bank N.A. v. Mallory, 982 A.2d 986 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2009) (recording the assignment is unnecessary for a valid foreclosure); U.S. Bank Natl. Assn. v. Cook, 2009 WL 35286 (N.D. Ill.) (bank employee’s testimony about inclusion of mortgage in Pooling and Servicing Agreement containing assignment language sufficed to prove timely assignment); Tina v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., 2008 WL 4790906 (S.D. Cal.) (nonjudicial foreclosure sale does not require showing the original note prior to the sale).</p>
<p id="e12ec15c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Foreclosure reform?</i></b> States have reacted to the foreclosure crisis by enacting a variety of statutory reforms. These range from temporary mortgage foreclosure moratoria to requirements that lenders and mortgage servicers contact delinquent borrowers and offer them single points of contact, housing counseling, and mortgage mediation. Perhaps the most comprehensive state mortgage foreclosure reform initiative is the California Homeowner Bill of Rights. See California Foreclosure Reduction Act, SB 900, 2011-2012 Leg. Reg. Sess. (Cal. 2012).</p>
<p id="e12ec15d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to enacting requirements that mortgage servicers provide borrowers with procedural protections, the federal Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010) (codified as amended in scattered sections of the U.S.C.), contains several provisions to rein in risky lending practices.

This section restates what is widely known as the ‘part performance doctrine.’ Part performance is not an accurate designation of such acts as taking possession and making improvements when the contract does not provide for such acts, but such acts regularly bring the doctrine into play. The doctrine is contrary to the words of the Statute of Frauds, but it was established by English courts of equity soon after the enactment of the Statute. Payment of purchase-money, without more, was once thought sufficient to justify specific enforcement, but a contrary view now prevails, since in such cases restitution is an adequate remedy. . . . Enforcement has . . . been justified on the ground that repudiation after ‘part performance’ amounts to a ‘virtual fraud.’ A more accurate statement is that courts with equitable powers are vested by tradition with what in substance is a dispensing power based on the promisee’s reliance, <i>a discretion to be exercised with caution</i> in the light of all the circumstances . . . [emphasis supplied].</p>
<p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e129df83-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f">“b. . . . Two distinct elements enter into the application of the rule of this Section: first, the extent to which the evidentiary function of the statutory formalities is fulfilled by the conduct of the parties; second, the reliance of the promisee, providing a compelling substantive basis for relief in addition to the expectations created by the promise.”</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e129df87-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN104EB_5eaa39f2-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" id="note-N104EB_5eaa39f2-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">4</a></span>&nbsp;Comment d of Restatement (Second) of Contracts, §129, reads: “d. . . . Where specific enforcement is rested on a transfer of possession plus either part payment of the price or the making of improvements, it is commonly said that the action taken by the purchaser must be unequivocally referable to the oral agreement. But this requirement is not insisted on <i>if the making of the promise is admitted or is clearly proved.</i> The promisee <i>must act in reasonable reliance on the promise, before the promisor has</i> repudiated it, and the action must be such that the remedy of restitution is inadequate. If these requirements are met, <i>neither taking of possession nor payment of money nor the making of improvements is essential . . .‘</i>’ (emphasis supplied).</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e12dd796-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10DB3_5eaa39f2-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" id="note-N10DB3_5eaa39f2-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">5</a></span>&nbsp;“Subprime” loans are loans made to borrowers who generally would not qualify for traditional loans offered at the generally prevailing rate of interest for conventional mortgages.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e12dd799-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10DC3_5eaa39f2-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" id="note-N10DC3_5eaa39f2-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">6</a></span>&nbsp;The judge made this estimate based on the fact that sixty-four per cent of all Fremont’s loans were adjustable rate mortgage loans (ARM loans), and 38.4 per cent were “stated income” loans, in which the borrower provided no documentation of his or her income. The judge inferred, based on the limited record available at the preliminary injunction stage, that all of the stated income loans were subprime ARM loans, and a majority of the remaining ARM loans were also subprime.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e12dd79e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10DDC_5eaa39f2-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" id="note-N10DDC_5eaa39f2-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">7</a></span>&nbsp;The “fully indexed” rate refers to the interest rate that represents the LIBOR rate at the time of the loan’s inception plus the rate add specified in the loan documents. The judge noted that calculation of the debt-to-income ratio based on the fully indexed rate generally yields a ratio that exceeds fifty per cent.</p></div>

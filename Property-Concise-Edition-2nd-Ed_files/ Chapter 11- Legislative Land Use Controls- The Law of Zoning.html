<p id="e1524f7b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although servitudes are one way to regulate land use, they are not the primary method of land use control in the United States today. Public, rather than private, land use control, in the form of zoning, is common throughout the United States.</p>
<div class="epub-feature epub-feature3 ">
<div class="epub-feature-heading2 cc-font-medium epub-text-left"><p id="e1524f7d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-left"><i>BACKGROUND, BRIEFLY</i></p></div>
<p id="e1524f7e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Zoning developed during the early twentieth century in response to the rapid and dramatic changes in living conditions that resulted from urbanization between 1865 and 1900. “Industrialism, the main creative force of the 19th Century,” Lewis Mumford observed in his great work, The City in History (1961), “produced the most degraded human environment the world had yet seen.” Id. at 433. The extraordinary changes it brought—congestion, overcrowding, noise, tenement housing, factories belching smoke from soft coal, and foul odors—were beyond the corrective powers of the doctrines on nuisance and servitudes considered in Chapters 9 and 10. Courts, not wishing to hinder the development that was making the United States rich, were reluctant to declare anything a nuisance except a use highly objectionable in a particular context. Any number of inuries could be visited by one neighbor upon others, yet not be legal nuisances.</p>
<p id="e1524f7f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Restrictive covenants also were incapable of dealing effectively with relations among neighbors in urban areas. They were useful only in new subdivisions and other developments of large acreage occurring under a single owner, who imposed the covenants. At the turn of the century, most development was lot by lot. Hence, early in the twentieth century, social reformers and city planners turned to zoning, which was in theory designed to <i>prevent</i> harmful neighborhood effects.</p>
<p id="e1524f80-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The roots of zoning are traceable to the City Beautiful movement of the late nineteenth century. The City Beautiful movement was animated by the idea that cities should be made to replicate the moral and civic order of the village, an order that leaders of the movement believed was virtuous and uncorrupted. The core premise of the movement was that beauty could be an effective social control device.</p>
<span title="572" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-572">p. 572</span>
<p id="e1524f81-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of the movement’s leaders, the architect Daniel Burnham, staged the Chicago World’s Fair in 1893, which through its enormous success fired up the City Beautiful movement. In 1901, the United States Congress was moved to produce, with Burnham’s guidance, a new master plan for Washington, restoring and revitalizing L’Enfant’s 1791 plan for the city. Other cities—Cleveland, Kansas City, Denver—followed with visionary city plans. The magnificent American railroad stations—Washington’s Union Station, New York’s Grand Central Terminal, and Kansas City’s cavernous Union Station—are products of the City Beautiful movement. Within 20 years, however, the City Beautiful movement ran out of steam.</p>
<p id="e1524f82-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What survived the demise of the City Beautiful movement was a certitude that rational planning was actually possible and an optimistic belief that planning bodies could control the shortsighted and uncoordinated decisions of individual landowners, which had resulted in ugly and chaotic cities. In the early twentieth century, several American cities enacted ordinances reflecting this belief. The most important of these was New York City’s 1916 zoning ordinance, the country’s first comprehensive zoning program. This ordinance assigned several classes of land uses to different zones and restricted the height and bulk of buildings.</p>
<p id="e1527593-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Zoning spread rapidly in the years after 1916, especially following the appearance of a model zoning statute in 1922, the Standard State Zoning Enabling Act. By 1925, 368 municipalities had zoning ordinances. With the spread of zoning came constitutional attacks— assertions that the new controls amounted to takings of property without compensation or worked deprivations of property without due process of law. By the mid-1920s, a few state courts had struck down zoning as unconstitutional, but others had upheld it. Everyone, especially city planners and realtors, wanted an answer from the United States Supreme Court. The answer came in the case that follows.</p>

<p id="e1527594-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1924, a federal district court found the zoning ordinance of Euclid, Ohio unconstitutional:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="e1527595-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plain truth is that the true object of the ordinance in question is to place all the property in an undeveloped area of 16 square miles in a straitjacket. The purpose to be accomplished is really to regulate the mode of living of persons who may hereafter inhabit it. In the last analysis, the result to be accomplished is to classify the population and segregate them according to their income or situation in life. The true reason why some persons live in a mansion and others in a shack, why some live in a single-family dwelling and others in a double-family dwelling, why some live in a two-family dwelling and others in an apartment, or why some live in a well-kept apartment and others in a tenement, is primarily economic. It is a matter of income and wealth, plus the labor and difficulty of procuring adequate domestic service. Aside from contributing to these results and furthering such class tendencies, the ordinance has also an esthetic purpose; that is to say, to make this village develop into a city along lines now conceived by the village council to be attractive and beautiful. . . . Whether these purposes and objects would justify the taking of plaintiff’s property as and for a public use need not be considered. It is sufficient to say that, in our opinion, and as applied to plaintiff’s property, it may not be done without compensation under the guise of exercising the police power. [Ambler Realty Co. v. Village of Euclid, 297 F. 307, 316 (N.D. Ohio 1924).]</p>

It adjoins and practically is a suburb of the City of Cleveland. Its estimated population is between 5,000 and 10,000, and its area from twelve to fourteen square miles, the greater part of which is farm lands or unimproved acreage. It lies, roughly, in the form of a parallelogram measuring approximately three and one-half miles each way. East and west it is traversed by three principal highways: Euclid Avenue, through the southerly border, St. Clair Avenue, through the central portion, and Lake Shore Boulevard, through the northerly border in close proximity to the shore of Lake Erie. The Nickel Plate railroad lies from 1,500 to 1,800 feet north of Euclid Avenue, and the Lake Shore railroad 1,600 feet farther to the north. The three highways and the two railroads are substantially parallel.</p>
<p id="e1529caf-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellee is the owner of a tract of land containing 68 acres, situated in the westerly end of the village, abutting on Euclid Avenue to the south and the Nickel Plate railroad to the north. Adjoining this tract, both on the east and on the west, there have been laid out restricted residential plats upon which residences have been erected.</p>
<p id="e1529cb0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On November 13, 1922, an ordinance was adopted by the Village Council, establishing a comprehensive zoning plan for regulating and restricting the location of trades, industries, apartment houses, two-family houses, etc., the lot area to be built upon, the size and height of buildings, etc.</p>
<p id="e1529cb1-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The entire area of the village is divided by the ordinance into six classes of use districts, denominated U-1 to U-6, inclusive; three classes of height districts, denominated H-1 to H-3, inclusive; and four classes of area districts, denominated A-1 to A-4, inclusive. The use districts are classified in respect of the buildings which may be erected within their respective limits, as follows: U-1 is restricted to single family dwellings . . . ; U-2 is extended to include two-family dwellings; U-3 is further extended to include apartment houses, hotels, churches, schools, public libraries . . . ; U-4 is further extended to include banks, offices, studios, telephone exchanges, fire and police stations . . . ; U-5 is further extended to include [light industry]; U-6 is further extended to include . . . manufacturing and industrial operations of any kind other than, and any public utility not included in, a class U-1, U-2, U-3, U-4 or U-5 use. . . . Class U-1 is the only district in which buildings are restricted to those enumerated. In the other classes the uses are cumulative; that is to say, uses in class U-2 include those enumerated in the preceding class, U-1; class U-3 includes uses enumerated in the preceding classes, U-2 and U-1; and so on. . . . Appellee’s tract of land comes under U-2, U-3, and U-6. The first strip of 620 feet immediately north of Euclid Avenue falls in class U-2, the next 130 feet to the north, in U-3, and the remainder in U-6. The uses of the first 620 feet, therefore, do not <span title="574" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-574">p. 574</span>include apartment houses, hotels, churches, schools, or other public and semi-public buildings, or other uses enumerated in respect to U-3 to U-6, inclusive. The uses of the next 130 feet include all of these, but exclude industries, theatres, banks, shops, and the various other uses set forth in respect of U-4 to U-6, inclusive.</p>
<p id="e1529cb2-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Annexed to the ordinance, and made a part of it, is a zone map, showing the location and limits of the various use, height and area districts, from which it appears that the three classes overlap one another; that is to say, for example, both U-5 and U-6 use districts are in A-4 area districts, but the former is in H-2 and the latter in H-3 height districts. . . . </p>
<p id="e1529cb3-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The lands lying between the two railroads for the entire length of the village area and extending some distance on either side to the north and south, having an average width of about 1,600 feet, are left open, with slight exceptions, for industrial and all other uses. This includes the larger part of appellee’s tract. . . . </p>
<p id="e1529cb4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The enforcement of the ordinance is entrusted to the inspector of buildings, under rules and regulations of the board of zoning appeals. Meetings of the board are public, and minutes of its proceedings are kept. It is authorized to adopt rules and regulations to carry into effect provisions of the ordinance. Decisions of the inspector of buildings may be appealed to the board by any person claiming to be adversely affected by any such decision. The board is given power in specific cases of practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship to interpret the ordinance in harmony with its general purpose and intent, so that the public health, safety and general welfare may be secure and substantial justice done. Penalties are prescribed for violations . . . The ordinance is assailed on the grounds that it is in derogation of §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution in that it deprives appellee of liberty and property without due process of law and denies it the equal protection of the law, and that it offends against certain provisions of the Constitution of the State of Ohio. The prayer of the bill is for an injunction restraining the enforcement of the ordinance and all attempts to impose or maintain as to appellee’s property any of the restrictions, limitations or conditions. The court below held the ordinance to be unconstitutional and void, and enjoined its enforcement. 297 Fed. 307.</p>
<p id="e1529cb5-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before proceeding to a consideration of the case, it is necessary to determine the scope of the inquiry. The bill alleges that the tract of land in question is vacant and has been held for years for the purpose of selling and developing it for industrial uses, for which it is especially adapted, being immediately in the path of progressive industrial development; that for such uses it has a market value of about $10,000 per acre, but if the use be limited to residential purpose the market value is not in excess of $2,500 per acre; that the first 200 feet of the parcel back from Euclid Avenue, if unrestricted in respect of use, has a value of $150 per front foot, but if limited to residential uses, and ordinary mercantile business be excluded therefrom, its value is not in excess of $50 per front foot.</p>
<p id="e1529cb6-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is specifically averred that the ordinance attempts to restrict and control the lawful uses of appellee’s land so as to confiscate and destroy a great part of its value; . . . that the ordinance constitutes a cloud upon the land, reduces and destroys its value, and has the effect of diverting the normal industrial, commercial and residential development thereof to other and less favorable locations.</p>
<p id="e1529cb7-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The record goes no farther than to show, as the lower court found, that the normal, and reasonably to be expected, use and development of that part of appellee’s land adjoining Euclid Avenue is for general trade and commercial purposes, particularly retail stores and like establishments, and that the normal, and reasonably to be expected, use and development of the residue of the land is for industrial and trade purposes. Whatever injury is inflicted by the mere existence and threatened enforcement of the ordinance is due to restrictions in respect of these and similar uses; to which perhaps should be added—if not included in the foregoing—restrictions in respect of apartment houses. . . .</p>

<p id="e152c3d4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Building zone laws are of modern origin. They began in this country about twenty-five years ago. Until recent years, urban life was comparatively simple; but with the great increase and concentration of population, problems have developed, and constantly are developing, which require, and will continue to require, additional restrictions in respect of the use and occupation of private lands in urban communities. Regulations, the wisdom, necessity and validity of which, as applied to existing conditions, are so apparent that they are now uniformly sustained, a century ago, or even half a century ago, probably would have been rejected as arbitrary and oppressive. Such regulations are sustained, under the complex conditions of our day, for reasons analogous to those which justify traffic regulations, which, before the advent of automobiles and rapid transit street railways, would have been condemned as fatally arbitrary and unreasonable. And in this there is no inconsistency, for while the meaning of constitutional guaranties never varies, the scope of their application must expand or contract to meet the new and different conditions which are constantly coming within the field of their operation. In a changing world, it is impossible that it should be otherwise. . . . The ordinance now under review, and all similar laws and regulations, must find their justification in some aspect of the police power, asserted for the public welfare. The line which in this field separates the legitimate from the illegitimate assumption of power is not capable of precise delimitation. It varies with circumstances and conditions. A regulatory zoning ordinance, which would be clearly valid as applied <span title="576" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-576">p. 576</span>to the great cities, might be clearly invalid as applied to rural communities. In solving doubts, the maxim <i>sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas</i>, which lies at the foundation of so much of the common law of nuisances, ordinarily will furnish a fairly helpful clew. And the law of nuisances, likewise, may be consulted, not for the purpose of controlling, but for the helpful aid of its analogies in the process of ascertaining the scope of, the power. Thus the question whether the power exists to forbid the erection of a building of a particular kind or for a particular use, like the question whether a particular thing is a nuisance, is to be determined, not by an abstract consideration of the building or of the thing considered apart, but by considering it in connection with the circumstances and the locality. . . . A nuisance may be merely a right thing in the wrong place—like a pig in the parlor instead of the barnyard. If the validity of the legislative classification for zoning purposes be fairly debatable, the legislative judgment must be allowed to control. . . . </p>
<p id="e152eae5-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no serious difference of opinion in respect of the validity of laws and regulations fixing the height of buildings within reasonable limits, the character of materials and methods of construction, and the adjoining area which must be left open, in order to minimize the danger of fire or collapse, the evils of over-crowding, and the like, and excluding from residential sections offensive trades, industries and structures likely to create nuisances. . . . </p>
<p id="e152eae6-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, however, the exclusion is in general terms of all industrial establishments, and it may thereby happen that not only offensive or dangerous industries will be excluded, but those which are neither offensive nor dangerous will share the same fate. But this is no more than happens in respect of many practice-forbidding laws which this Court has upheld although drawn in general terms so as to include individual cases that may turn out to be innocuous in themselves. . . . The inclusion of a reasonable margin to insure effective enforcement, will not put upon a law, otherwise valid, the stamp of invalidity. Such laws may also find their justification in the fact that, in some fields, the bad fades into the good by such insensible degrees that the two are not capable of being readily distinguished and separated in terms of legislation. In the light of these considerations, we are not prepared to say that the end in view was not sufficient to justify the general rule of the ordinance, although some industries of an innocent character might fall within the proscribed class. It cannot be said that the ordinance in this respect “passes the bounds of reason and assumes the character of a merely arbitrary fiat.” Purity Extract Co. v. Lynch, 226 U.S. 192, 204. Moreover, the restrictive provisions of the ordinance in this particular may be sustained upon the principles applicable to the broader exclusion from residential districts of all business and trade structures, presently to be discussed. We find no difficulty in sustaining restrictions of the kind thus far reviewed. The serious question in the case arises over the provisions of the ordinance excluding from residential districts, apartment houses, business houses, retail stores and shops, and other like establishments. This question involves the validity of what is really the crux of the more recent zoning legislation, namely, the creation and maintenance of residential districts, from which business and trade of every sort, including hotels and apartment houses, are excluded. Upon that question this Court has not thus far spoken. The decisions of the state courts are numerous and conflicting; but those which broadly sustain the power greatly outnumber those which deny altogether or narrowly limit it; and it is very apparent that there is a constantly increasing tendency in the direction of the broader view. . . . </p>
<span title="577" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-577">p. 577</span>
<p id="e152eae7-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The matter of zoning has received much attention at the hands of commissions and experts, and the results of their investigations have been set forth in comprehensive reports. These reports, which bear every evidence of painstaking consideration, concur in the view that the segregation of residential, business, and industrial buildings will make it easier to provide fire apparatus suitable for the character and intensity of the development in each section; that it will increase the safety and security of home life; greatly tend to prevent street accidents, especially to children, by reducing the traffic and resulting confusion in residential sections; decrease noise and other conditions which produce or intensify nervous disorders; preserve a more favorable environment in which to rear children, etc. With particular reference to apartment houses, it is pointed out that the development of detached house sections is greatly retarded by the coming of apartment houses, which has sometimes resulted in destroying the entire section for private house purposes; that in such sections very often the apartment house is a mere parasite, constructed in order to take advantage of the open spaces and attractive surroundings created by the residential character of the district. Moreover, the coming of one apartment house is followed by others, interfering by their height and bulk with the free circulation of air and monopolizing the rays of the sun which otherwise would fall upon the smaller homes, and bringing, as their necessary accompaniments, the disturbing noises incident to increased traffic and business, and the occupation, by means of moving and parked automobiles, of larger portions of the streets, thus detracting from their safety and depriving children of the privilege of quiet and open spaces for play, enjoyed by those in more favored localities—until, finally, the residential character of the neighborhood and its desirability as a place of detached residences are utterly destroyed. Under these circumstances, apartment houses, which in a different environment would be not only entirely unobjectionable but highly desirable, come very near to being nuisances.</p>
<p id="e152eae8-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If these reasons, thus summarized, do not demonstrate the wisdom or sound policy in all respects of those restrictions which we have indicated as pertinent to the inquiry, at least, the reasons are sufficiently cogent to preclude us from saying, as it must be said before the ordinance can be declared unconstitutional, that such provisions are clearly arbitrary and unreasonable, having no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. . . .

They thought it a favorable case for a broad holding for several reasons. First, it took three-quarters of the value out of part of the plaintiff’s land. Second, the court might see tiny Euclid as interfering with the natural and desirable expansion of Cleveland. Third, the ordinance had six use districts, three height districts, and four area districts, making it difficult to justify as nuisance prevention.</p>

<p id="e1542372-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Euclidean zoning.</i></b> The zoning scheme of the Euclid ordinance is known today as <i>Euclidean zoning</i>. Districts are graded from “highest” (single-family residences) to “lowest” (the worst kind of industry). Under Euclidean zoning, the uses permitted in each district are cumulative; higher uses are permitted in areas zoned for lower uses but not vice versa. Thus one can put a single-family house in an apartment district, and both uses in a commercial district, but not a commercial use in a residential district nor an apartment house in a single-family district. In an attempt to preserve large tracts for future industrial use, improving the fiscal base, some cities have turned to noncumulative zoning, prohibiting houses and commerce in industrial zones (often called <i>industrial parks</i>).</p>
<p id="e1542373-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The terms “higher” and “lower” uses do not refer to economic value. <i>A</i>, whose lot is zoned residential, has a higher use than <i>B</i>, whose lot is zoned commercial, but <i>A</i>’s lot ordinarily has a lower value. Commercially zoned property usually sells at a higher price than residentially zoned property.</p>
<p id="e1544a84-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>“As applied” constitutional challenges.</i></b> Notice that the plaintiff in <i>Euclid</i> did not challenge any specific provisions of the ordinance in question, but rather attacked the zoning law in its entirety. The Supreme Court in turn held zoning <i>in general</i> to be constitutional but added that concrete applications of specific provisions could prove to be arbitrary and unreasonable; such problems would be dealt with as they arose. Two years later, in Nectow v. City of Cambridge, 277 U.S. 183 (1928), the Court followed through on this warning by deciding that the zoning ordinance, as applied to the plaintiff’s land, was arbitrary and unreasonable. After <i>Nectow</i>, the Supreme Court went out of the zoning business for nearly half a century, leaving the policing of zoning laws to state courts. In recent years, however, the Court has become active in the area once again. We shall have occasion to consider some of its opinions in the balance of this chapter and in the next.</p>
<p id="e1544a85-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Zoning U.S.A.</i></b> “Today, zoning is virtually universal in the metropolitan areas of the United States. . . . Of cities with over 250,000 population only Houston, Texas, has not enacted a zoning ordinance.” Robert C. Ellickson, Alternatives to Zoning: Covenants, Nuisance Rules, and Fines as Land Use Controls, 40 U. Chi. L. Rev. 681, 692 (1973). And Houston is an exception in only the strictest sense; “extensive government regulation belies the city’s free market reputation in land use management. . . . [G]overnment policies have altered land use decisions for decades, and recent interventions continue the trend toward greater regulation.” Teddy M. Kapur, Land Use Regulation in Houston Contradicts the City’s Free Market Reputation, 34 Envtl. L. Rep. 10045 (2004). Moreover, Houston has in recent years turned increasingly to nuisance law to regulate undesirable land uses.

Chron., Apr. 10, 2009; Houston Using Nuisance Laws on Business, Hous. Chron., Apr. 11, 2009. A recent study by two economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas suggests that the absence of zoning laws has kept land values in Houston stable, reducing volatility in housing prices.

<p id="e1544a88-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Zoning is an exercise of the police power—essentially, the power of government to protect health, safety, welfare, and morals. Generally speaking, the police power is held to reside in the state, but in the case of zoning, all states have adopted enabling acts that delegate zoning authority to local governments.</p>
<p id="e1544a89-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Standard State Zoning Enabling Act is fairly representative of zoning ordinances. It empowers municipalities to “regulate and restrict the height, number of stories, and size of buildings and other structures, the percentage of lot that may be occupied, the size of yards, courts, and other open spaces, the density of population, and the location and use of buildings, structures, and land for trade, industry, residence, or other purposes.” It permits the division of municipalities into districts (zones) of appropriate number, shape, and area, and provides that regulations may vary from district to district. The regulations must be made in accordance with a comprehensive plan. Under the Standard Act, to enact a zoning ordinance a city must create a planning (or zoning) commission and a board of adjustment (sometimes called a board of zoning appeals). The commission and the board are composed of citizens appointed by the mayor. The commission, advised by planning experts, has the function of recommending a comprehensive plan and a zoning ordinance to the city council. The zoning ordinance must be enacted by the city council.</p>
<p id="e1544a8a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The board of adjustment plays a different role. It may grant a variance when the zoning restrictions cause the owner practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship. It also may grant a special exception when specific requirements set forth in the zoning ordinance are met.</p>
<p id="e1544a8b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The comprehensive plan is a statement of the local government’s objectives and standards for development. Usually made up of maps, charts, and descriptive text, it shows the boundaries of height, area, bulk, and use zones, and the locations of streets, bridges, parks, public buildings, and the like. The plan is based on surveys and studies of the city’s present situation and future needs, the idea being to anticipate change and promote harmonious development. Only about half of the states require comprehensive plans. As to those with plan requirements, judicial attitudes vary greatly. Some hold, absent very specific language in the enabling legislation, that the plan need not be written down in a document separate from the zoning ordinance itself; some consider that the statement of purpose in the zoning ordinance’s preamble is evidence of an underlying plan to which the ordinance conforms; some have found the scheme of regulations in the ordinance to be “the plan.” Even when a written plan exists, zoning regulations inconsistent with it are not necessarily invalid, so long as they are considered reasonable and in the public interest.</p>

This appeal presents an issue of first impression to this Court, i.e., whether a zoning ordinance which requires the amortization and discontinuance of a lawful preexisting nonconforming use is confiscatory and violative of the constitution as a taking of property without just compensation.</p>
<p id="e15471a4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On May 4, 1985, after obtaining the necessary permits and certificates to conduct its business on leased premises, appellant, PA Northwestern Distributors, Inc., opened an adult book store in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. Four days later, the Moon Township Board of Supervisors published a public notice of its intention to amend the Moon Township Zoning Ordinance to regulate “adult commercial enterprises.” On May 23, 1985, following a public hearing on the matter, the Moon Township Board of Supervisors adopted Ordinance No. 243, effective on May 28, 1985, which ordinance imposes extensive restrictions on the location and operation of “adult commercial enterprises.” Section 805 of the ordinance provides as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="e15471a5-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Amortization</i>. Any commercial enterprise which would constitute a pre-existing use and which would be in conflict with the requirements set forth in this amendment to the Moon Township Zoning Ordinance has 90 days from the date that the ordinance becomes effective to come into compliance with this ordinance. This 90-day grace period is designed to be a period of amortization for those pre-existing businesses which cannot meet the standards set forth in this amendment to the Moon Township Zoning Ordinance.</p>
</div>
<p id="e15471a6-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant’s adult book store, by definition, is an adult commercial enterprise under the ordinance, and it does not and cannot meet the place restrictions set forth in the ordinance in that it is not located within an area designated for adult commercial enterprises.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN101EC_5eaa6107-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N101EC_5eaa6107-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">1</a></span> The Zoning Officer of Moon Township notified appellant that it was out of compliance with the ordinance. Appellant filed an appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board of the Township of Moon, appellee herein. The appeal was limited to challenging the validity of the amortization provision set forth in the ordinance.</p>
<p id="e15471a8-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Following a hearing, the Zoning Hearing Board upheld the validity of the amortization provision as applied, and appellant filed an appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County. No further evidence was taken, and appellant’s appeal was dismissed. On appeal, Commonwealth Court affirmed, 124 Pa. Commw. 228, 555 A.2d 1368, basing its decision on Sullivan v. Zoning Board of Adjustment, 83 Pa. <span title="581" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-581">p. 581</span>Commw. 228, 478 A.2d 912 (1984).

<p id="e15471a9-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the case of <i>Sullivan</i>, supra, the Commonwealth Court determined that provisions for the amortization of nonconforming uses are constitutional exercises of the police power so long as they are reasonable. It was the opinion of the Commonwealth Court in that case, that the “distinction between an ordinance restricting future uses and one requiring the termination of present uses within a reasonable period of time is merely one of degree. . . .” 83 Pa. Commw. at 244, 478 A.2d at 920. To determine whether the amortization provisions are reasonable, the Commonwealth Court stated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="e15471aa-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Each case in this class must be determined on its own facts; and the answer to the question of whether the provision is reasonable must be decided by observing its impact upon the property under consideration. The true issue is that of whether, considering the nature of the present use, the length of the period for amortization, the present characteristics of and the foreseeable future prospects for development of the vicinage and other relevant facts and circumstances, the beneficial effects upon the community that would result from the discontinuance of the use can be seen to more than offset the losses to the affected landowner. [83 Pa. Commw. at 247, 478 A.2d at 920.]</p>
</div>
<p id="e15471ab-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Following this standard, the Zoning Hearing Board herein heard evidence regarding the impact upon the property in question with respect to the nature of the present use, the period for amortization, the characteristics of the vicinage, etc., and determined that the amortization provision was reasonable as applied. In this regard the Zoning Hearing Board stated that the “real and substantial benefits to the Township of elimination of the nonconforming use from this location . . . more than offset the losses to the affected landowner.” Opinion of the Board at 13 (May 20, 1987).</p>
<p id="e15471ac-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the Commonwealth Court opinion in <i>Sullivan</i>, supra, had been a correct statement of the law in this Commonwealth, we would be constrained to find that appellee herein had not committed an error of law or an abuse of discretion. For the following reasons, however, we find that <i>Sullivan</i> is not a correct statement of the law regarding amortization provisions in this Commonwealth.</p>
<p id="e15471ad-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this Commonwealth, all property is held in subordination to the right of its reasonable regulation by the government, which regulation is clearly necessary to preserve the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the people. Moreover, “a presumption of validity attaches to a zoning ordinance which imposes the burden to prove its invalidity upon the one who challenges it.” National Land and Investment Co. v. Easttown Township Board of Adjustment, 419 Pa. 504, 522, 215 A.2d 597, 607 (1965). This Court has noted, however, that the presumption of a zoning ordinance’s validity must be tempered by the Court’s appreciation of the fact that zoning involves governmental restrictions upon a property owner’s <i>constitutionally guaranteed</i> right to use his or her property, unfettered by governmental restrictions, except where the use violates any law, the use creates a nuisance, or the owner violates any covenant, restriction or easement.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1021B_5eaa6107-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1021B_5eaa6107-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">2</a></span></p>
<span title="582" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-582">p. 582</span>
<p id="e15471af-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many other jurisdictions have upheld the validity of amortization provisions in zoning ordinances, finding that it is appropriate to balance the property interests of the individual with the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the community at large, and that, where reasonable, amortization provisions succeed in effectuating orderly land use planning and development in a way that the natural attrition of nonconforming uses cannot. See cases collected at Annotation, Validity of Provisions for Amortization of Nonconforming Uses, 22 A.L.R.3d (1968 &amp; Supp. 1990).</p>
<p id="e15471b0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although this Court has never before considered the validity of an amortization provision in a zoning ordinance, it has long been the law of this Commonwealth that municipalities lack the power to compel a change in the nature of an existing lawful use of property. . . . In addition, municipalities may not prevent the owner of nonconforming property from making those necessary additions to an existing structure as are needed to provide for its natural expansion, so long as such additions would not be detrimental to the public welfare, safety, and health.</p>
<p id="e15471b1-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A lawful nonconforming use establishes in the property owner a vested property right which cannot be abrogated or destroyed, unless it is a nuisance, it is abandoned, or it is extinguished by eminent domain. . . . </p>
<p id="e15471b2-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The effect of the amortization provision herein is to deprive appellant of the lawful use of its property in that the ordinance forces appellant to cease using its property as an adult book store within 90 days. Appellee argues that appellant is free to relocate to one of the few sites in the Township of Moon that complies with the place restrictions of the ordinance, or to change its use to sell some other commodity, in an attempt to convince this Court that the ordinance has not effectuated a “taking” of appellant’s property without just compensation. The Pennsylvania Constitution, Pa. Const. art. I, §1, however, protects the right of a property owner to use his or her property in any lawful way that he or she so chooses. If government desires to interfere with the owner’s use, where the use is lawful and is not a nuisance nor is it abandoned, it must compensate the owner for the resulting loss. A gradual phasing out of nonconforming uses which occurs when an ordinance only restricts future uses differs in significant measure from an amortization provision which restricts future uses <i>and</i> extinguishes a lawful nonconforming use on a timetable which is not of the property owner’s choosing.</p>
<p id="e15498c3-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The language of the Missouri Supreme Court in Hoffman v. Kinealy, 389 S.W.2d 745, 753 (Mo. 1965), is apropos to the issue of this case:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="e15498c4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[I]t would be a strange and novel doctrine indeed which would approve a municipality taking private property for public use without compensation if the property was not too valuable and the taking was not too soon, and prompts us to repeat the caveat of Mr. Justice Holmes in Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393, 416, 43 S. Ct. 158, 160, 67 L. Ed. 322, 326, 28 A.L.R. 1321, that “[we] are in danger of forgetting that a strong public desire to improve the public condition is not enough to warrant achieving the desire by a shorter cut than the constitutional way of paying for the change.” . . . </p>
</div>
<p id="e15498c5-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, we hold that the amortization and discontinuance of a lawful pre-existing nonconforming use is per se confiscatory and violative of the Pennsylvania Constitution, Pa.

<p id="e15498c6-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is clear that if we were to permit the amortization of nonconforming uses in this Commonwealth, <i>any</i> use could be amortized out of existence without just compensation. Although such a zoning option seems reasonable when the use involves some activity that may be distasteful to some members of the public, <i>no</i> use would be exempt from the reach of amortization, and <i>any</i> property owner could lose the use of his or her property without compensation. Even a homeowner could find one day that his or her “castle” had become a nonconforming use and would be required to vacate the premises within some arbitrary period of time, <i>without just compensation</i>. Such a result is repugnant to a basic protection accorded in this Commonwealth to vested property interests.</p>
<p id="e15498c7-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, we find that the amortization provision, Section 805, of Ordinance No. 243 of the Township of Moon is unconstitutional on its face, and we reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court, which affirmed the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County dismissing appellant’s appeal from the decision of the Zoning Hearing Board of the Township of Moon.</p>

While I agree with the result reached by the majority, that Section 805 of Ordinance No. 243 is invalid in this case, I must disagree with the finding that any provision for the amortization of nonconforming uses would be per se confiscatory and unconstitutional. I would uphold the Commonwealth Court’s decision relying on Sullivan v. Zoning Board of Adjustment, 83 Pa. Commw. 228, 478 A.2d 912 (1984), and hold that a reasonable amortization provision is valid if it reflects the consideration of certain factors. The instant provision, however, falls short of the reasonableness requirements and therefore must be struck down.</p>
<p id="e15498c9-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The weight of authority supports the conclusion that a reasonable amortization provision would not be unconstitutional. See generally 22 A.L.R.3d 1134 (1968). It has been stated that a blanket rule against amortization provisions should be rejected because such a rule has a debilitating effect on effective zoning, unnecessarily restricts a state’s police power, and prevents the operation of a reasonable and flexible method of eliminating nonconforming uses in the public interest. Lachapelle v. Goffstown, 107 N.H. 485, 225 A.2d 624 (1967). The New Hampshire court found acceptable amortization provisions which were reasonable as to time and directed toward some reasonable aspect of land use regulation under properly delegated police power. Id. Other cases have considered several factors in determining the reasonableness of these provisions. Those factors weigh any circumstance bearing upon a balancing of public gain against private loss, including the length of the amortization period in relation to the nature of the nonconforming use; length of time in relation to the investment; and the degree of offensiveness of the nonconforming use in view of the character of the surrounding neighborhood. . . . </p>
<p id="e15498ca-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I believe that a per se prohibition against amortization provisions is too restrictive. A community should have a right to change its character without being locked into pre-existing definitions of what is offensive. As this Court has also noted, “nonconforming uses, inconsistent with a basic purpose of zoning, represent conditions which should be reduced to conformity as speedily as is compatible with the law and the Constitution.” Hanna v. Board of Adjustment of Borough of Forest Hills, 408 Pa. 306, 312-13, 183 A.2d 539, 543 (1962). I believe that amortization provisions are an effective method of reconciling interests of the community with those of property owners. Where the provisions are reasonable in consideration of the elements herein discussed, <span title="584" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-584">p. 584</span>they provide adequate notice to the property owner so that no deprivation of property or use thereof is suffered, yet they simultaneously afford a township the opportunity to alter the character of its neighborhoods when the alteration takes the form of a reasonable land use regulation.</p>
<p id="e15498cb-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, however, the amortization provision is not a reasonable one because it fails to provide adequate time for elimination of the nonconforming use. The period allowed for the dissolution of appellant’s business is ninety days. Certainly ninety days is an insufficient period of time to allow a merchant to close a business. Any contractual obligations appellant has incurred in anticipation of operating the business probably cannot be terminated within such a short period of time without severe hardship on appellant’s part. Three months also would not permit appellant to obtain an alternative means of income. Moreover, forcing appellant to liquidate his enterprise within ninety days could prevent him from obtaining a reasonable return on his investment. I therefore agree that the instant provision is confiscatory.</p>

Consider this problem. <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> each have $50,000 to invest. <i>A</i> purchases a vacant lot for $50,000. Ten years later the city passes a zoning ordinance zoning <i>A</i>’s land for single-family dwellings. The value of <i>A</i>’s land is reduced to $12,500 by this action. As we shall see in Chapter 12, it is likely that <i>A</i> has no grounds to sue the city for this loss of value.</p>
<p id="e15498cf-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>B</i> purchases a vacant lot next to <i>A</i>’s lot for $10,000 and builds and equips a store on the premises for $40,000, for a total investment of $50,000. The store earns <i>B</i> a 10 percent net profit each year after paying all business expenses, including <i>B</i>’s salary. After 10 years the city passes a zoning ordinance zoning <i>B</i>’s land for single-family dwellings. The value of <i>B</i>’s land, like <i>A</i>’s land, is reduced by three-fourths. If this ordinance requires <i>B</i> to discontinue his nonconforming use immediately, the courts almost surely would declare it unconstitutional as a taking of <i>B</i>’s property. Why should this be so? Is <i>B</i> harmed more than <i>A</i>? If the ordinance were retroactive, would you prefer to be in <i>A</i>’s shoes or <i>B</i>’s? See generally Christopher Serkin, Existing Uses and the Limits of Land Use Regulations, 84 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1222 (2009).</p>
<p id="e154bfe0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Amortization</i><i>.</i></b> Would a longer period have mattered in the <i>PA Northwestern</i> case? Should it have? The court in the <i>Sullivan</i> case (quoted on page 581) reasoned that “the distinction between an ordinance restricting future uses and one requiring the termination of present uses within a reasonable period of time is merely one of degree.” Is this correct? Does protection of the landowner’s investment-backed expectations in continuing the existing use raise claims of fairness not present where new uses are prohibited? The same general issue is involved in whether persons should be “grandfathered” from legislation and whether overruling of cases by courts should be retroactive or only prospective.</p>
<p id="e154bfe1-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Vested rights.</i></b> Related to the law of nonconforming uses is the more general doctrine of vested rights. In the case of nonconforming uses, a preexisting operation is protected; plans to engage in some particular use are insufficient. In the case of vested rights doctrine, a proposed use might be protected if sufficient <span title="585" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-585">p. 585</span>commitments have been made—plans drawn, permits obtained, the site prepared, construction begun—in reliance on existing zoning requirements that are subsequently changed in a way that invalidates the proposed use. Vested rights doctrine varies in practice from jurisdiction to jurisdiction (some of which have statutes or ordinances on the question), but the critical variables include how far the developer has gone in obtaining governmental approvals, how much money has been invested in good faith, and on what the money has been spent. See generally American Law of Zoning, supra, §§12:20-12:34.</p>

<p id="e154bfe4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By segregating various classes of uses in tightly drawn districts, Euclidean zoning can work inequitable hardships and promote inefficient patterns of land use. Zoning laws can also inhibit socially and aesthetically desirable diversity. See Jane Jacobs, The Death and Life of Great American Cities 152-177, 222-269 passim (1961). On a number of grounds, then, there is a need to provide flexibility in zoning. The approach to nonconforming uses, considered in the last section, could be regarded as one way of doing so; this section surveys a number of others. They range from modest techniques to modify traditional zoning regulations, to distinctly non-Euclidean approaches, to public control of land use.</p>

<p id="e154bfec-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Commons v. Westwood Zoning Board of Adjustment, 410 A.2d 1138 (N.J. 1980).</b> As is typical, New Jersey’s enabling statute delegates to boards of adjustment the power to grant a variance, provided two conditions are met. First, the variance must be necessary to avoid imposing <i>undue hardship</i> on the owner of the <span title="586" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-586">p. 586</span>land in question. (Undue hardship “involves the underlying notion that no effective use can be made of the property in the event the variance is denied.”) To show hardship, the owner must first have made reasonable efforts to comply with the zoning ordinance—say by trying, in the case of an undersized lot, to sell it to, or buy additional land from, a neighbor, in either case at a fair price. And the owner’s hardship must not have been self-inflicted, such as by earlier disposing of part of his land with the result that what was left fell short of area requirements. Second, “the grant of the variance must not substantially impinge upon the public good and the intent and purpose of the zoning plan and ordinance.” This requires paying attention to “the manner in and extent to which the variance will impact upon the character of the area.”</p>
<p id="e154e6fd-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Weingarten wanted to build a one-family residence on the only undeveloped lot in a residential neighborhood. Because his lot did not meet the existing zoning ordinance’s minimum lot size requirements (it had a frontage of 30 feet and a total area of 5,190 square feet, whereas the zoning ordinance required a frontage of 75 feet and total area of 7,500 square feet), Weingarten sought a variance, proposing to build a narrow but deep four-bedroom home. Neighbors opposed this plan, and the board of adjustment denied the variance, finding “that the applicant failed to demonstrate any evidence to establish hardship” and “that the granting of the variance would substantially impair the intent and purpose of the Zone Plan and Zoning Ordinance of the Borough of Westwood.”</p>
<p id="e154e6fe-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On appeal by Weingarten, the court held that the record did not support the board of adjustment’s conclusions. The board could not base its decision on the size of the house, because the planned construction did not violate any of the traditional zoning purposes of light, air, and open space reflected in the ordinance. And while minimum lot size requirements, “conserving the value of the surrounding properties,” and “aesthetic considerations” were all appropriate “desiderata of zoning,” the board did not rest its decision on evidence about such matters, but instead simply drew conclusions that were unsupported by the facts.</p>
<p id="e154e6ff-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Until the 1947 amendment to the zoning ordinance the plaintiffs or their predecessors in title could have constructed a one-family house on the lot. Ownership commenced in 1927 when the Borough of Westwood had no zoning ordinance. Furthermore an attempt, albeit unsuccessful, had been made to acquire an additional ten-foot strip from Mr. Butler, owner of the property bordering to the south. A 40-foot frontage would have at least brought the property into conformity with one home in the neighborhood and within close proximity of the size of the lots of two other houses. In addition there had been discussion concerning the possible sale of the property to a neighbor, there being a substantial divergence in the offering and asking prices. Lastly, one could reasonably conclude that, if a variance were not granted, the land would be zoned into inutility. In view of all the above, it cannot be said that there was not any evidence to establish hardship.</p>
<p id="e154e700-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Passing to the [questions of impact on the public good and on the general zoning plan], the board of adjustment made only the conclusive statement that the variance would substantially impair the intent and purpose of the zone plan and ordinance. The manner in which the variance would cause that effect is not explained. The board found that the lot was the only 30-foot parcel in the block, <span title="587" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-587">p. 587</span>that the applicant builder had never constructed a house on a 30-foot lot, and that the proposed house would be 19 feet in width. How these facts relate to the zone plan is not made clear. The proposed use, side yards and setback meet the requirements of the ordinance. The proposed sales price of the home would be within the range of the value of the houses in the neighborhood. The total acreage of the land, exceeding 5,000 square feet, is comparable to 17 other properties in the neighborhood.”</p>
<p id="e154e701-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court remanded for further proceedings, noting not only that the board should address the problems noted by the court, but also that the applicant—who had the burden of proof—should submit plans for the proposed house.</p>

<p id="e154e704-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Conditional variances.</i></b> In granting a variance, zoning boards may impose reasonable conditions related to the use of the property that minimize the adverse impact of the use on neighbors. Such conditions may relate, for example, to fences, landscaping, outdoor lighting and noises, and enclosure of buildings. On the other hand, zoning boards may not condition a variance upon use of the property by the original applicants only, as this has no relation to ameliorating the effects of the proposed land use and is unrelated to the legitimate purposes of zoning. A variance thus must “run with the land.” St. Onge v. Donovan, 522 N.E.2d 1019 (N.Y. 1988).</p>
<p id="e154e705-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Area versus use.</i></b> The <i>Commons</i> case involved a so-called area (or dimensional) variance, having to do with setback requirements and the like, as opposed to a use variance relaxing restrictions on permissible uses in a particular area (e.g., allowing a commercial use in a residential zone). The burden of proof is said to be greater for a use variance than for an area variance. See, e.g., Hertzberg v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment of Pittsburgh, 721 A.2d 43 (Pa. 1998).</p>
<p id="e154e706-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why might this be? Does an area variance necessarily have less impact on the neighborhood than a use variance? And as between area and use, is it always clear which is which?</p>

<p id="e154e709-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second method of avoiding hardships from rigid zoning enforcement is the <i>special exception</i>. Special exceptions (sometimes called <i>conditional uses</i>) differ from variances in that while a variance is an administratively authorized departure from the terms of the zoning ordinance, “an exception is a use <i>permitted by the ordinance</i> in a district in which it is not necessarily incompatible, but where it might cause harm if not watched.” Daniel R. Mandelker, Delegation of Power and Function in Zoning Administration, 1963 Wash. U. L.Q. 60, 62-63 (emphasis added). Typical exceptions require large amounts of land and involve uses that have the potential to cause injury to the surrounding area. Examples include airports, landfills, and hospitals. The harms involved might be noise or traffic. Hence the zoning board grants exceptions on a case-by-case basis, and only after satisfying itself that the proposed use will not cause harm in the specific location involved.</p>

<p id="e154e70c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>State v. City of Rochester, 268 N.W.2d 885 (Minn. 1978).</b> The case involves zoning amendments, another way to provide flexibility. A single tract of land in Rochester, Minnesota bordered single-family homes, multiple-family dwellings, and a vacant lot zoned for “institutional” use and owned by the Mayo Clinic. High-rise condominiums and the Mayo Clinic Complex were one block away and visible from the tract, and the central business district was three blocks away. The tract was zoned for low-density residential use (multiple-family dwellings), but the owner wanted to build a 49-unit “luxury condominium,” so he applied to have the property rezoned for high-density residential use. The Rochester city council approved his application and passed an ordinance rezoning the property. It provided no written reasons or findings supporting the rezoning, but minutes from council meetings showed “that the council members believed the proposed condominium was needed to serve the city’s expanded housing requirements. Council members stated that the Gooding property would be an ideal site since it was located within three blocks of the central business district and since high-density residential uses already across two streets from the property would be compatible with the proposed condominium and made development of the subject property for any other use unlikely.”</p>
<p id="e154e70d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Owners of the neighboring homes appealed the city council decision. They sought closer judicial scrutiny of the rezoning by arguing that it was an administrative or quasi-judicial act. The court rejected the opportunity to apply a higher level of review, saying:</p>
<p id="e154e70e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“[W]e have consistently held that when a municipality adopts or amends a zoning ordinance, it acts in a legislative capacity under its delegated police powers. As a legislative act, a zoning or rezoning classification must be upheld unless opponents prove that the classification is unsupported by any rational basis related to promoting the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare, or that the classification amounts to a taking without compensation. . . . Our narrow scope of review reflects a policy decision that a legislative body can best determine which zoning classifications best serve the public welfare.”</p>
<p id="e154e70f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This left the plaintiffs with the job of convincing the court that the rezoning had no reasonable relation to promoting public health, safety, morals, or general welfare—a very tough sell. Given the proximity of the tract of land to commonly used services (city bus lines, public community centers, a child care center, a city library, the central business district, and a major shopping area) and the fact that the tract was surrounded by medium and high density residential uses, the court concluded that “[t]here was a rational basis for concluding that a six-story condominium would be compatible with existing uses in the neighborhood of the subject property.” Plaintiffs’ arguments that the new condominium would disrupt the neighboring single-family community’s stability and character by increasing noise and traffic, and would make the homes lose some of their value, fell short. “All of these factors may make the reasonableness of the zoning change fairly debatable, but under our standard of review, that is not enough to justify the court’s interfering with the council’s legislative judgment in passing the ordinance.”</p>

<p id="e1550e2e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Over the years since <i>Euclid</i>, the aims of zoning gradually expanded, no doubt for a host of reasons—population growth, increased pressures on the public fisc, the rise of activist government generally, racial prejudice, an expanding environmental consciousness, and so on. Zoning authorities began taking initiatives that the Court in <i>Euclid</i> would never have imagined. We shall concentrate on the rise of three factors in zoning: aesthetics, household composition, and the nature and size of local populations.</p>

Upon summary judgment the trial court issued a peremptory writ of mandamus to compel appellant to issue a residential building permit to respondents. The trial court’s judgment is that the below-mentioned ordinances are violative of Section 10, Article I of the Constitution of Missouri, 1945, V.A.M.S., in that restrictions placed by the ordinances on the use of property deprive the owners of their property without due process of law. Relators’ petition pleads that they applied to appellant Building Commissioner for a building permit to allow them to construct a single family residence in the City of Ladue, and that plans and specifications were submitted for the proposed residence, which was unusual in design, “but complied with all existing building and zoning regulations and ordinances of the City of Ladue, Missouri.”</p>
<p id="e1553547-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is further pleaded that relators were refused a building permit for the construction of their proposed residence upon the ground that the permit was not approved by the Architectural Board of the City of Ladue. Ordinance 131, as amended by Ordinance 281 of that city, purports to set up an Architectural Board to approve plans and specifications for buildings and structures erected within the city and in a preamble to</p>

</div>
<p id="e1553549-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is asserted in the petition that the ordinances are invalid, illegal and void, “are unconstitutional in that they are vague and provide no standard nor uniform rule by which to guide the architectural board,” that the city acted in excess of statutory powers (§89.020, RS Mo 1959, V.A.M.S.) in enacting the ordinances, which “attempt to allow respondent to impose aesthetic standards for buildings in the City of Ladue, and are in excess of the powers granted the City of Ladue by said statute.”</p>
<p id="e155354a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Relators filed a motion for summary judgment and affidavits were filed in opposition thereto. Richard D. Shelton, Mayor of the City of Ladue, deposed that the facts in appellant’s answer were true and correct, as here pertinent: that the City of Ladue constitutes one of the finer suburban residential areas of Metropolitan St. Louis, the homes therein are considerably more expensive than in cities of comparable size, being homes on lots from three fourths of an acre to three or more acres each; that a zoning ordinance was enacted by the city regulating the height, number of stories, size of buildings, percentage of lot occupancy, yard sizes, and the location and use of buildings and land for trade, industry, residence and other purposes; that the zoning regulations were made in accordance with a comprehensive plan “designed to <span title="591" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-591">p. 591</span>promote the health and general welfare of the residents of the City of Ladue,” which in furtherance of said objectives duly enacted said Ordinances numbered 131 and 281. Appellant also asserted in his answer that these ordinances were a reasonable exercise of the city’s governmental, legislative and police powers, as determined by its legislative body, and as stated in the above-quoted preamble to the ordinances. It is then pleaded that relators’ description of their proposed residence as “ ‘unusual in design’ is the understatement of the year. It is in fact a monstrosity of grotesque design, which would seriously impair the value of property in the neighborhood.”</p>
<p id="e155354b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The affidavit of Harold C. Simon, a developer of residential subdivisions in St. Louis County, is that he is familiar with relators’ lot upon which they seek to build a house, and with the surrounding houses in the neighborhood; that the houses therein existent are virtually all two-story houses of conventional architectural design, such as Colonial, French Provincial or English; and that the house which relators propose to construct is of ultramodern design which would clash with and not be in conformity with any other house in the entire neighborhood. It is Mr. Simon’s opinion that the design and appearance of relators’ proposed residence would have a substantial adverse effect upon the market values of other residential property in the neighborhood, such average market value ranging from $60,000 to $85,000 each.</p>
<p id="e155354c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a part of the affidavit of Russell H. Riley, consultant for the city planning and engineering firm of Harland Bartholomew &amp; Associates, photographic exhibits of homes surrounding relators’ lot were attached. . . . [The surrounding houses consisted of a conventional frame residence, several of a Colonial style, and one of a Tudor style.] In substance Mr. Riley went on to say that the City of Ladue is one of the finer residential suburbs in the St. Louis area. . . . The homes are considerably more expensive than average homes found in a city of comparable size. The ordinance which has been adopted by the City of Ladue is typical of those which have been adopted by a number of suburban cities in St. Louis County and in similar cities throughout the United States, the need therefor being based upon the protection of existing property values by preventing the construction of houses that are in complete conflict with the general type of houses in a given area. The intrusion into this neighborhood of relators’ unusual, grotesque and nonconforming structure would have a substantial adverse effect on market values of other homes in the immediate area. According to Mr. Riley the standards of Ordinance 131, as amended by Ordinance 281, are usually and customarily applied in city planning work and are:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">

It is further contended by relators that Ordinances 131 and 281 are invalid and unconstitutional as being an unreasonable and arbitrary exercise of the police power (as based entirely on aesthetic values); and that the same are invalid as an unlawful delegation of legislative powers (to the Architectural Board).</p>
<p id="e1555c65-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 89.020 provides . . . [for regulation of lot size; height, size, spacing, and use of buildings; and population density—all for the purpose of promoting health, safety, and welfare.] Section 89.040 provides . . . [that regulations be made in accordance with a comprehensive plan and designed “to promote health <i>and the general welfare. . . . Such regulations shall be made with reasonable consideration, among other things, to the character of the district and its peculiar suitability for particular uses, and with a view to conserving the values of buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout such municipality</i>.” (Italics added by the court.)]</p>
<p id="e1555c66-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Relators say that “Neither Sections 89.020 or 89.040 nor any other provision of Chapter 89 mentions or gives a city the authority to regulate architectural design and appearance. There exists no provision providing for an architectural board and no entity even remotely resembling such a board is mentioned under the enabling legislation.” Relators conclude that the City of Ladue lacked any power to adopt Ordinance 131 as amended by Ordinance 281 “and its intrusion into this area is wholly unwarranted and without sanction in the law.” As to this aspect of the appeal realtors rely upon the 1961 decision of State ex rel. Magidson v. Henze, Mo. App., 342 S.W.2d 261. That case had the identical question presented. An Architectural Control Commission was set up by an ordinance of the City of University City. In its report to the Building Commissioner, the Architectural Control Commission disapproved the Magidson application for permits to build four houses. It was commented that the proposed houses did not provide for the minimum number of square feet, and “In considering the existing character of this neighborhood, the Commission is of the opinion that houses of the character proposed in these plans are not in harmony with and will not contribute to nor protect the general welfare of this neighborhood” (loc. cit. 264). The court held that §89.020, RS Mo 1949, V.A.M.S., does not grant to the city the right to impose upon the landowner aesthetic standards for the buildings he chooses to erect.</p>
<p id="e1555c67-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As is clear from the affidavits and attached exhibits, the City of Ladue is an area composed principally of residences of the general types of Colonial, French Provincial and English Tudor. The city has a comprehensive plan of zoning to maintain the general character of buildings therein. The <i>Magidson</i> case, supra, did not consider the effect of §89.040, supra, and the italicized portion relating to the character of the district, its suitability for particular uses, and the conservation of the values of buildings therein. These considerations, sanctioned by statute, are directly related to the general welfare of the community. . . . In Marrs v. City of Oxford (D.C.D. Kan.) 24 F.2d 541, 548, it was said, “The stabilizing of property values, and giving some assurance to the public that, if property is purchased in a residential district, its value as such will be preserved, is probably the most cogent reason back of zoning ordinances.” The preamble to Ordinance 131, quoted above in part, demonstrates that its purpose is to conform to the dictates of §89.040, with reference to preserving values of property by zoning procedure and restrictions on the use of property. This is an illustration of what was referred to in Deimeke v. State Highway Commission, Mo., 444 S.W.2d 480, 484, as a growing number of cases recognizing a change in the scope of the term “general</p>

<p id="e1555c6d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Relators say further that Ordinances 131 and 281 are invalid and unconstitutional as being an unreasonable and arbitrary exercise of the police power. It is argued that a mere reading of these ordinances shows that they are based entirely on aesthetic factors in that the stated purpose of the Architectural Board is to maintain “conformity with surrounding structures” and to assure that structures “conform to certain minimum architectural standards of appearance.” The argument ignores the further provisos in the ordinance: . . . and that unsightly, grotesque and unsuitable structures, <i>detrimental to the stability of value and the welfare of surrounding property, structures, and residents,</i> and <i>to the general welfare and happiness of the community</i>, be avoided, and that appropriate standards of beauty and conformity be fostered and encouraged. (Italics added.) Relators’ proposed residence does not descend to the “ ‘patently offensive character of vehicle graveyards in close proximity to such highways’ ” referred to in the <i>Deimeke</i> case, supra (444 S.W.2d 484). Nevertheless, the aesthetic factor to be taken into account by the Architectural Board is not to be considered alone. Along with that inherent factor is the effect that the proposed residence would have upon the property values in the area. In this time of burgeoning urban areas, congested with people and structures, it is certainly in keeping with the ultimate ideal of general welfare that the Architectural Board, in its function, preserve and protect existing areas in which structures of a general conformity of architecture have been erected. The area under consideration is clearly, from the record, a fashionable one. In State ex rel. Civello v. City of New Orleans, 154 La. 271, 97 So. 440, 444, the court said, “If by the <span title="595" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-595">p. 595</span>term ‘aesthetic considerations’ is meant a regard merely for outward appearances, for good taste in the matter of the beauty of the neighborhood itself, we do not observe any substantial reason for saying that such a consideration is not a matter of general welfare. The beauty of a fashionable residence neighborhood in a city is for the comfort and happiness of the residents, and it sustains in a general way the value of property in the neighborhood.” . . . </p>
<p id="e1555c6e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The denial by appellant of a building permit for relators’ highly modernistic residence in this area where traditional Colonial, French Provincial and English Tudor styles of architecture are erected does not appear to be arbitrary and unreasonable when the basic purpose to be served is that of the general welfare of persons in the entire community.</p>
<p id="e1555c6f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to the above-stated purpose in the preamble to Ordinance 131, it establishes an Architectural Board of three members, all of whom must be architects. Meetings of the Board are to be open to the public, and every application for a building permit, except those not affecting the outward appearance of a building, shall be submitted to the Board along with plans, elevations, detail drawings and specifications, before being approved by the Building Commissioner. The Chairman of the Board shall examine the application to determine if it conforms to proper architectural standards in appearance and design and will be in general conformity with the style and design of surrounding structures and conducive to the proper architectural development of the city. If he so finds, he approves and returns the application to the Building Commissioner. If he does not find conformity, or has doubt, a full meeting of the Board is called, with notice of the time and place thereof given to the applicant. The Board shall disapprove the application if it determines the proposed structure will constitute an unsightly, grotesque or unsuitable structure in appearance, detrimental to the welfare of surrounding property or residents. If it cannot make that decision, the application shall be returned to the Building Commissioner either with or without suggestions or recommendations, and if that is done without disapproval, the Building Commissioner may issue the permit. If the Board’s disapproval is given and the applicant refuses to comply with recommendations, the Building Commissioner shall refuse the permit. Thereafter provisions are made for an appeal to the Council of the city for review of the decision of the Architectural Board. Ordinance 281 amends Ordinance 131 only with respect to the application initially being submitted to and considered by all members of the Architectural Board.</p>
<p id="e1555c70-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Relators claim that the above provisions of the ordinance amount to an unconstitutional delegation of power by the city to the Architectural Board. It is argued that the Board cannot be given the power to determine what is unsightly and grotesque and that the standards, “whether the proposed structure will conform to proper architectural standards in appearance and design, and will be in general conformity with the style and design of surrounding structures and conducive to the proper architectural development of the City . . .” and “the Board shall disapprove the application if it determines that the proposed structure will constitute an unsightly, grotesque or unsuitable structure in appearance, detrimental to the welfare of surrounding property or residents . . . ,” are inadequate. . . . Ordinances 131 and 281 are sufficient in their general standards calling for a factual determination of the suitability of any proposed structure with reference to the character of the surrounding neighborhood and to the determination of any adverse effect on the general welfare and preservation of property values of the community. . . .</p>

<p id="e1555c74-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Nuisance compared.</i></b> Courts, developing the law of nuisance, rarely declared an ugly site a nuisance. Obnoxious smells, deafening noises, yes, but unsightliness, no. There were no common standards to determine beauty; as the old saw puts it, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p id="e1555c75-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As we have seen, courts early viewed zoning under the police power as a form of nuisance control. Naturally, then, by an analogy to nuisance, they held that the police power can be exercised to further public health, safety, and general welfare, but not for purely aesthetic purposes. When billboards proliferated along highways in the first part of the twentieth century, and cities passed ordinances against them, courts first held these ordinances invalid, but, later, as public outrage against blaring billboards grew, courts held they could be regulated as menaces to public health and safety. After all, they might be blown down and fall on someone, they blocked sunlight and air, and the ground behind them might be used for dumping wastes (or doing other bad things). As the Missouri Supreme Court put it in the watershed case, “The sign boards . . . endanger the public health, promote immorality, constitute hiding places and retreats for criminals and all classes of miscreants.” St. Louis Gunning Advertising Co. v. City of St. Louis, 137 S.W. 929, 942 (Mo. 1911), appeal dismissed, 231 U.S. 761 (1913). This disingenuous reasoning, of course, masked the real objection: billboards are ugly.</p>
<p id="e1555c76-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not until the 1950s did courts begin to accept the legitimacy of zoning based exclusively on aesthetic considerations. In Berman v. Parker, 348 U.S. 26 (1954), an urban renewal case involving the use of the federal police power in the District of Columbia, the Supreme Court approved an expanded conception of the “public welfare.” The values it represents, said the Court, “are spiritual as well as physical, aesthetic as well as monetary. It is within the power of the legislature to determine that the community should be beautiful as well as healthy, spacious as well as clean, well-balanced as well as carefully patrolled.” 348 U.S. at 33. Perhaps a majority of jurisdictions today follow <i>Berman</i> and accept aesthetics as a legitimate police power goal in itself. But a good number still waffle on the issue, and a few are opposed to aesthetic regulation.</p>
<p id="e1555c77-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>The basis for the</i> Stoyanoff <i>holding.</i></b> Notice that the court in <i>Stoyanoff</i> did not rest its decision on the legitimacy of aesthetics as a zoning objective, relying instead largely on protection of property values. Professor Frank Michelman observes that this is “escapist reasoning that evades the real issues.” Frank Michelman, Toward a Practical Standard for Aesthetic Regulation, 15 Prac. Law. 36 (1969). He explains:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="e1558388-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The effect on market value, after all, is derivative or symptomatic—not primary or of the essence. If the activities curbed by the regulation would otherwise make the surrounding<b></b> property less valuable, it must be because those activities would radiate some kind of undesirable impact.</p>
<p id="e1558389-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If that impact is received and felt through visual sensibility, then the “economic” interest in question simply masks what has been referred to above as an “aesthetic” interest. In other words, without the aesthetic nuisance, there would be no market devaluation. [Id. at 36-37.]</p>

<p id="e155838a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Sign codes.</i></b> The town of Gilbert, Arizona, enacted a sign code regulating the manner in which people may display outdoor signs. The code identified various categories of signs based on the type of information they conveyed, then subjected each category to different restrictions. One of the categories was “Temporary Directional Signs Relating to a Qualifying Event,” defined as signs directing the public to a meeting of a nonprofit group. The code imposed more stringent restrictions on those signs than it did on signs conveying other messages, including “ideological signs” and “political signs.” In Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 135 S. Ct. 2218 (2015), the Supreme Court struck down Gilbert’s sign code, deeming it to be a content-based restriction on freedom of speech that could be justified only by a compelling governmental interest. The town’s asserted interests in public safety and aesthetic concerns, while legitimate, were not compelling, the Court concluded.</p>

East Cleveland’s housing ordinance, like many throughout the country, limits occupancy of a dwelling unit to members of a single family. § 1351.02. But the ordinance contains an unusual and complicated definitional section that recognizes as a “family” only a few categories of related individuals, § 1341.08.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10522_5eaa6107-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10522_5eaa6107-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">3</a></span> 2 Because her family, living together in her home, fits none of those categories, appellant stands convicted of a criminal offense.

<p id="e155839b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant, Mrs. Inez Moore, lives in her East Cleveland home together with her son, Dale Moore Sr., and her two grandsons, Dale, Jr., and John Moore, Jr. The two boys are first cousins rather than brothers; we are told that John came to live with his grandmother and with the elder and younger Dale Moores after his mother’s death.</p>
<p id="e155839c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In early 1973, Mrs. Moore received a notice of violation from the city, stating that John was an “illegal occupant” and directing her to comply with the ordinance. When she failed to remove him from her home, the city filed a criminal charge. Mrs. Moore moved to dismiss, claiming that the ordinance was constitutionally invalid on its face. Her motion was overruled, and upon conviction she was sentenced to five days in jail and a $25 fine. The Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed after giving full consideration to her constitutional claims, and the Ohio Supreme Court denied review. . . .</p>

<p id="e155839e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The city argues that our decision in Village of Belle Terre v. Boraas, 416 U.S. 1 (1974), requires us to sustain the ordinance attacked here. Belle Terre, like East Cleveland, imposed limits on the types of groups that could occupy a single dwelling unit. Applying the constitutional standard announced in this Court’s leading land-use case, Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365 (1926), we sustained the Belle Terre ordinance on the ground that it bore a rational relationship to permissible state objectives.</p>
<p id="e155839f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But one overriding factor sets this case apart from Belle Terre. The ordinance there affected only unrelated individuals. It expressly allowed all who were related by “blood, adoption, or marriage” to live together, and in sustaining the ordinance we were careful to note that it promoted “family needs” and “family values.” 416 U.S., at 9. East Cleveland, in contrast, has chosen to regulate the occupancy of its housing by slicing deeply into the family itself. This is no mere incidental result of the ordinance. On its face it selects certain categories of relatives who may live together and declares that others may not. In particular, it makes a crime of a grandmother’s choice to live with her grandson in circumstances like those presented here.</p>
<p id="e15583a0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a city undertakes such intrusive regulation of the family, neither <i>Belle Terre</i> nor <i>Euclid</i> governs; the usual judicial deference to the legislature is inappropriate. . . . [W]hen the government intrudes on choices concerning family living arrangements, this Court must examine carefully the importance of the governmental interests advanced and the extent to which they are served by the challenged regulation. </p>
<p id="e15583a1-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When thus examined, this ordinance cannot survive. The city seeks to justify it as a means of preventing overcrowding, minimizing traffic and parking congestion, and avoiding an undue financial burden on East Cleveland’s school system. Although these are legitimate goals, the ordinance before us serves them marginally, at best. For example, the ordinance permits any family consisting only of husband, wife, and unmarried children to live together, even if the family contains a half dozen licensed drivers, each with his or her own car. At the same time it forbids an adult brother and sister to share a household, even if both faithfully use public transportation. The ordinance would permit a grandmother to live with a single <span title="599" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-599">p. 599</span>dependent son and children, even if his school-age children number a dozen, yet it forces Mrs. Moore to find another dwelling for her grandson John, simply because of the presence of his uncle and cousin in the same household. We need not labor the point. Section 1341.08 has but a tenuous relation to alleviation of the conditions mentioned by the city. </p>

<p id="e155aaba-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Belle Terre.</i></b> In Village of Belle Terre v. Boraas, 416 U.S. 1 (1974), the Supreme Court upheld a family zoning ordinance that apparently was aimed at preventing local college students from living together. It defined “family” as “[o]ne or more persons related by blood, adoption, or marriage” or up to two unrelated persons. Six unrelated college students challenged the regulation. Applying a rational basis test, the Court held that the regulation bore a reasonable relationship to legitimate state objectives of regulating noise, parking, and other density-related issues. The dissenting opinion argued that the strict scrutiny test should have been apply because the constitutional rights of association and privacy were involved. </p>
<p id="e155aabb-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court in <i>Moore</i> distinguished the instant case from <i>Belle Terre</i>. Was the Court’s distinction persuasive?</p>
<p id="e155aabc-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Family zoning in the state courts.</i></b> On issues of household composition, some state courts have taken a less deferential position than the Supreme Court did in <i>Belle Terre</i>. A notable example is McMinn v. Town of Oyster Bay, 488 N.E.2d 1240 (N.Y. 1985). The ordinance in <i>McMinn</i> restricted single-family housing to any number of people related by blood, adoption, or marriage, or two people not so related but over age 62. The court invalidated the ordinance on the basis of the due process provision in the New York state constitution. The objectives of the ordinance — controlling density, reducing traffic and noise — were legitimate, but the means were not. Occupancy restrictions based on biological or legal relationships, the court said, had no reasonable relationship to the city’s objectives. But see City of Ladue v. Horn, 720 S.W.2d 745 (Mo. App. 1986) (upholding an ordinance, as applied to an unmarried couple with three children from prior marriages, defining “family” as two or more persons related by blood, adoption, or marriage).</p>

This case presents the question whether a provision in petitioner City of Edmonds’ zoning code qualifies for §3607(b)(1)’s complete exemption from FHA scrutiny. The provision, governing areas zoned for single-family dwelling units, defines “family” as “persons [without regard to number] related by genetics, adoption, or marriage, or a group of five or fewer [unrelated] persons.” Edmonds Community Development Code (ECDC) §21.30.010 (1991).</p>
<p id="e155aac4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defining provision at issue describes who may compose a family unit; it does not prescribe “the maximum number of occupants” a dwelling unit may house. We hold that §3607(b)(1) does not exempt prescriptions of the family-defining kind, i.e., provisions designed to foster the family character of a neighborhood. Instead, §3607(b)(1)’s absolute exemption removes from the FHA’s scope only total occupancy limits, i.e., numerical ceilings that serve to prevent overcrowding in living quarters.</p>

<p id="e155aac6-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the summer of 1990, respondent Oxford House opened a group home in the City of Edmonds, Washington for 10 to 12 adults recovering from alcoholism and drug addiction. The group home, called Oxford House-Edmonds, is located in a neighborhood zoned for single-family residences. Upon learning that Oxford House had leased and was operating a home in Edmonds, the City issued criminal citations to the owner and a resident of the house. The citations charged violation of the zoning code rule that defines who may live in single-family dwelling units. The occupants of such units must compose a “family,” and family, under the City’s defining rule, “means an individual or two or more persons related by genetics, adoption, or marriage, or a group of five or fewer persons who are not related by genetics, adoption, or marriage.” Edmonds Community Development Code (ECDC) §21.30.010. Oxford House-Edmonds houses more than five unrelated persons, and therefore does not conform to the code.</p>
<p id="e155aac7-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Oxford House asserted reliance on the Fair Housing Act, 102 Stat. 1619, 42 U.S.C. §3601 et seq., which declares it unlawful “to discriminate in the sale or rental, or to otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any buyer or renter because of a handicap of . . . that buyer or renter.” §3604(f)(1)(A). The parties have stipulated, for purposes of this litigation, that the residents of Oxford House-Edmonds “are <span title="601" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-601">p. 601</span>recovering alcoholics and drug addicts and are handicapped persons within the meaning” of the Act.</p>
<p id="e155aac8-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Discrimination covered by the FHA includes “a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford [handicapped] persons equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.” §3604(f)(3)(B). Oxford House asked Edmonds to make a “reasonable accommodation” by allowing it to remain in the single-family dwelling it had leased. Group homes for recovering substance abusers, Oxford urged, need 8 to 12 residents to be financially and therapeutically viable. Edmonds declined to permit Oxford House to stay in a single-family residential zone, but passed an ordinance listing group homes as permitted uses in multifamily and general commercial zones.</p>
<p id="e155aac9-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Edmonds sued Oxford House in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington seeking a declaration that the FHA does not constrain the City’s zoning code family definition rule. Oxford House counterclaimed under the FHA, charging the City with failure to make a “reasonable accommodation” permitting maintenance of the group home in a single-family zone. The United States filed a separate action on the same FHA-“reasonable accommodation” ground, and the two cases were consolidated. Edmonds suspended its criminal enforcement actions pending resolution of the federal litigation.</p>
<p id="e155aaca-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court held that ECDC §21.30.010, defining “family,” is exempt from the FHA under §3607(b)(1) as a “reasonable . . . restrictio[n] regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling.” The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed; holding §3607(b)(1)’s absolute exemption inapplicable, the Court of Appeals remanded the cases for further consideration of the claims asserted by Oxford House and the United States. Edmonds v. Washington State Building Code Council, 18 F.3d 802 (1994).</p>
<p id="e155aacb-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Ninth Circuit’s decision conflicts with an Eleventh Circuit decision declaring exempt under §3607(b)(1) a family definition provision similar to the Edmonds prescription. See Elliott v. Athens, 960 F.2d 975 (1992). We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict, and we now affirm the Ninth Circuit’s judgment.</p>

<p id="e155d1e5-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Land use restrictions designate “districts in which only compatible uses are allowed and incompatible uses are excluded.” D. Mandelker, Land Use Law §4.16, pp. 113-114 (3d ed. 1993) (hereinafter Mandelker). These restrictions typically categorize uses as single-family residential, multiple-family residential, commercial, or industrial. See, e.g., 1 E. Ziegler, Jr., Rathkopf’s The Law of Zoning and Planning §8.01, pp. 8-2 to 8-3 (4th ed. 1995); Mandelker §1.03, p. 4; 1 E. Yokley, Zoning Law and Practice §7-2, p. 252 (4th ed. 1978).</p>
<p id="e155d1e6-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Land use restrictions aim to prevent problems caused by the “pig in the parlor instead of the barnyard.” Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365, 388 (1926). In particular, reserving land for single-family residences preserves the character of neighborhoods, securing “zones where family values, youth values, and the blessings of quiet seclusion and clean air make the area a sanctuary for people.” Village of Belle Terre v. Boraas, 416 U.S. 1, 9 (1974); see also Moore v. City of East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494 (1977). To limit land use to single-family residences, a municipality must define the term “family”; thus family composition rules are an essential component of single-family residential use restrictions.</p>
<p id="e155d1e7-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Maximum occupancy restrictions, in contradistinction, cap the number of occupants per dwelling, typically in relation to available floor space or the number and type of rooms. See, e.g., Uniform Housing Code §503(b) (1988); BOCA National Property Maintenance Code §§PM-405.3, PM-405.5 (1993) (hereinafter BOCA Code); Standard Housing Code §§306.1, 306.2 (1991); APHA-CDC Recommended Minimum Housing <span title="603" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-603">p. 603</span>Standards §9.02, p. 37 (1986) (hereinafter APHA-CDC Standards).

See, e.g., BOCA Code §§PM-101.3, PM-405.3, PM-405.5 and commentary; Abbott, Housing Policy, Housing Codes and Tenant Remedies, 56 B.U. L. Rev. 1, 41-45 (1976). . . . </p>
<p id="e155d1e8-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 3607(b)(1)’s language—“restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling”—surely encompasses maximum occupancy restrictions. But the formulation does not fit family composition rules typically tied to land use restrictions. In sum, rules that cap the total number of occupants in order to prevent overcrowding of a dwelling “plainly and unmistakably,” see A.H. Phillips, Inc. v. Walling, 324 U.S. 490, 493 (1945), fall within §3607(b)(1)’s absolute exemption from the FHA’s governance; rules designed to preserve the family character of a neighborhood, fastening on the composition of households rather than on the total number of occupants living quarters can contain, do not.</p>

These provisions do not cap the number of people who may live in a dwelling. In plain terms, they direct that dwellings be used only to house families. Captioned “USES,” ECDC §16.20.010 provides that the sole “Permitted Primary Use” in a single-family residential zone is “single-family dwelling units.” Edmonds itself recognizes that this provision simply “defines those uses permitted in a single family residential zone.”</p>

<p id="e155d1ee-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Edmonds nevertheless argues that its family composition rule, ECDC §21.30.010, falls within §3607(b)(1), the FHA exemption for maximum occupancy restrictions, because the rule caps at five the number of unrelated persons allowed to occupy a single-family dwelling. But Edmonds’ family composition rule surely does not answer the question: “What is the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a house?” So long as they are related “by genetics, adoption, or marriage,” any number of people can live in a house. Ten siblings, their parents and grandparents, for example, could dwell in a house in Edmonds’ single-family residential zone without offending Edmonds’ family composition rule.</p>
<p id="e155d1ef-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Family living, not living space per occupant, is what ECDC §21.30.010 describes. Defining family primarily by biological and legal relationships, the provision also accommodates another group association: five or fewer unrelated people are allowed to live together as though they were family. This accommodation is the peg on which <span title="604" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-604">p. 604</span>Edmonds rests its plea for §3607(b)(1) exemption. Had the City defined a family solely by biological and legal links, §3607(b)(1) would not have been the ground on which Edmonds staked its case. It is curious reasoning indeed that converts a family values preserver into a maximum occupancy restriction once a town adds to a related persons prescription “and also two unrelated persons.”</p>
<p id="e155d1f0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Edmonds additionally contends that subjecting single-family zoning to FHA scrutiny will “overturn Euclidian zoning” and “destroy the effectiveness and purpose of single-family zoning.” This contention both ignores the limited scope of the issue before us and exaggerates the force of the FHA’s antidiscrimination provisions. We address only whether Edmonds’ family composition rule qualifies for §3607(b)(1) exemption. Moreover, the FHA antidiscrimination provisions, when applicable, require only “reasonable” accommodations to afford persons with handicaps “equal opportunity to use and enjoy” housing. §§3604(f)(1)(A) and (f)(3)(B).</p>

<p id="e155f813-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All zoning is exclusionary by definition: Its central purpose is to minimize or eliminate unwanted effects—externalities—in a given district, whether the effects be caused by typical nuisances (<i>Euclid</i>’s pig in a parlor), by apartments or commercial uses in a high-class single family residential zone, or by group homes. Commonly, however, zoning measures like these aim not to ban uses (nuisances aside), but rather to relegate them to what the zoners regard as their proper place in the community. Contrast another kind of exclusionary zoning, the kind to which that phrase particularly refers today: measures whose purpose or effect is essentially to close an entire community to unwanted groups—typically people of low income who might put a heavy burden on the public fisc, yet at the same time contribute little to it, resulting in increased property taxes and reduced land values throughout the community. The attitude here is, “Let them go elsewhere, to some other city.”</p>

But they are not the only category of persons barred from so many municipalities by reason of restrictive land use regulations. We have reference to young and elderly couples, single persons and large, growing families not in the poverty class, but who still cannot afford the only kinds of housing realistically permitted in most places—relatively high-priced, single-family detached dwellings on sizeable lots and, in some municipalities, expensive apartments. We will, therefore, consider the case from the wider viewpoint that the effect of Mount Laurel’s land use regulation has been to prevent various categories of persons from living in the township because of the limited extent of their income and resources. In this connection, we accept the presentation of the municipality’s counsel at oral argument that the regulatory scheme was not adopted with any desire or intent to exclude prospective residents on the obviously illegal bases of race, origin or believed social incompatibility. . . . </p>

<p id="e155f81f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mount Laurel is a flat, sprawling township, 22 square miles, or about 14,000 acres, in area, on the west central edge of Burlington County. . . . </p>
<p id="e155f820-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1950, the township had a population of 2,817, only about 600 more people than it had in 1940. It was then, as it had been for decades, primarily a rural agricultural area with no sizeable settlements or commercial or industrial enterprises. The populace generally lived in individual houses scattered along country roads. There were several pockets of poverty, with deteriorating or dilapidated housing (apparently 300 or so units of which remain today in equally poor condition). After 1950, as in so many other municipalities similarly situated, residential development and some commerce and industry began to come in. By 1960 the population had almost doubled to 5,249 and by 1970 had more than doubled again to 11,221. These new residents were, of course, “outsiders” from the nearby central cities and older suburbs or from more distant places drawn here by reason of employment in the region. The township is now definitely a part of the outer ring of the South Jersey metropolitan area, which area we define as those portions of Camden, Burlington and Gloucester Counties within a semicircle having a radius of 20 miles or so from the heart of Camden city. And 65% of the township is still vacant land or in agricultural use.</p>
<p id="e155f821-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The growth of the township has been spurred by the construction or improvement of main highways through or near it. . . . This highway network gives the township a most strategic location from the standpoint of transport of goods and people by truck and private car. There is no other means of transportation.</p>
<span title="607" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-607">p. 607</span>
<p id="e1561f32-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The location and nature of development have been, as usual, controlled by the local zoning enactments. The general ordinance presently in force, which was declared invalid by the trial court, was adopted in 1964. We understand that earlier enactments provided, however, basically the same scheme but were less restrictive as to residential development. The growth pattern dictated by the ordinance is typical.</p>
<p id="e1561f33-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the present ordinance, 29.2% of all the land in the township, or 4,121 acres, is zoned for industry. This amounts to 2,800 more acres than were so zoned by the 1954 ordinance. . . . </p>
<p id="e1561f34-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Only industry meeting specified performance standards is permitted. The effect is to limit the use substantially to light manufacturing, research, distribution of goods, offices and the like. Some nonindustrial uses, such as agriculture, farm dwellings, motels, a harness racetrack, and certain retail sales and service establishments, are permitted in this zone. At the time of trial no more than 100 acres . . . were actually occupied by industrial uses. They had been constructed in recent years, mostly in several industrial parks, and involved tax ratables of about 16 million dollars. The rest of the land so zoned has remained undeveloped. If it were fully utilized, the testimony was that about 43,500 industrial jobs would be created, but it appeared clear that, as happens in the case of so many municipalities, much more land has been so zoned than the reasonable potential for industrial movement or expansion warrants. At the same time, however, the land cannot be used for residential development under the general ordinance.</p>
<p id="e1561f35-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The amount of land zoned for retail business use under the general ordinance is relatively small—169 acres, or 1.2% of the total. . . . </p>
<p id="e1561f36-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While the greater part of the land so zoned appears to be in use, there is no major shopping center or concentrated retail commercial area—“downtown”— in the township.</p>
<p id="e1561f37-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The balance of the land area, almost 10,000 acres, has been developed until recently in the conventional form of major subdivisions. The general ordinance provides for four residential zones, designated R-1, R-1D, R-2 and R-3. All permit only single-family, detached dwellings, one house per lot—the usual form of grid development. Attached townhouses, apartments (except on farms for agricultural workers) and mobile homes are not allowed anywhere in the township under the general ordinance. This dwelling development, resulting in the previously mentioned quadrupling of the population, has been largely confined to the R-1 and R-2 districts in two sections . . . . The result has been quite intensive development of these sections, but at a low density. The dwellings are substantial . . . . A variation from conventional development has recently occurred in some parts of Mount Laurel, as in a number of other similar municipalities, by use of the land use regulation device known as “planned unit development” (PUD). This scheme differs from the traditional in that the type, density and placement of land uses and buildings, instead of being detailed and confined to specified districts by local legislation in advance, is determined by contract, or “deal,” as to each development between the developer and the municipal administrative authority, under broad guidelines laid down by state enabling legislation and an implementing local ordinance. The stress is on regulation of density and permitted mixture of uses within the same area, including various kinds of living accommodations with or without commercial and industrial enterprises. The idea may be basically thought of as the creation of “new towns” in virgin territory, full-blown or in miniature, although most frequently the concept has been limited in practice, as in Mount Laurel, to residential developments <span title="608" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-608">p. 608</span>of various sizes having some variety of housing and perhaps some retail establishments to serve the inhabitants. . . . </p>
<p id="e1561f38-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These projects, three in the southwesterly sector and one in the northeasterly sector, are very substantial and involve at least 10,000 sale and rental housing units of various types to be erected over a period of years. Their bounds were created by agreement rather than legislative specification on the zoning map, invading industrial, R-1, R-1D, R-3 and even flood plain zones. If completed as planned, they will in themselves ultimately quadruple the 1970 township population, but still leave a good part of the township undeveloped. (The record does not indicate how far development in each of the projects has progressed.) While multi-family housing in the form of rental garden, medium rise and high rise apartments and attached townhouses is for the first time provided for, as well as single-family detached dwellings for sale, it is not designed to accommodate and is beyond the financial reach of low and moderate income families, especially those with young children. The aim is quite the contrary; as with the single-family homes in the older conventional subdivisions, only persons of medium and upper income are sought as residents.</p>
<p id="e1561f39-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A few details will furnish sufficient documentation. Each of the resolutions of tentative approval of the projects contains a similar fact finding to the effect that the development will attract a highly educated and trained population base to support the nearby industrial parks in the township as well as the business and commercial facilities. The approvals also sharply limit the number of apartments having more than one bedroom. Further, they require that the developer must provide in its leases that no school-age children shall be permitted to occupy any one-bedroom apartment and that no more than two such children shall reside in any two-bedroom unit. The developer is also required, prior to the issuance of the first building permit, to record a covenant, running with all land on which multi-family housing is to be constructed, providing that in the event more than .3 school children per multi-family unit shall attend the township school system in any one year, the developer will pay the cost of tuition and other school expenses of all such excess numbers of children. In addition, low density, required amenities, such as central air conditioning, and specified developer contributions help to push rents and sales prices to high levels. These contributions include fire apparatus, ambulances, fire houses, and very large sums of money for educational facilities, a cultural center and the township library.</p>
<p id="e1561f3a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Still another restrictive land use regulation was adopted by the township through a supplement to the general zoning ordinance enacted in September 1972 creating a new zone, R-4, Planned Adult Retirement Community (PARC). . . . The extensive development requirements detailed in the ordinance make it apparent that the scheme was not designed for, and would be beyond the means of, low and moderate income retirees. . . . </p>
<p id="e1561f3b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All this affirmative action for the benefit of certain segments of the population is in sharp contrast to the lack of action, and indeed hostility, with respect to affording any opportunity for decent housing for the township’s own poor living in substandard accommodations, found largely in the section known as Springville (R-3 zone). . . . In 1968 a private non-profit association sought to build subsidized, multi-family housing in the Springville section with funds to be granted by a higher level governmental agency. Advance municipal approval of the project was required. The Township Committee responded with a purportedly approving resolution, which found a need for “moderate” income housing in the area, but went on to specify that such housing <span title="609" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-609">p. 609</span>must be constructed subject to all zoning, planning, building and other applicable ordinances and codes. This meant single-family detached dwellings on 20,000 square foot lots. (Fear was also expressed that such housing would attract low income families from outside the township.) Needless to say, such requirements killed realistic housing for this group of low and moderate income families.</p>
<p id="e1561f3c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The record thoroughly substantiates the findings of the trial court that over the years Mount Laurel “has acted affirmatively to control development and to attract a selective type of growth” and that “through its zoning ordinances has exhibited economic discrimination in that the poor have been deprived of adequate housing and the opportunity to secure the construction of subsidized housing, and has used federal, state, county and local finances and resources solely for the betterment of middle and upper-income persons.”</p>
<p id="e1561f3d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There cannot be the slightest doubt that the reason for this course of conduct has been to keep down local taxes on <i>property</i> (Mount Laurel is not a high tax municipality) and that the policy was carried out without regard for non-fiscal considerations with respect to <i>people</i>, either within or without its boundaries. This conclusion is demonstrated not only by what was done and what happened, as we have related, but also by innumerable direct statements of municipal officials at public meetings over the years which are found in the exhibits. . . . </p>
<p id="e1561f3e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This policy of land use regulation for a fiscal end derives from New Jersey’s tax structure, which has imposed on local real estate most of the cost of municipal and county government and of the primary and secondary education of the municipality’s children. The latter expense is much the largest, so, basically, the fewer the school children, the lower the tax rate. Sizeable industrial and commercial ratables are eagerly sought and homes and the lots on which they are situate are required to be large enough, through minimum lot sizes and minimum floor areas, to have substantial value in order to produce greater tax revenues to meet school costs. Large families who cannot afford to buy large houses and must live in cheaper rental accommodations are definitely not wanted, so we find drastic bedroom restrictions for, or complete prohibition of, multi-family or other feasible housing for those of lesser income.</p>
<p id="e1561f3f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This pattern of land use regulation has been adopted for the same purpose in developing municipality after developing municipality. Almost every one acts solely in its own selfish and parochial interest and in effect builds a wall around itself to keep out those people or entities not adding favorably to the tax base, despite the location of the municipality or the demand for varied kinds of housing. There has been no effective intermunicipal or area planning or land use regulation. All of this is amply demonstrated by the evidence in this case as to Camden, Burlington and Gloucester counties. . . . </p>
<p id="e1561f40-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One incongruous result is the picture of developing municipalities rendering it impossible for lower paid employees of industries they have eagerly sought and welcomed with open arms (and, in Mount Laurel’s case, even some of its own lower paid municipal employees) to live in the community where they work. . . . </p>
<p id="e1561f41-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>II.</b></p>
<p id="e1561f42-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>The Legal Issue</i></p>
<p id="e1561f43-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The legal question before us, as earlier indicated, is whether a developing municipality like Mount Laurel may validly, by a system of land use regulation, make it physically and economically impossible to provide low and moderate income housing <span title="610" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-610">p. 610</span>in the municipality for the various categories of persons who need and want it and thereby, as Mount Laurel has, exclude such people from living within its confines because of the limited extent of their income and resources. Necessarily implicated are the broader questions of the right of such municipalities to limit the kinds of available housing and of any obligation to make possible a variety and choice of types of living accommodations.</p>
<p id="e1561f44-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that every such municipality must, by its land use regulations, presumptively make realistically possible an appropriate variety and choice of housing. More specifically, presumptively it cannot foreclose the opportunity of the classes of people mentioned for low and moderate income housing and in its regulations must affirmatively afford that opportunity, at least to the extent of the municipality’s fair share of the present and prospective regional need therefor. These obligations must be met unless the particular municipality can sustain the heavy burden of demonstrating peculiar circumstances which dictate that it should not be required so to do.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1078A_5eaa6107-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1078A_5eaa6107-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">7</a></span></p>
<p id="e1561f46-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We reach this conclusion under state law and so do not find it necessary to consider federal constitutional grounds urged by plaintiffs. We begin with some fundamental principles as applied to the scene before us.</p>
<p id="e1561f47-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Land use regulation is encompassed within the state’s police power. . . . </p>
<p id="e1561f48-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is elementary theory that all police power enactments, no matter at what level of government, must conform to the basic state constitutional requirements of substantive due process and equal protection of the laws. . . . </p>
<p id="e1561f49-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is required that, affirmatively, a zoning regulation, like any police power enactment, must promote public health, safety, morals or the general welfare. (The last term seems broad enough to encompass the others.) Conversely, a zoning enactment which is contrary to the general welfare is invalid. . . . </p>
<p id="e1561f4a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . Frequently the decisions in this state . . . have spoken only in terms of the interest of the enacting municipality, so that it has been thought, at least in some quarters, that such was the only welfare requiring consideration. It is, of course, true that many cases have dealt only with regulations having little, if any, outside impact where the local decision is ordinarily entitled to prevail. However, it is fundamental and not to be forgotten that the zoning power is a police power of the state and the local authority is acting only as a delegate of that power and is restricted in the same manner as is the state. So, when regulation does have a substantial external impact, the welfare of the state’s citizens beyond the borders of the particular municipality cannot be disregarded and must be recognized and served. . . . </p>
<p id="e1561f4b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This brings us to the relation of housing to the concept of general welfare just discussed and the result in terms of land use regulation which that relationship mandates. There cannot be the slightest doubt that shelter, along with food, are the most basic human needs. . . . </p>
<p id="e1561f4c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is plain beyond dispute that proper provision for adequate housing of all categories of people is certainly an absolute essential in promotion of the general welfare required in all local land use regulation. Further the universal and constant need for such housing is so important and of such broad public interest that the general welfare which developing municipalities like Mount Laurel must consider extends beyond their boundaries and cannot be parochially confined to the claimed good of the particular <span title="611" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-611">p. 611</span>municipality. It has to follow that, broadly speaking, the presumptive obligation arises for each such municipality affirmatively to plan and provide, by its land use regulations, the reasonable opportunity for an appropriate variety and choice of housing, including, of course, low and moderate cost housing, to meet the needs, desires and resources of all categories of people who may desire to live within its boundaries. Negatively, it may not adopt regulations or policies which thwart or preclude that opportunity.</p>
<p id="e1561f4d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is also entirely clear, as we pointed out earlier, that most developing municipalities, including Mount Laurel, have not met their affirmative or negative obligations, primarily for local fiscal reasons. . . . </p>
<p id="e1561f4e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, we are satisfied beyond any doubt that, by reason of the basic importance of appropriate housing and the long-standing pressing need for it, especially in the low and moderate cost category, and of the exclusionary zoning practices of so many municipalities, conditions have changed, and . . . judicial attitudes must be altered . . . to require, as we have just said, a broader view of the general welfare and the presumptive obligation on the part of developing municipalities at least to afford the opportunity by land use regulations for appropriate housing for all.</p>
<p id="e1561f4f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have spoken of this obligation of such municipalities as “presumptive.” The term has two aspects, procedural and substantive. Procedurally, we think the basic importance of appropriate housing for all dictates that, when it is shown that a developing municipality in its land use regulations has not made realistically possible a variety and choice of housing, including adequate provision to afford the opportunity for low and moderate income housing or has expressly prescribed requirements or restrictions which preclude or substantially hinder it, a facial showing of violation of substantive due process or equal protection under the state constitution has been made out and the burden, and it is a heavy one, shifts to the municipality to establish a valid basis for its action or non-action. . . . </p>
<p id="e1561f50-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The substantive aspect of “presumptive” relates to the specifics, on the one hand, of what municipal land use regulation provisions, or the absence thereof, will evidence invalidity and shift the burden of proof and, on the other hand, of what bases and considerations will carry the municipality’s burden and sustain what it has done or failed to do. Both kinds of specifics may well vary between municipalities according to peculiar circumstances.</p>
<p id="e1564661-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We turn to application of these principles in appraisal of Mount Laurel’s zoning ordinance, useful as well, we think, as guidelines for future application in other municipalities.</p>
<p id="e1564662-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The township’s general zoning ordinance . . . permits, as we have said, only one type of housing—single-family detached dwellings. This means that all other types—multi-family including garden apartments and other kinds housing more than one family, town (row) houses, mobile home parks—are prohibited. Concededly, low and moderate income housing has been intentionally excluded. . . . </p>
<p id="e1564663-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mount Laurel’s zoning ordinance is also so restrictive in its minimum lot area, lot frontage and building size requirements, earlier detailed, as to preclude single-family housing for even moderate income families. . . . Again it is evident these requirements increase the size and so the cost of housing. The conclusion is irresistible that Mount Laurel permits only such middle and upper income housing as it believes will have sufficient taxable value to come close to paying its own governmental way. . . . </p>
<p id="e1564664-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Without further elaboration at this point, our opinion is that Mount Laurel’s zoning ordinance is presumptively contrary to the general welfare and outside the intended <span title="612" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-612">p. 612</span>scope of the zoning power in the particulars mentioned. A facial showing of invalidity is thus established, shifting to the municipality the burden of establishing valid superseding reasons for its action and non-action. We now examine the reasons it advances.</p>
<p id="e1564665-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The township’s principal reason in support of its zoning plan and ordinance housing provisions, advanced especially strongly at oral argument, is the fiscal one previously adverted to, i.e., that by reason of New Jersey’s tax structure which substantially finances municipal governmental and educational costs from taxes on local real property, every municipality may, by the exercise of the zoning power, allow only such uses and to such extent as will be beneficial to the local tax rate.</p>
<p id="e1564666-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have previously held that a developing municipality may properly zone for and seek industrial ratables to create a better economic balance for the community vis-à-vis educational and governmental costs engendered by residential development, provided that such was “. . . done reasonably as part of and in furtherance of a legitimate comprehensive plan for the zoning of the entire municipality.” Gruber v. Mayor and Township Committee of Raritan Township, 39 N.J. 1, 9-11, 186 A.2d 489, 493 (1962). We adhere to that view today. But we were not there concerned with, and did not pass upon, the validity of municipal exclusion by zoning of types of housing and kinds of people for the same local financial end. We have no hesitancy in now saying, and do so emphatically, that, considering the basic importance of the opportunity for appropriate housing for all classes of our citizenry, no municipality may exclude or limit categories of housing for that reason or purpose. While we fully recognize the increasingly heavy burden of local taxes for municipal governmental and school costs on homeowners, relief from the consequences of this tax system will have to be furnished by other branches of government. It cannot legitimately be accomplished by restricting types of housing through the zoning process in developing municipalities. . . . </p>
<p id="e1564667-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By way of summary, what we have said comes down to this. As a developing municipality, Mount Laurel must, by its land use regulations, make realistically possible the opportunity for an appropriate variety and choice of housing for all categories of people who may desire to live there, of course including those of low and moderate income. It must permit multi-family housing, without bedroom or similar restrictions, as well as small dwellings on very small lots, low cost housing of other types and, in general, high density zoning, without artificial and unjustifiable minimum requirements as to lot size, building size and the like, to meet the full panoply of these needs. Certainly when a municipality zones for industry and commerce for local tax benefit purposes, it without question must zone to permit adequate housing within the means of the employees involved in such uses. (If planned unit developments are authorized, one would assume that each must include a reasonable amount of low and moderate income housing in its residential “mix,” unless opportunity for such housing has already been realistically provided for elsewhere in the municipality.) The amount of land removed from residential use by allocation to industrial and commercial purposes must be reasonably related to the present and future potential for such purposes. In other words, such municipalities must zone primarily for the living welfare of people and not for the benefit of the local tax rate.</p>
<p id="e1564668-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . Frequently it might be sounder to have more of such housing, like some specialized land uses, in one municipality in a region than in another, because of greater availability of suitable land, location of employment, accessibility of public transportation or some other significant reason. But, under present New Jersey legislation, zoning must be on an individual municipal basis, rather than regionally. So long as that <span title="613" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-613">p. 613</span>situation persists under the present tax structure, or in the absence of some kind of binding agreement among all the municipalities of a region, we feel that every municipality therein must bear its fair share of the regional burden. (In this respect our holding is broader than that of the trial court, which was limited to Mount Laurel-related low and moderate income housing needs.)</p>
<p id="e1564669-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The composition of the applicable “region” will necessarily vary from situation to situation and probably no hard and fast rule will serve to furnish the answer in every case. Confinement to or within a certain county appears not to be realistic, but restriction within the boundaries of the state seems practical and advisable. (This is not to say that a developing municipality can ignore a demand for housing within its boundaries on the part of people who commute to work in another state.) Here we have already defined the region at present as “those portions of Camden, Burlington and Gloucester Counties within a semicircle having a radius of 20 miles or so from the heart of Camden City.” The concept of “fair share” is coming into more general use and, through the expertise of the municipal planning adviser, the county planning boards and the state planning agency, a reasonable figure for Mount Laurel can be determined, which can then be translated to the allocation of sufficient land therefor on the zoning map. . . . </p>
<p id="e156466a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no reason why developing municipalities like Mount Laurel, required by this opinion to afford the opportunity for all types of housing to meet the needs of various categories of people, may not become and remain attractive, viable communities providing good living and adequate services for all their residents in the kind of atmosphere which a democracy and free institutions demand. They can have industrial sections, commercial sections and sections for every kind of housing from low cost and multi-family to lots of more than an acre with very expensive homes. Proper planning and governmental cooperation can prevent over-intensive and too sudden development, insure against future suburban sprawl and slums and assure the preservation of open space and local beauty. We do not intend that developing municipalities shall be overwhelmed by voracious land speculators and developers if they use the powers which they have intelligently and in the broad public interest. Under our holdings today, they can be better communities for all than they previously have been.</p>

<p id="e156466c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>The Remedy</i></p>
<p id="e156466d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . We are of the view that the trial court’s judgment should be modified in certain respects. We see no reason why the entire zoning ordinance should be nullified. Therefore we declare it to be invalid only to the extent and in the particulars set forth in this opinion. The township is granted 90 days from the date hereof, or such additional time as the trial court may find it reasonable and necessary to allow, to adopt amendments to correct the deficiencies herein specified. It is the local function and responsibility, in the first instance at least, rather than the court’s, to decide on the details of the same within the guidelines we have laid down. If plaintiffs desire to attack such amendments, they may do so by supplemental complaint filed in this cause within 30 days of the final adoption of the amendments.</p>
<p id="e156466e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are not at all sure what the trial judge had in mind as ultimate action with reference to the approval of a plan for affirmative public action concerning the satisfaction of indicated housing needs and the entry of a final order requiring implementation thereof. Courts do not build housing nor do municipalities. That function <span title="614" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-614">p. 614</span>is performed by private builders, various kinds of associations, or, for public housing, by special agencies created for that purpose at various levels of government. The municipal function is initially to provide the opportunity through appropriate land use regulations and we have spelled out what Mount Laurel must do in that regard. It is not appropriate at this time, particularly in view of the advanced view of zoning law as applied to housing laid down by this opinion, to deal with the matter of the further extent of judicial power in the field or to exercise any such power. . . . The municipality should first have full opportunity to itself act without judicial supervision. We trust it will do so in the spirit we have suggested, both by appropriate zoning ordinance amendments and whatever additional action encouraging the fulfillment of its fair share of the regional need for low and moderate income housing may be indicated as necessary and advisable. (We have in mind that there is at least a moral obligation in a municipality to establish a local housing agency pursuant to state law to provide housing for its resident poor now living in dilapidated, unhealthy quarters.) The portion of the trial court’s judgment ordering the preparation and submission of the aforesaid study, report and plan to it for further action is therefore vacated as at least premature. Should Mount Laurel not perform as we expect, further judicial action may be sought by supplemental pleading in this cause.</p>
<p id="e156466f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judgment of the Law Division is modified as set forth herein.</p>

<p id="e1564672-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Exclusionary zoning in general.</i></b> Exclusionary zoning is not just a thing of the past. For the last 50 years at least, suburban communities have resorted to various measures in an effort to restrict or bar particular uses—such as apartments, small houses on small lots, mobile homes—and to limit or foreclose entry by particular people, especially the poor and racial minorities.</p>
<p id="e1564673-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Simple prejudice has much to do with exclusionary efforts, but—as the court in <i>Mount Laurel</i> indicates—fiscal concerns are also a powerful motivation. Ideally, <i>all</i> communities want low property taxes. Citizens obviously would rather spend their money in other ways, and they like the fact that low property taxes buoy up property values. Public officials want contented citizens who will keep them in office.</p>
<p id="e1564674-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The straightforward way to achieve relatively low taxes is to have a handsome tax base (valuable property, especially nonresidential property), well-to-do residents, and low demand for such public services as water and sewer, schools, police and fire departments, public assistance programs, and so on. Translated into policy, this means measures to ensure a community of substantial and desirable industrial uses and expensive homes located in a low density manner (say on large lots). With such a policy in place, residents will necessarily tend to have high incomes; the typical family will have few children. Most of the workers in the local industries will be unable to live in the community or in other suburbs nearby (the other suburbs will be using exclusionary measures to pursue their own fiscal aims). They will reside in the central city.</p>
<p id="e1564675-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Exclusionary zoning techniques.</i></b> Putting aside blatant efforts to exclude racial minorities and the poor, and focusing on residential uses, there are a number of techniques a community might use to exclude people whose characteristics <span title="615" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-615">p. 615</span>(low income, high service demand) would interfere with the ideal fiscal picture: controls on minimum housing cost, minimum housing size, and minimum lot size. Related techniques include prohibitions on mobile homes and on multifamily housing.</p>
<p id="e1564676-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>The basis of the</i> Mount Laurel <i>decision.</i></b> Notice that <i>Mount Laurel</i> is based on state, not federal, constitutional law. Justice Hall was aware that several decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court made federal constitutional law an uneasy basis for exclusionary zoning claims.</p>
<p id="e1564677-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>The Fair Housing Act.</i></b> As City of Edmonds v. Oxford House on pages 600-604 should suggest, racially discriminatory exclusionary zoning practices violate the federal Fair Housing Act. On the Fair Housing Act generally, see pages 600-605.</p>
<p id="e1564678-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. <i>After</i> Mount Laurel.</b> It appears that the idea behind <i>Mount Laurel</i> was essentially one of deregulation: Remove obstacles that local governments had put in the way of less costly housing and let the market respond. Newly constructed housing, even of modest residences, might be beyond the reach of low-income people, but the increased supply would let used housing trickle down to them at affordable prices.</p>
<p id="e1564679-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Things did not work out quite that way. Communities read the <i>Mount Laurel</i> opinion closely. They saw, for example, that it applied only to “developing” communities. A number of communities claimed that they were not “developing.” Others pleaded that their local ecology was too sensitive to fall fully under <i>Mount Laurel</i>’s dictates. Still others fudged, changing their ordinances in such a way as to create the appearance, but not the reality, of compliance. And a host of questions developed about how a “fair share” within a “region” was to be determined.</p>
<p id="e156467a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The township of Mount Laurel itself was grudging—indeed, less than honest—in complying with the court’s mandate. It rezoned for low-cost housing three small, widely scattered areas (less than .25 percent of its land) suffering from high noise levels and proximity to industrial uses. This new ordinance was struck down as a complete failure to meet the township’s constitutional obligations in Southern Burlington County NAACP v. Township of Mount Laurel, 456 A.2d 390 (N.J. 1983)—popularly known as <i>Mount Laurel II</i>.</p>
<p id="e156467b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Mount Laurel II</i> gave the court a chance to address some of the issues left open in <i>Mount Laurel I</i>. In the eight years between the cases, the court had learned, it said, that without a strong judicial hand there would not be more housing but only paper, process, and litigation. It also learned, or so it seems, that its original idea of deregulation and an unconstrained market was wrong; rather the need was for measures that <i>required</i> the production of low and moderate income housing. So <i>Mount Laurel II</i> held, among other rulings, as follows:</p>
<p id="e156467c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Essentially, <i>every</i> municipality—not just developing ones—must provide a realistic opportunity for decent housing for its poor, except where (as in many urban areas) the poor represent a disproportionately large percentage of the population as compared to the rest of the region. Good-faith attempts on the part of municipalities would be insufficient; each community must provide its fair share, expressed in terms of number of units needed immediately and in the future. It would not be enough for municipalities to remove barriers to low cost construction; they were to undertake affirmative measures and to assist developers in obtaining state and federal aid. Affirmative measures might include inclusionary zoning devices—such <span title="616" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-616">p. 616</span>as altering density limits in exchange for a developer’s commitment to construct certain amounts of low- and moderate-income housing. Zones for mobile homes were to be created if necessary to meet the fair-share obligation. All future <i>Mount Laurel</i> litigation would be assigned to a group of three judges, appointed by the chief justice, a measure intended in part to ease the difficulties of calculating fair shares. Finally, the opinion confirmed a “builder’s remedy” under which the trial court could allow a developer to go forth with a low income project even though the municipality had not granted a permit if the court found that the municipality had not fulfilled its <i>Mount Laurel</i> obligations.</p>
<p id="e1566d8d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“It is difficult to convey adequately the intensity of the public reaction to the <i>Mount Laurel</i> process since 1983,” Professor John Payne reported. Where <i>Mount Laurel I</i> could be ignored because it was ineffective, <i>Mount Laurel II</i> worked, and it stirred up a fire storm. John M. Payne, Rethinking Fair Share: The Judicial Enforcement of Affordable Housing Policies, 16 Real Est. L.J. 20, 22 (1987). Governor Thomas Kean attacked <i>Mount Laurel II</i> as an undesirable intrusion on the home rule principle. Two years later, the New Jersey legislature, responding to the ongoing problem of exclusionary zoning and the controversy provoked by the builder’s remedy, enacted a Fair Housing Act. N.J. Stat. Ann. §§52:27D-301 to 329 (2001). The statute put a moratorium on the builder’s remedy. It also established an administrative agency, the Council on Affordable Housing (COAH), to determine fair-share obligations for each municipality subject to a <i>Mount Laurel</i> obligation. Municipalities that filed satisfactory plans to meet their obligations would receive a “substantive certification” from COAH, protecting them from builder’s remedies for a period of 10 years. Uncertified municipalities were subject to suit under <i>Mount Laurel II</i>. COAH certification decisions could be appealed, but courts were to treat them with deference. New Jersey’s Fair Housing Act was upheld by the New Jersey Supreme Court in Hills Dev. Co. v. Bernards Township, 510 A.2d 621 (N.J. 1986) (known as <i>Mount Laurel III</i>).</p>
<p id="e1566d8e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A particularly interesting feature of the Fair Housing Act provided for regional contribution agreements whereby any suburb might, with Council approval, compensate cities for agreeing to absorb up to half of the suburb’s fair-share obligation. The legislation itself states that the purpose of the transfer option is to make use of the existing housing stock; suburban contributions would make it possible to rehabilitate substandard housing, presumably in the central cities. Regional contribution agreements proved to be quite popular—over 10,000 units were built or renovated after 1986. See State of New Jersey, Department of Community Affairs, COAH: Reports and Quick Facts (2009). In 2008, the New Jersey Legislature amended the Fair Housing Act to eliminate the regional contribution option.</p>

See COAH: Reports and Quick Facts, supra. Some have argued that while the quantity of units built or rehabilitated is small compared to overall need (which is in the 600,000 to 700,000 range <span title="617" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-617">p. 617</span>through 2014), “[s]omething is surely better than nothing.” See Payne, The Paradox of Progress, supra, at 134.

See 82 Stat. 83. Proscription of discrimination based on sex was added in 1974. See Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, §808(b), 88 Stat. 729.

The township originally challenged plaintiffs’ standing to bring this action. The trial court properly held (119 N.J.

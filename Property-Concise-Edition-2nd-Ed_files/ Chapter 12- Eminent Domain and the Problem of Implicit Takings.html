<p id="e15953c4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The clause of the Fifth Amendment quoted above, known as the Takings Clause, concerns the ability of the government, federal, state, and local, to compel transfer of title to property via the exercise of the government’s power of eminent domain. The Takings Clause applies to the federal government directly and applies to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. That the government has the power of eminent domain is, as we shall see, a point long beyond dispute. The language of the Takings Clause imposes constraints, however: the condemnation, as the action is called, must be “for public use” and with “just compensation.”</p>
<p id="e15953c5-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This language limits not only the government’s right literally to take property through the power of eminent domain, but its freedom to regulate property as well. In regulating through zoning or other means, the government might at times be said to have expropriated what it claimed only to control; so too in carrying out the myriad other activities that attend the modern state. Some of the most intractable issues in the jurisprudence of property concern the matter of just when—under what circumstances—such governmental activities should be regarded as takings.</p>

<p id="e1597ada-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Source of and rationales for the eminent domain power</i>. The origins of eminent domain can be traced back to ancient Rome. See Susan Reynolds, Before Eminent Domain 15-16 (2010). English sovereigns enjoyed similar powers. By the time of the American Revolution, the power of the British government to take private property for public uses was well established. <span title="620" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-620">p. 620</span>While never required to do so, the British Parliament has commonly paid compensation in the course of appropriating land for public purposes.</p>
<p id="e1597adb-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Early American practice regarding eminent domain was heavily influenced by the precedent of English experience. The power of government to take private property was recognized, though compensation was hardly universal in colonial times. Gradually, however, statutes came to provide for compensation, and constitutional provisions began to appear in the late 1700s.</p>
<p id="e1597adc-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Various rationales for the taking power have been offered over the years. Early civil law scholars argued that sovereign states had original and absolute ownership of property; individual possession derived from grants from the state and was held subject to an implied reservation that the state might resume its ownership. Another rationale, offered especially by natural law theorists, that eminent domain is an inherent attribute of sovereignty, necessary to the very existence of government. Each of these notions has been reflected to some degree in American law, the last being the most common rationale today.</p>
<p id="e1597add-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A functional justification for the eminent domain power focuses on economic considerations. Specifically, as Judge Richard Posner points out, it functions as “an antimonopoly device.” See Richard A. Posner, Economic Analysis of Law 56 (9th ed. 2014). When governments build large projects such as railroads, pipelines, airports, and the like, they face a strategic problem that, arguably, private developers typically do not. They must acquire very large parcels of land by assembling together smaller parcels from individual landowners. Usually, the location is site-specific—there is no other location that is suitable for the project (usually private developers have alternatives). Each owner of the individual parcels that the government must acquire has a monopoly on that parcel. The government, in turn, is in a monopoly position on the price to be paid to each landowner, creating a classic bilateral monopoly. The result in such situations commonly is a holdout, as one party or both engages in strategic behavior and bargaining goes on endlessly. But the government needs the land for a public use. Eminent domain is the power of the government to force a sale, so that the land can be put to a more valuable use.</p>

<p id="e1597ae0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Fifth Amendment’s mention of “public use” is read to mean that property may be taken <i>only</i> for such uses; the government may not condemn for “private” purposes, however willing it might be to pay compensation for the forced transfer. Quite obviously, then, the reach of the eminent domain power hinges directly on the breadth or narrowness of meaning attached to the term “public use.”</p>

In 2000, the city of New London approved a development plan that, in the words of the Supreme Court of Connecticut, was “projected to create in excess of 1,000 jobs, to increase tax and other revenues, and to revitalize an economically <span title="621" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-621">p. 621</span>distressed city, including its downtown and waterfront areas.” In assembling the land needed for this project, the city’s development agent has purchased property from willing sellers and proposes to use the power of eminent domain to acquire the remainder of the property from unwilling owners in exchange for just compensation. The question presented is whether the city’s proposed disposition of this property qualifies as a “public use” within the meaning of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.</p>
<p id="e1597ae7-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>I.</b></p>
<p id="e159a1f8-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The city of New London (hereinafter City) sits at the junction of the Thames River and the Long Island Sound in southeastern Connecticut. Decades of economic decline led a state agency in 1990 to designate the City a “distressed municipality.” In 1996, the Federal Government closed the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, which had been located in the Fort Trumbull area of the City and had employed over 1,500 people. In 1998, the City’s unemployment rate was nearly double that of the State, and its population of just under 24,000 residents was at its lowest since 1920.</p>
<p id="e159a1f9-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These conditions prompted state and local officials to target New London, and particularly its Fort Trumbull area, for economic revitalization. To this end, respondent New London Development Corporation (NLDC), a private nonprofit entity established some years earlier to assist the City in planning economic development, was reactivated. In January 1998, the State authorized a $5.35 million bond issue to support the NLDC’s planning activities and a $10 million bond issue toward the creation of a Fort Trumbull State Park. In February, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. announced that it would build a $300 million research facility on a site immediately adjacent to Fort Trumbull; local planners hoped that Pfizer would draw new business to the area, thereby serving as a catalyst to the area’s rejuvenation. . . . The Fort Trumbull area is situated on a peninsula that juts into the Thames River. The area comprises approximately 115 privately owned properties, as well as the 32 acres of land formerly occupied by the naval facility (Trumbull State Park now occupies 18 of those 32 acres). The development plan encompasses seven parcels. Parcel 1 is designated for a waterfront conference hotel at the center of a “small urban village” that will include restaurants and shopping. This parcel will also have marinas for both recreational and commercial uses. A pedestrian “riverwalk” will originate here and continue down the coast, connecting the waterfront areas of the development. Parcel 2 will be the site of approximately 80 new residences organized into an urban neighborhood and linked by public walkway to the remainder of the development, including the state park. This parcel also includes space reserved for a new U.S. Coast Guard Museum. Parcel 3, which is located immediately north of the Pfizer facility, will contain at least 90,000 square feet of research and development office space. Parcel 4A is a 2.4-acre site that will be used either to support the adjacent state park, by providing parking or retail services for visitors, or to support the nearby marina. Parcel 4B will include a renovated marina, as well as the final stretch of the riverwalk. Parcels 5, 6, and 7 will provide land for office and retail space, parking, and water-dependent commercial uses.</p>
<p id="e159a1fa-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The NLDC intended the development plan to capitalize on the arrival of the Pfizer facility and the new commerce it was expected to attract. In addition to creating jobs, generating tax revenue, and helping to “build momentum for the revitalization of downtown New London,” the plan was also designed to make the City more attractive and to create leisure and recreational opportunities on the waterfront and in the park. . . . </p>

They claimed, among other things, that the taking of their properties would violate the “public use” restriction in the Fifth Amendment.

It, however, denied petitioners relief as to the properties located in parcel 3 (office space).</p>
<p id="e159a201-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After the Superior Court ruled, both sides took appeals to the Supreme Court of Connecticut. That court held, over a dissent, that all of the City’s proposed takings were valid. It began by upholding the lower court’s determination that the takings were authorized by the State’s municipal development statute. That statute expresses a legislative determination that the taking of land, even developed land, as part of an economic development project is a “public use” and in the “public interest.” Next, relying on cases such as Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229 (1984), and Berman v. Parker, 348 U.S. 26 (1954), the court held that such economic development qualified as a valid public use under both the Federal and State Constitutions. . . . </p>

On the one hand, it has long been accepted that the sovereign may not take the property of <i>A</i> for the sole purpose of transferring it to another private party <i>B</i>, even though <i>A</i> is paid just compensation. On the other hand, it is equally clear that a State may transfer property from one private party to another if future “use by the public” is the purpose of the taking; the condemnation of land for a railroad with common-carrier duties is a familiar example. Neither of these propositions, however, determines the disposition of this case. . . . </p>

Parker, 348 U.S. 26 (1954), this Court upheld a redevelopment plan targeting a blighted area of Washington, D.C., in which most of the housing for the area’s 5,000 inhabitants was beyond repair. Under the plan, the area would be condemned and part of it utilized for the construction of streets, schools, and other public facilities. The remainder of the land would be leased or sold to private parties for the purpose of redevelopment, including the construction of low-cost housing.</p>

Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Douglas refused to evaluate this claim in isolation, deferring instead to the legislative and agency judgment that the area “must be planned as a whole” for the plan to be successful. The Court explained that “community redevelopment programs need not, by force of the Constitution, be on a piecemeal basis—lot by lot, building by building.” The public use underlying the taking was unequivocally affirmed:</p>

Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229 (1984), the Court considered a Hawaii statute whereby fee title was taken from lessors and transferred to lessees (for just compensation) in order to reduce the concentration of land ownership. We unanimously upheld the statute and rejected the Ninth Circuit’s view that it was a naked attempt on the part of the state of Hawaii to take the property of <i>A</i> and transfer it to <i>B</i> solely for <i>B</i>’s private use and benefit. Reaffirming <i>Berman</i>’s deferential approach to legislative judgments in this field, we concluded that the State’s purpose of eliminating the “social and economic evils of a land oligopoly” qualified as a valid public use. Our opinion also rejected the contention that the mere fact that the State immediately transferred the properties to private individuals upon condemnation somehow diminished the public character of the taking. “[I]t is only the taking’s purpose, and not its mechanics,” we explained, that matters in determining public use . . . competition. 467 U.S., at 1015. . . . </p>

The City has carefully formulated an economic development plan that it believes will provide appreciable benefits to the community, including—but by no means limited to—new jobs and increased tax revenue. As with other exercises in urban planning and development, the City is endeavoring to coordinate a variety of commercial, residential, and recreational uses of land, with the hope that they will form a whole greater than the sum of its parts. To effectuate this plan, the City has invoked a state statute that specifically authorizes the use of eminent domain to promote economic development. Given the comprehensive character of the plan, the thorough deliberation that preceded its adoption, and the limited scope of our review, it is appropriate for us, as it was in <i>Berman</i>, to resolve the challenges of the individual owners, not on a piecemeal basis, but rather in light of the entire plan. Because that plan unquestionably serves a public purpose, the takings challenged here satisfy the public use requirement of the Fifth Amendment.</p>

In our cases upholding takings that facilitated agriculture and mining, for example, we emphasized the importance of those industries to the welfare of the States in question; in <i>Berman</i>, we endorsed the purpose of transforming a blighted area into a “well-balanced” community through redevelopment; in <i>Midkiff</i>, we upheld the interest in breaking up a land oligopoly that “created artificial deterrents to the normal functioning of the State’s residential land market.” . . . It would be incongruous to hold that the City’s interest in the economic benefits to be derived from the development of the Fort Trumbull area has less of a public character than any of those other interests. Clearly, there is no basis for exempting economic development from our traditionally broad understanding of public purpose. . . . </p>
<p id="e159c91e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Just as we decline to second-guess the City’s considered judgments about the efficacy of its development plan, we also decline to second-guess the City’s determinations as to what lands it needs to acquire in order to effectuate the project. “It is not for the courts to oversee the choice of the boundary line nor to sit in review on the size of a particular project area. Once the question of the public purpose has been decided, the amount and character of land to be taken for the project and the need for a particular tract to complete the integrated plan rests in the discretion of the legislative branch.” <i>Berman</i>, 348 U.S., at 35-36.</p>
<p id="e159c91f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In affirming the City’s authority to take petitioners’ properties, we do not minimize the hardship that condemnations may entail, notwithstanding the payment of just compensation. We emphasize that nothing in our opinion precludes any State from placing further restrictions on its exercise of the takings power. Indeed, many States already impose “public use” requirements that are stricter than the federal baseline. Some of these requirements have been established as a matter of state constitutional law, while others are expressed in state eminent domain statutes that carefully limit the grounds upon which takings may be exercised. As the submissions of the parties and their amici make clear, the necessity and wisdom of using eminent domain to promote economic development are certainly matters of legitimate public debate. This Court’s authority, however, extends only to determining whether the City’s proposed condemnations are for a “public use” within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment to the Federal Constitution. Because over a century of our case law interpreting that provision dictates an affirmative answer to that question, we may not grant petitioners the relief that they seek.</p>

Justice O’C<span class="epub-small-caps">ONNOR</span> noted three categories of takings that had been held to satisfy the public use requirement in the past: transfers of private property to public ownership, as for a road; transfers to private parties such as common carriers, railroads, and the like, who make the property available for public use; and transfers to private parties as part of a program to serve a public purpose, as in <i>Midkiff</i> and Berman v.

<div class="epub-heading cc-font-xlarge left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="e159f037-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f">Notes and Questions</p></h3></div>
<p id="e159f038-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>The meaning of “public use” after</i> Kelo.</b> In the Supreme Court’s most important pronouncement of the public-use requirement prior to <i>Kelo</i>, Justice O’Connor, writing for the majority, stated that the requirement was “coterminous with the scope of the sovereign’s police powers” and that courts should review exercises of the eminent domain power only to assure that they are “rationally related to a conceivable public purpose.” Hawaii Housing Auth. v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229, 240, 242-243 (1984). Prior to <i>Kelo</i>, courts interpreted that statement to mean that review for public use requires only the most deferential type of rationality review. According to this view, the public-use requirement is met as long as the court can conceive of some legitimate purpose that the legislature might have had in mind and that the taking can rationally be considered to achieve. Is this the same standard that the Court in <i>Kelo</i> adopts, or does the Court adopt a more demanding standard of review?</p>
<p id="e159f039-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>An alternative approach—means versus ends.</i></b> In both <i>Midkiff</i> and <i>Kelo</i>, the Court’s public-use analysis focused on ends. If the ends of the condemnation are sufficiently “public” in one sense or another, the test is passed. However, there is another way to approach the question of public use—in terms of means rather than ends. The idea is to ask whether the power of eminent domain is really necessary to accomplish whatever aim the government has in mind. Professor Merrill has proposed just such a means-oriented approach, suggesting that the question to ask should be “where and how the government should get property, not what it may do with it.” Thomas W. Merrill, The Economics of Public Use, 72 Cornell L. Rev. 61, 67 (1986). Merrill argues that this approach is more judicially manageable than the ends approach. Do you agree?</p>
<span title="627" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-627">p. 627</span>
<p id="e159f03a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Post-</i>Kelo <i>state constitutions/statutes.</i></b> <i>Kelo</i> produced an enormous political backlash, all of it opposed in one way or another to the use of eminent domain for economic development. The responses ranged from amendments to state constitutional prohibitions of the use of eminent domain for “private use” (e.g., New Hampshire) to adjustments in state and local eminent domain procedures.</p>
<p id="e159f03b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>“Just compensation.”</i></b> Courts have held that “just” compensation does not necessarily mean full compensation, but instead <i>market</i> compensation. The reason for the discrepancy between full and market compensation is that relocation costs, sentimental attachments, and other factors lead some owners to value their land more highly than the market rate. Why do courts award market value rather full value (meaning personal value)? The Supreme Court has explained: “Because of serious practical difficulties in assessing the worth an individual places on particular property at a given time, we have recognized the need for a relatively objective working rule.” What are those “practical difficulties”?</p>
<p id="e159f03c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fair-market value means the amount that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller. See United States v. Miller, 317 U.S. 369, 374 (1943). The problem is that in this context the seller is not a willing seller. Courts resolve the problem by using the various techniques that are ordinarily used to appraise the value of real estate, whether for tax purposes, listing a home for sale, or other purposes. These techniques include the following: (1) look at recent sale prices, if any, for the property in question; (2) look at recent sale prices of “comparables,” i.e., other properties in the area that are considered comparable to the property in question; (3) use the capital value of the actual or potential rental value of the property in question; and (4) use the rebuilding cost of the building in question discounted on the basis of its age and wear and tear.</p>
<p id="e15a174d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The law of just compensation is quite complex. Consider just two of a few of the nice issues that can arise:</p>
<ul class="epub-none">
<li><p id="e15a174e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">→ Suppose that the government condemns part of a tract of land and that the government’s use of that land will reduce the value of the rest of the tract remaining in the condemnee’s hands. How is just compensation computed? See Julius L. Sackman, Nichols on Eminent Domain §8A.02 (3d ed. 2005). Is compensation due if the government’s use does not reduce the value of the condemnee’s remaining land, but does reduce the rate at which it appreciates? See State v. Doyle, 735 P.2d 733 (Alaska 1987).</p></li>
<li><p id="e15a174f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">→ May a city downzone property, restricting its permissible uses, so as to be liable in a subsequent condemnation action only for fair-market value in light of the restrictive zoning? See Riggs v. Township of Long Beach, 538 A.2d 808 (N.J. 1988).</p></li>

<p id="e15a1752-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a straightforward condemnation action, there is no question that the government is taking property; taking is the admitted purpose of the action. But, as you will see below, a long line of Supreme Court decisions hold that takings can also arise from other governmental activities, notwithstanding the government’s <span title="628" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-628">p. 628</span>insistence that no taking has occurred. An example would be a government regulation that requires the destruction of all specimens of a particular species of tree that are or might become infected with a certain infectious disease, and any such tree located within a certain radius of an apple orchard. The ostensible purpose of the statute is to prevent a public nuisance. A landowner with over 200 of these trees must cut them down, as a consequence of which the value of his land has declined very substantially. Has there been a taking, for which compensation must be paid?</p>
<p id="e15a1753-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The key issue in cases such as this is <i>whether</i> a taking has occurred in consequence of the governmental action, and the doctrine that deals with the issue is conventionally referred to, even by the Supreme Court, as the law of “regulatory takings.” But that label is misleading. Many so-called regulatory takings have nothing whatsoever to do with regulation, and regulation is not treated as a distinctive category of activity in Supreme Court opinions. Takings by government regulation are just one member—albeit a substantial member—of a general class of all takings that arise outside the context of explicit takings by condemnation.  We refer to this class as <i>implicit</i> takings. See James E. Krier &amp; Stewart E. Sterk, An Empirical Study of Implicit Takings, 58 Wm. &amp; Mary L. Rev. 35 (2016). Generally speaking, implicit takings arise when government action of any sort, regulatory or not, so restricts the use or enjoyment of private property that it is the functional equivalent of an explicit expropriation.  We say “generally” because there are exceptions and complications, such that the problem of determining when there has been a compensable implicit taking, and when not, is one of the most controversial and nagging topics in all of property law. The first case we shall study, Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, is generally considered to be the origin of implicit takings doctrine, and the Court’s approach in that case is still relevant today.</p>

This is a bill in equity brought by the defendants in error to prevent the Pennsylvania Coal Company from mining under their property in such way as to remove the supports and cause a subsidence of the surface and of their house. The bill sets out a deed executed by the Coal Company in 1878, under which the plaintiffs claim. The deed conveys the surface, but in express terms reserves the right to remove all the coal under the same, and the grantee takes the premises with the risk, and waives all claim for damages that may arise from mining out the coal. But the plaintiffs say that whatever may have been the Coal Company’s rights, they were taken away by an Act of Pennsylvania, approved May 27, 1921, P.L. 1198, commonly known there as the Kohler Act. The Court of Common Pleas found that if not restrained the defendant would cause the damage to prevent which the bill was brought, but denied an injunction, holding that the statute if applied to this case would be unconstitutional. On appeal the Supreme Court of the State agreed that the defendant had contract and property rights protected by the Constitution of the United States, but held that the statute was a legitimate exercise of the police power and directed a decree for the plaintiffs. A writ of error was granted bringing the case to this Court.</p>
<span title="629" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-629">p. 629</span>
<p id="e15a3e6c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statute forbids the mining of anthracite coal in such way as to cause the subsidence of, among other things, any structure used as a human habitation, with certain exceptions, including among them land where the surface is owned by the owner of the underlying coal and is distant more than one hundred and fifty feet from any improved property belonging to any other person. As applied to this case the statute is admitted to destroy previously existing rights of property and contract. The question is whether the police power can be stretched so far.</p>
<p id="e15a3e6d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Government hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law. As long recognized, some values are enjoyed under an implied limitation and must yield to the police power. But obviously the implied limitation must have its limits, or the contract and due process clauses are gone. One fact for consideration in determining such limits is the extent of the diminution. When it reaches a certain magnitude, in most if not in all cases there must be an exercise of eminent domain and compensation to sustain the act. So the question depends upon the particular facts. The greatest weight is given to the judgment of the legislature, but it always is open to interested parties to contend that the legislature has gone beyond its constitutional power.</p>
<p id="e15a3e6e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is the case of a single private house. No doubt there is a public interest even in this, as there is in every purchase and sale and in all that happens within the commonwealth. Some existing rights may be modified even in such a case. Rideout v. Knox, 148 Mass. 368. But usually in ordinary private affairs the public interest does not warrant much of this kind of interference. A source of damage to such a house is not a public nuisance even if similar damage is inflicted on others in different places. The damage is not common or public. Wesson v. Washburn Iron Co., 13 Allen 95, 103. The extent of the public interest is shown by the statute to be limited, since the statute ordinarily does not apply to land when the surface is owned by the owner of the coal. Furthermore, it is not justified as a protection of personal safety. That could be provided for by notice. Indeed the very foundation of this bill is that the defendant gave timely notice of its intent to mine under the house. On the other hand the extent of the taking is great. It purports to abolish what is recognized in Pennsylvania as an estate in land—a very valuable estate—and what is declared by the court below to be a contract hitherto binding the plaintiffs. If we were called upon to deal with the plaintiffs’ position alone, we should think it clear that the statute does not disclose a public interest sufficient to warrant so extensive a destruction of the defendant’s constitutionally protected rights.</p>
<p id="e15a3e6f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the case has been treated as one in which the general validity of the act should be discussed. The Attorney General of the State, the City of Scranton, and the representatives of other extensive interests were allowed to take part in the argument below and have submitted their contentions here. It seems, therefore, to be our duty to go farther in the statement of our opinion, in order that it may be known at once, and that further suits should not be brought in vain.</p>
<p id="e15a3e70-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is our opinion that the act cannot be sustained as an exercise of the police power, so far as it affects the mining of coal under streets or cities in places where the right to mine such coal has been reserved. As said in a Pennsylvania case, “For practical purposes, the right to coal consists in the right to mine it.” Commonwealth v. Clearview Coal Co., 256 Pa. St. 328, 331. What makes the right to mine coal valuable is that it can be exercised with profit. To make it commercially impracticable to mine certain coal has very nearly the same effect for constitutional purposes as appropriating or destroying it. This we think that we are warranted in assuming that the statute does.</p>

But that was a requirement for the safety of employees invited into the mine, and secured an average reciprocity of advantage that has been recognized as a justification of various laws.</p>
<span title="631" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-631">p. 631</span>
<p id="e15a3e75-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rights of the public in a street purchased or laid out by eminent domain are those that it has paid for. If in any case its representatives have been so short sighted as to acquire only surface rights without the right of support, we see no more authority for supplying the latter without compensation than there was for taking the right of way in the first place and refusing to pay for it because the public wanted it very much. The protection of private property in the Fifth Amendment presupposes that it is wanted for public use, but provides that it shall not be taken for such use without compensation. A similar assumption is made in the decisions upon the Fourteenth Amendment. Hairston v. Danville &amp; Western Ry. Co., 208 U.S. 598, 605. When the seemingly absolute protection is found to be qualified by the police power, the natural tendency of human nature is to extend the qualification more and more until at last private property disappears. But that cannot be accomplished in this way under the Constitution of the United States.</p>
<p id="e15a3e76-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The general rule at least is, that while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking. It may be doubted how far exceptional cases, like the blowing up of a house to stop a conflagration, go—and if they go beyond the general rule, whether they do not stand as much upon tradition as upon principle. Bowditch v. Boston, 101 U.S. 16. In general it is not plain that a man’s misfortunes or necessities will justify his shifting the damages to his neighbor’s shoulders. Space v. Lynn &amp; Boston R.R. Co., 172 Mass. 488, 489. We are in danger of forgetting that a strong public desire to improve the public condition is not enough to warrant achieving the desire by a shorter cut than the constitutional way of paying for the change. As we already have said, this is a question of degree—and therefore cannot be disposed of by general propositions. But we regard this as going beyond any of the cases decided by this Court. The late decisions upon laws dealing with the congestion of Washington and New York, caused by the war, dealt with laws intended to meet a temporary emergency and providing for compensation determined to be reasonable by an impartial board. They went to the verge of the law but fell far short of the present act. Block v. Hirsh, 256 U.S. 135. Marcus Brown Holding Co. v. Feldman, 256 U.S. 170. Levy Leasing Co. v. Siegel, 258 U.S. 242.</p>
<p id="e15a3e77-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We assume, of course, that the statute was passed upon the conviction that an exigency existed that would warrant it, and we assume that an exigency exists that would warrant the exercise of eminent domain. But the question at bottom is upon whom the loss of the changes desired should fall. So far as private persons or communities have seen fit to take the risk of acquiring only surface rights, we cannot see that the fact that their risk has become a danger warrants the giving to them greater rights than they bought.</p>

The Kohler Act prohibits, under certain conditions, the mining of anthracite coal within the limits of a city in such a manner or to such an extent “as to cause the . . . subsidence of any dwelling or other structure used as a human habitation, or any factory, store, or other industrial or mercantile establishment in which human labor is employed.” Coal in place is land; and the right of the owner to use his land is not absolute. He may not so use it as to create a public nuisance; and uses, once harmless, may, owing to changed conditions, seriously threaten the public welfare. Whenever they do, the legislature has power to prohibit such uses without paying compensation; and the power to prohibit extends alike to the manner, the character and the purpose of the use. Are we justified in declaring that the Legislature of Pennsylvania has, in restricting the right to mine anthracite, exercised this power so arbitrarily as to violate the Fourteenth Amendment?</p>

<p id="e15a3e7a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Every restriction upon the use of property imposed in the exercise of the police power deprives the owner of some right theretofore enjoyed, and is, in that sense, an abridgement by the State of rights in property without making compensation. But restriction imposed to protect the public health, safety or morals from dangers threatened is not a taking. The restriction here in question is merely the prohibition of a noxious use. The property so restricted remains in the possession of its owner. The State does not appropriate it or make any use of it. The State merely prevents the owner from making a use which interferes with paramount rights of the public. Whenever the use prohibited ceases to be noxious—as it may because of further change in local or social conditions—the restriction will have to be removed and the owner will again be free to enjoy his property as heretofore.</p>
<p id="e15a3e7b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The restriction upon the use of this property can not, of course, be lawfully imposed, unless its purpose is to protect the public. But the purpose of a restriction does not cease to be public, because incidentally some private persons may thereby receive gratuitously valuable special benefits. Thus, owners of low buildings may obtain, through statutory restrictions upon the height of neighboring structures, benefits equivalent to an easement of light and air. Furthermore, a restriction, though imposed for a public purpose, will not be lawful, unless the restriction is an appropriate means to the public end. But to keep coal in place is surely an appropriate means of preventing subsidence of the surface; and ordinarily it is the only available means. Restriction upon use does not become inappropriate as a means, merely because it deprives the owner of the only use to which the property can then be profitably put. The liquor and the oleomargarine cases settled that. Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623; Powell v. Pennsylvania, 127 U.S. 678. Nor is a restriction imposed through exercise of the police power inappropriate as a means, merely because the same end might be effected through exercise of the power of eminent domain, or otherwise at public expense. Every restriction upon the height of buildings might be secured through acquiring by eminent domain the right of each owner to build above the limiting height; but it is settled that the State need not resort to that power. If by mining anthracite coal the owner would necessarily unloose poisonous gasses, I suppose no one would doubt the power of the State to prevent the mining, without buying his coal fields. And why may not the State, likewise, without paying compensation, prohibit one from digging so deep or excavating so near the surface, as to expose the community to like dangers? In the latter case, as in the former, carrying on the business would be a public nuisance.</p>
<p id="e15a658c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is said that one fact for consideration in determining whether the limits of the police power have been exceeded is the extent of the resulting diminution in value; and that here the restriction destroys existing rights of property and contract. But values are relative. If we are to consider the value of the coal kept in place by the restriction, we should compare it with the value of all other parts of the land. That is, with the value not of the coal alone, but with the value of the whole property. The rights of an owner as against the public are not increased by dividing the interests in his property into surface and subsoil. The sum of the rights in the parts can not be greater than the rights in the whole. The estate of an owner in land is grandiloquently described as extending <i>ab orco usque ad coelum.</i> But I suppose no one would contend that by selling his interest above one hundred feet from the surface he could prevent the State from limiting, by the police power, the height of structures in a city. And why should a sale of underground rights bar the State’s power? For aught that appears the value of the coal kept in place by the restriction may be negligible as compared with the value of the whole property,</p>

Ordinarily a police regulation, general in operation, will not be held void as to a particular property, although proof is offered that owing to conditions peculiar to it the restriction could not reasonably be applied. But even if the particular facts are to govern, the statute should, in my opinion, <span title="634" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-634">p. 634</span>be upheld in this case. For the defendant has failed to adduce any evidence from which it appears that to restrict its mining operations was an unreasonable exercise of the police power. Where the surface and the coal belong to the same person, self-interest would ordinarily prevent mining to such an extent as to cause a subsidence. It was, doubtless, for this reason that the legislature, estimating the degrees of danger, deemed statutory restriction unnecessary for the public safety under such conditions.</p>
<p id="e15a6591-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is said that this is a case of a single dwelling house; that the restriction upon mining abolishes a valuable estate hitherto secured by a contract with the plaintiffs; and that the restriction upon mining cannot be justified as a protection of personal safety, since that could be provided for by notice. The propriety of deferring a good deal to tribunals on the spot has been repeatedly recognized. . . . May we say that notice would afford adequate protection of the public safety where the legislature and the highest court of the State, with greater knowledge of local conditions, have declared, in effect, that it would not? If public safety is imperiled, surely neither grant, nor contract, can prevail against the exercise of the police power. . . . </p>

But the Kohler Act contains provisions in addition to that quoted above; and as to these, also, an opinion is expressed. These provisions deal with mining under cities to such an extent as to cause subsidence of—</p>

Yet it is said that these provisions of the act cannot be sustained as an exercise of the police power where the right to mine such coal has been reserved. The conclusion seems to rest upon the assumption that in order to justify such exercise of the police power there must be “an average reciprocity of advantage” as between the owner of the property restricted and the rest of the community; and that here such reciprocity is absent. Reciprocity of advantage is an important consideration, and may even be an essential, where the State’s power is exercised for the purpose of conferring benefits upon the property of a neighborhood, as in drainage projects, Wurts v. Hoagland, 114 U.S. 606; Fallbrook Irrigation District v. Bradley, 164 U.S. 112; or upon adjoining owners, as by party wall provisions, Jackman v. Rosenbaum Co., [260 U.S.] 22. But where the police power is exercised, not to confer benefits upon property owners, but to protect the public from detriment and danger, there is, in my opinion, no room for considering reciprocity of advantage. There was no reciprocal advantage to the owner prohibited from using his oil tanks in 248 U.S. 498; his brickyard, in 239 U.S. 394; his livery stable, in 237 U.S. 171; his billiard hall, in 225 U.S. 623; his oleomargarine factory, in 127 U.S. 678; his brewery, in 123 U.S. 623; unless it be the advantage of living and doing business in a civilized community. That reciprocal advantage is given by the act to the coal operators.</p>

<p id="e15a6599-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The decision in <i>Pennsylvania Coal</i> turns out not to have had much impact on the coal companies’ behavior. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision anthracite mining companies in eastern Pennsylvania generally compensated surface owners for any damage caused by subsidence, even if the owner had waived the support right. What made the Kohler Act objectionable to coal companies was its remedy of private injunctions. Another state statute, the Fowler Act, was connected with this feature in a curious way. The Fowler Act taxed coal companies on all anthracite coal, which they mined throughout the state, but coal companies did not have to pay the tax unless they wanted relief from obligations imposed on them under the Kohler Act. In <i>Pennsylvania Coal</i>, Mahon had sought an injunction against the coal company to prevent mining under his land. The Court’s decision freed the companies from the tax under the Fowler Act, but apparently it did not change their practice of voluntarily compensating surface owners for damage caused by subsidence. Why do you suppose the companies paid that compensation? This information and a fascinating account of the background of the case is provided in William A. Fischel, Regulatory Takings: Law, Economics, and Politics 25-47 (1995).</p>

<p id="e15a8cac-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Takings tests.</i></b> As we noted previously, <i>Pennsylvania Coal</i> is still a very important case. It is the source of the idea that regulations may “go too far” and therefore cross the line between non-compensable regulations (exercises of the police power) and compensable takings (exercises of the eminent domain power). This is the idea behind the regulatory taking doctrine. The question is how to determine when a regulation crosses that line. Justice Holmes’s opinion did not give us much guidance, but it did guide us some.</p>
<p id="e15a8cad-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">His test says, in essence, that when governmental regulation of a use that is not a nuisance imposes too great a burden on property owners, it cannot go forth without compensation. Notice, though, that the regulation itself might provide implicit compensation by way of what Justice Holmes called, on page 630, “an average reciprocity of advantage.” The idea, of course, is that the apparent losers under a government program might not be losers at all (or not, at least, big losers) because they are simultaneously benefited by the very action that burdens them. Watch for this idea as it plays into later cases.</p>
<p id="e15a8cae-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For a general assessment of <i>Pennsylvania Coal</i>’s significance, see William Michael Treanor, Jam for Justice Holmes: Reassessing the Significance of <i>Mahon</i>, 86 Geo. L.J. 813 (1998).</p>

He attacks the diminution-in-value test head on: diminution relative to what? The diminution-in-value test is extraordinarily ambiguous. How much of a loss of value is too much? Is loss to be measured in absolute terms, or rather in relative ones? If the latter, relative to what?</p>

<p id="e15a8cb1-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Conceptual severance.</i></b> Consider how Holmes and Brandeis differed in their approach to the last question in particular. Pennsylvania law recognizes three separate estates in mining property: in the surface, in the minerals, and in support of the surface. Holmes saw the Kohler Act as purporting to “abolish” the third estate entirely. See page 629. Brandeis, on the other hand, reasoned that the “rights of an owner as against the public are not increased by dividing the interests in his property”; the Kohler Act did not take all of a smaller thing (the third estate), but only a part “of the whole property.” See page 632.</p>
<p id="e15a8cb2-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Which view is correct? The approach reflected in Holmes’s view is referred to in the literature as <i>conceptual severance</i>, a term whose origin is an article by Professor Margaret Jane Radin, The Liberal Conception of Property: Cross Currents in the Jurisprudence of Takings, 88 Colum. L. Rev. 1667, 1676 (1988). The Supreme Court has not definitively stated its position on the use of conceptual severance for all purposes.</p>
<p id="e15a8cb3-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider, for example, Keystone Bituminous Coal Association v. DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470 (1987), a case that might rightly be called <i>Pennsylvania Coal</i> redux. The case arose out of a 1966 Pennsylvania statute designed, as was the Kohler Act involved in <i>Pennsylvania Coal</i>, to control subsidence from coal mining. Under the legislation, coal companies had to keep up to 50 percent of their coal in place, and repair subsidence damage even if surface owners had waived their rights. The Court held that the statute did not work a taking, despite its similarities to the Kohler Act, because its purpose was not just to balance private economic interests, but rather to protect the public interest in health, environmental quality, and fiscal integrity. In any event, the Court held, the coal companies had not shown a sufficient diminution in value, a point related to the matter of conceptual severance. The millions of tons of coal that had to remain in place under the Pennsylvania statute were not a separate segment of property, but only a low percent of the total coal owned by the companies. Never mind that Pennsylvania law recognized the “support estate” as a separate interest; “our takings jurisprudence forecloses reliance on such legalistic distinctions within a bundle of property rights.” 480 U.S. at 500.</p>
<p id="e15a8cb4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chief Justice Rehnquist, joined by Justices Powell, O’Connor, and Scalia, dissented. In their view, the majority in <i>Keystone</i> had wrongly discounted <i>Pennsylvania Coal</i>, “the foundation of our ‘regulatory takings’ jurisprudence.” 480 U.S. at 508.</p>

<p id="e15ab3ce-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Over the past 50 years, all 50 States and over 500 municipalities have enacted laws to encourage or require the preservation of buildings and areas with historic or aesthetic importance. These nationwide legislative efforts have been precipitated by two concerns. The first is recognition that, in recent years, large numbers of historic structures, landmarks, and areas have been destroyed without adequate consideration of either the values represented therein or the possibility of preserving the destroyed properties for use in economically productive ways. The second is a widely shared belief that structures with special historic, cultural, or architectural significance enhance the quality of life for all. Not only do these buildings and their workmanship represent the lessons of the past and embody precious features of our heritage, they serve as examples of quality for today. . . . </p>
<p id="e15ab3cf-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">New York City, responding to similar concerns and acting pursuant to a New York State enabling Act, adopted its Landmarks Preservation Law in 1965. See N.Y.C. Admin. Code, ch. 8-A, §205-1.0 et seq. (1976). The city acted from the conviction that “the standing of [New York City] as a world-wide tourist center and world capital of business, culture and government” would be threatened if legislation were not enacted to protect historic landmarks and neighborhoods from precipitate decisions to destroy or fundamentally alter their character. . . . </p>
<p id="e15ab3d0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The New York City law is typical of many urban landmark laws in that its primary method of achieving its goals is not by acquisitions of historic properties, but rather by involving public entities in land-use decisions affecting these properties and providing services, standards, controls, and incentives that will encourage preservation by private owners and users. While the law does place special restrictions on landmark properties as a necessary feature to the attainment of its larger objectives, the major theme of the law is to ensure the owners of any such properties both a “reasonable return” on their investments and maximum latitude to use their parcels for purposes not inconsistent with the preservation goals. . . . </p>

First, the law imposes a duty upon the owner to keep the exterior features of the building “in good repair” to assure that the law’s objectives not be defeated by the landmark’s falling into a state of irremediable disrepair. Second, the Commission must approve in advance any proposal to alter the exterior architectural features of the landmark or to construct any exterior improvement on the landmark site, thus ensuring that decisions concerning construction on the landmark site are made with due consideration of both the public interest in the maintenance of the structure and the landowner’s interest in use of the property. . . . </p>
<p id="e15ab3d8-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the designation of a landmark and landmark site restricts the owner’s control over the parcel, designation also enhances the economic position of the landmark owner in one significant respect. Under New York City’s zoning laws, owners of real property who have not developed their property to the full extent permitted by the applicable zoning laws are allowed to transfer development rights to contiguous <span title="639" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-639">p. 639</span>parcels on the same city block. See New York City, Zoning Resolution Art. I, ch. 2, §12-10 (1978) (definition of “zoning lot”). A 1968 ordinance gave the owners of landmark sites additional opportunities to transfer development rights to other parcels. Subject to a restriction that the floor area of the transferee lot may not be increased by more than 20% above its authorized level, the ordinance permitted transfers from a landmark parcel to property across the street or across a street intersection. In 1969, the law governing the conditions under which transfers from landmark parcels could occur was liberalized, see New York City Zoning Resolutions 74-79 to 74-793, apparently to ensure that the Landmarks Law would not unduly restrict the development options of the owners of Grand Central Terminal. See Marcus, Air Rights Transfers in New York City, 36 Law &amp; Contemp. Prob. 372, 375 (1971). The class of recipient lots was expanded to include lots “across a street and opposite to another lot or lots which except for the intervention of streets or street intersections f[or]m a series extending to the lot occupied by the landmark building[, provided that] all lots [are] in the same ownership.” New York City Zoning Resolution 74-79 (emphasis deleted). In addition, the 1969 amendment permits, in highly commercialized areas like midtown Manhattan, the transfer of all unused development rights to a single parcel.</p>

Opened in 1913, it is regarded not only as providing an ingenious engineering solution to the problems presented by urban railroad stations, but also as a magnificent example of the French beaux-arts style.</p>
<p id="e15ab3db-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Terminal is located in midtown Manhattan. Its south facade faces 42d Street and that street’s intersection with Park Avenue. At street level, the Terminal is bounded on the west by Vanderbilt Avenue, on the east by the Commodore Hotel, and on the north by the Pan-American Building. Although a 20-story office tower, to have been located above the Terminal, was part of the original design, the planned tower was never constructed. The Terminal itself is an eight-story structure which Penn Central uses as a railroad station and in which it rents space not needed for railroad purposes to a variety of commercial interests. The Terminal is one of a number of properties owned by appellant Penn Central in this area of midtown Manhattan. The others include the Barclay, Biltmore, Commodore, Roosevelt, and Waldorf-Astoria Hotels, the Pan-American Building and other office buildings along Park Avenue, and the Yale Club. At least eight of these are eligible to be recipients of development rights afforded the Terminal by virtue of landmark designation.</p>
<p id="e15ab3dc-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On August 2, 1967, following a public hearing, the Commission designated the Terminal a “landmark” and designated the “city tax block” it occupies a “landmark site.” The Board of Estimate confirmed this action on September 21, 1967. Although appellant Penn Central had opposed the designation before the Commission, it did not seek judicial review of the final designation decision.</p>
<p id="e15ab3dd-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On January 22, 1968, appellant Penn Central, to increase its income, entered into a renewable 50-year lease and sublease agreement with appellant UGP Properties, Inc. (UGP), a wholly owned subsidiary of Union General Properties, Ltd., a United Kingdom corporation. Under the terms of the agreement, UGP was to construct a multistory office building above the Terminal. UGP promised to pay Penn Central $1 million annually during construction and at least $3 million annually thereafter. The rentals <span title="640" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-640">p. 640</span>would be offset in part by a loss of some $700,000 to $1 million in net rentals presently received from concessionaires displaced by the new building.</p>
<p id="e15ab3de-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants UGP and Penn Central then applied to the Commission for permission to construct an office building atop the Terminal. Two separate plans, both designed by architect Marcel Breuer and both apparently satisfying the terms of the applicable zoning ordinance, were submitted to the Commission for approval. The first, Breuer I, provided for the construction of a 55-story office building, to be cantilevered above the existing facade and to rest on the roof of the Terminal. The second, Breuer II Revised, called for tearing down a portion of the Terminal that included the 42d Street facade, stripping off some of the remaining features of the Terminal’s facade, and constructing a 53-story office building. The Commission denied a certificate of no exterior effect on September 20, 1968. Appellants then applied for a certificate of “appropriateness” as to both proposals. After four days of hearings at which over 80 witnesses testified, the Commission denied this application as to both proposals.</p>
<p id="e15adaef-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Commission’s reasons for rejecting certificates respecting Breuer II Revised are summarized in the following statement: “To protect a Landmark, one does not tear it down. To perpetuate its architectural features, one does not strip them off.” Breuer I, which would have preserved the existing vertical facades of the present structure, received more sympathetic consideration. The Commission first focused on the effect that the proposed tower would have on one desirable feature created by the present structure and its surroundings: the dramatic view of the Terminal from Park Avenue South. Although appellants had contended that the Pan-American Building had already destroyed the silhouette of the south facade and that one additional tower could do no further damage and might even provide a better background for the facade, the Commission disagreed, stating that it found the majestic approach from the south to be still unique in the city and that a 55-story tower atop the Terminal would be far more detrimental to its south facade than the Pan-American Building 375 feet away. Moreover, the Commission found that from closer vantage points the Pan-Am Building and the other towers were largely cut off from view, which would not be the case of the mass on top of the Terminal planned under Breuer I. . . . </p>
<p id="e15adaf0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants did not seek judicial review of the denial of either certificate. . . . Instead, appellants filed suit in New York Supreme Court, Trial Term, claiming, inter alia, that the application of the Landmarks Preservation Law had “taken” their property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and arbitrarily deprived them of their property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Appellants sought a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief barring the city from using the Landmarks Law to impede the construction of any structure that might otherwise lawfully be constructed on the Terminal site, and damages for the “temporary taking” that occurred between August 2, 1967, the designation date, and the date when the restrictions arising from the Landmarks Law would be lifted. The trial court granted the injunctive and declaratory relief, but severed the question of damages for a “temporary taking.”</p>

<p id="e15adafb-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issues presented by appellants are (1) whether the restrictions imposed by New York City’s law upon appellants’ exploitation of the Terminal site effect a “taking” of appellants’ property for a public use within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment, which of course is made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, see Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U.S. 226, 239 (1897), and, (2), if so, whether the transferable development rights afforded appellants constitute “just compensation” within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. We need only address the question whether a “taking” has occurred.</p>
<p id="e15adafc-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>A</i></p>
<p id="e15adafd-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before considering appellants’ specific contentions, it will be useful to review the factors that have shaped the jurisprudence of the Fifth Amendment injunction “nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.” The question of what constitutes a “taking” for purposes of the Fifth Amendment has proved to be a problem of considerable difficulty. While this Court has recognized that the “Fifth Amendment’s guarantee . . . [is] designed to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole,” Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S. 40, 49 (1960), this Court, quite simply, has been unable to develop any “set formula” for determining when “justice and fairness” require that economic injuries caused by public action be compensated by the government, rather than remain disproportionately concentrated on a few persons. See Goldblatt v. Hempstead, 369 U.S. 590, 594 (1962). Indeed, we have frequently observed that whether a particular restriction will be rendered invalid by the government’s failure to pay for any losses proximately caused by it depends largely “upon the particular circumstances [in that] case.” United States v. Central Eureka Mining Co., 357 U.S. 155, 168 (1958).</p>
<p id="e15adafe-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In engaging in these essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries, the Court’s decisions have identified several factors that have particular significance. The economic impact of the regulation on the claimant and, particularly, the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations are, of course, relevant considerations. So, too, is the character of the governmental action. A “taking” may more readily be found when the interference with property can be characterized as a physical invasion by government, see, e.g., United States v. Causby, 328 U.S. 256 (1946), than when interference arises from some public program adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good.</p>
<p id="e15adaff-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Government hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law,” Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393, 413 (1922), and this Court has accordingly recognized, in a wide variety of contexts, that government may execute laws or programs that adversely affect recognized economic values. Exercises of the taxing power are one obvious example. A second are the decisions in which this Court has dismissed “taking” challenges on the ground that, while the challenged government <span title="644" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-644">p. 644</span>action caused economic harm, it did not interfere with interests that were sufficiently bound up with the reasonable expectations of the claimant to constitute “property” for Fifth Amendment purposes. See, e.g., United States v. Willow River Power Co., 324 U.S. 499 (1945) (interest in high-water level of river for runoff for tailwaters to maintain power head is not property); United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Water Power Co., 229 U.S. 53 (1913) (no property interest can exist in navigable waters).</p>
<p id="e15adb00-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More importantly for the present case, in instances in which a state tribunal reasonably concluded that “the health, safety, morals, or general welfare” would be promoted by prohibiting particular contemplated uses of land, this Court has upheld land-use regulations that destroyed or adversely affected recognized real property interests. See Nectow v. Cambridge, 277 U.S. 183, 188 (1928). Zoning laws are, of course, the classic example, see Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365 (1926) (prohibition of industrial use). . . . </p>
<p id="e15adb01-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>B</i></p>
<p id="e15adb02-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In contending that the New York City law has “taken” their property in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, appellants make a series of arguments, which, while tailored to the facts of this case, essentially urge that any substantial restriction imposed pursuant to a landmark law must be accompanied by just compensation if it is to be constitutional. . . . </p>
<p id="e15adb03-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Appellants] first observe that the airspace above the Terminal is a valuable property interest, citing United States v. Causby, supra. They urge that the Landmarks Law has deprived them of any gainful use of their “air rights” above the Terminal and that, irrespective of the value of the remainder of their parcel, the city has “taken” their right to this superadjacent airspace, thus entitling them to “just compensation” measured by the fair market value of these air rights.</p>
<p id="e15adb04-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Apart from our own disagreement with appellants’ characterization of the effect of the New York City law, . . . the submission that appellants may establish a “taking” simply by showing that they have been denied the ability to exploit a property interest that they heretofore had believed was available for development is quite simply untenable. . . . “Taking” jurisprudence does not divide a single parcel into discrete segments and attempt to determine whether rights in a particular segment have been entirely abrogated. In deciding whether a particular governmental action has effected a taking, this Court focuses rather both on the character of the action and on the nature and extent of the interference with rights in the parcel as a whole—here, the city tax block designated as the “landmark site.”</p>
<p id="e15adb05-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Secondly, appellants, focusing on the character and impact of the New York City law, argue that it effects a “taking” because its operation has significantly diminished the value of the Terminal site. Appellants concede that the decisions sustaining other land-use regulations, which, like the New York City law, are reasonably related to the promotion of the general welfare, uniformly reject the proposition that diminution in property value, standing alone, can establish a “taking,” see Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365 (1926) (75% diminution in value caused by zoning law); Hadacheck v. Sebastian, 239 U.S. 394 (1915) (87 1/2% diminution in value), and that the “taking” issue in these contexts is resolved by focusing on the uses the regulations permit. Appellants, moreover, also do not dispute that a showing of diminution in property value would not establish a taking if the restriction had been imposed as a result of historic-district legislation, but appellants argue that New York City’s regulation of individual landmarks is fundamentally different from zoning or from historic-district <span title="645" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-645">p. 645</span>legislation because the controls imposed by New York City’s law apply only to individuals who own selected properties. . . . </p>
<p id="e15b0116-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is true, as appellants emphasize, that both historic-district legislation and zoning laws regulate all properties within given physical communities whereas landmark laws apply only to selected parcels. But, contrary to appellants’ suggestions, landmark laws are not like discriminatory, or “reverse spot,” zoning: that is, a land-use decision which arbitrarily singles out a particular parcel for different, less favorable treatment than the neighboring ones. In contrast to discriminatory zoning, which is the antithesis of land-use control as part of some comprehensive plan, the New York City law embodies a comprehensive plan to preserve structures of historic or aesthetic interest wherever they might be found in the city, and as noted, over 400 landmarks and 31 historic districts have been designated pursuant to this plan. . . . </p>
<p id="e15b0117-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Next, appellants observe that New York City’s law differs from zoning laws and historic-district ordinances in that the Landmarks Law does not impose identical or similar restrictions on all structures located in particular physical communities. It follows, they argue, that New York City’s law is inherently incapable of producing the fair and equitable distribution of benefits and burdens of governmental action which is characteristic of zoning laws and historic-district legislation and which they maintain is a constitutional requirement if “just compensation” is not to be afforded. It is, of course, true that the Landmarks Law has a more severe impact on some landowners than on others, but that in itself does not mean that the law effects a “taking.” Legislation designed to promote the general welfare commonly burdens some more than others. The owners of the brickyard in <i>Hadacheck</i>, of the cedar trees in Miller v. Schoene, [276 U.S. 272 (1928),] and of the gravel and sand mine in Goldblatt v. Hempstead, were uniquely burdened by the legislation sustained in those cases. Similarly, zoning laws often affect some property owners more severely than others but have not been held to be invalid on that account. For example, the property owner in <i>Euclid</i> who wished to use its property for industrial purposes was affected far more severely by the ordinance than its neighbors who wished to use their land for residences.</p>
<p id="e15b0118-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In any event, appellants’ repeated suggestions that they are solely burdened and unbenefited is factually inaccurate. This contention overlooks the fact that the New York City law applies to vast numbers of structures in the city in addition to the Terminal—all the structures contained in the 31 historic districts and over 400 individual landmarks, many of which are close to the Terminal. . . . </p>
<p id="e15b0119-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants’ final broad-based attack would have us treat the law as an instance, like that in United States v. Causby, in which government, acting in an enterprise capacity, has appropriated part of their property for some strictly governmental purpose. Apart from the fact that <i>Causby</i> was a case of invasion of airspace that destroyed the use of the farm beneath and this New York City law has in nowise impaired the present use of the Terminal, the Landmarks Law neither exploits appellants’ parcel for city purposes nor facilitates nor arises from any entrepreneurial operations of the city. The situation is not remotely like that in <i>Causby</i> where the airspace above the property was in the flight pattern for military aircraft. The Landmarks Law’s effect is simply to prohibit appellants or anyone else from occupying portions of the airspace above the Terminal, while permitting appellants to use the remainder of the parcel in a gainful fashion. . . . </p>
<p id="e15b011a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>C</i></p>
<p id="e15b011b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rejection of appellants’ broad arguments is not, however, the end of our inquiry, for all we thus far have established is that the New York City law is not rendered <span title="646" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-646">p. 646</span>invalid by its failure to provide “just compensation” whenever a landmark owner is restricted in the exploitation of property interests, such as air rights, to a greater extent than provided for under applicable zoning laws. We now must consider whether the interference with appellants’ property is of such a magnitude that “there must be an exercise of eminent domain and compensation to sustain [it].” Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S., at 413. That inquiry may be narrowed to the question of the severity of the impact of the law on appellants’ parcel, and its resolution in turn requires a careful assessment of the impact of the regulation on the Terminal site.</p>
<p id="e15b011c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . [T]he New York City law does not interfere in any way with the present uses of the Terminal. Its designation as a landmark not only permits but contemplates that appellants may continue to use the property precisely as it has been used for the past 65 years: as a railroad terminal containing office space and concessions. So the law does not interfere with what must be regarded as Penn Central’s primary expectation concerning the use of the parcel. More importantly, on this record, we must regard the New York City law as permitting Penn Central not only to profit from the Terminal but also to obtain a “reasonable return” on its investment.</p>
<p id="e15b011d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants, moreover, exaggerate the effect of the law on their ability to make use of the air rights above the Terminal in two respects. First, it simply cannot be maintained, on this record, that appellants have been prohibited from occupying <i>any</i> portion of the airspace above the Terminal. While the Commission’s actions in denying applications to construct an office building in excess of 50 stories above the Terminal may indicate that it will refuse to issue a certificate of appropriateness for any comparably sized structure, nothing the Commission has said or done suggests an intention to prohibit <i>any</i> construction above the Terminal. The Commission’s report emphasized that whether any construction would be allowed depended upon whether the proposed addition “would harmonize in scale, material and character with [the Terminal].” Since appellants have not sought approval for the construction of a smaller structure, we do not know that appellants will be denied any use of any portion of the airspace above the Terminal.</p>
<p id="e15b011e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, to the extent appellants have been denied the right to build above the Terminal, it is not literally accurate to say that they have been denied <i>all</i> use of even those pre-existing air rights. Their ability to use these rights has not been abrogated; they are made transferable to at least eight parcels in the vicinity of the Terminal, one or two of which have been found suitable for the construction of new office buildings. Although appellants and others have argued that New York City’s transferable development-rights program is far from ideal, the New York courts here supportably found that, at least in the case of the Terminal, the rights afforded are valuable. While these rights may well not have constituted “just compensation” if a “taking” had occurred, the rights nevertheless undoubtedly mitigate whatever financial burdens the law has imposed on appellants and, for that reason, are to be taken into account in considering the impact of regulation.</p>
<p id="e15b011f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On this record, we conclude that the application of New York City’s Landmarks Law has not effected a “taking” of appellants’ property. The restrictions imposed are substantially related to the promotion of the general welfare and not only permit reasonable beneficial use of the landmark site but also afford appellants opportunities further to enhance not only the Terminal site proper but also other properties.</p>

<p id="e15b0123-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Fifth Amendment provides in part: “nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.” In a very literal sense, the actions of appellees violated this constitutional prohibition. Before the city of New York declared Grand Central Terminal to be a landmark, Penn Central could have used its “air rights” over the Terminal to build a multistory office building, at an apparent value of several million dollars per year. Today, the Terminal cannot be modified in <i>any</i> form, including the erection of additional stories, without the permission of the Landmark Preservation Commission, a permission which appellants, despite good-faith attempts, have so far been unable to obtain. Because the Taking Clause of the Fifth Amendment has not always been read literally, however, the constitutionality of appellees’ actions requires a closer scrutiny of this Court’s interpretation of the three key words in the Taking Clause—“property,” “taken,” and “just compensation.”</p>
<p id="e15b0124-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>A</i></p>
<p id="e15b0125-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellees do not dispute that valuable property rights have been destroyed. And the Court has frequently emphasized that the term “property” as used in the Taking Clause includes the entire “group of rights inhering in the citizen’s [ownership].” United States v. General Motors Corp., 323 U.S. 373 (1945). The term is not used in the vulgar and untechnical sense of the physical thing with respect to which the citizen exercises rights recognized by law. [Instead, it] . . . denote[s] the <i>group of rights</i> inhering in the citizen’s relation to the physical thing, <i>as the right to possess, use and dispose of it</i>. . . . The constitutional provision is addressed to <i>every sort of interest</i> the citizen may possess. Id., at 377-378 (emphasis added). While neighboring landowners are free to use their land and “air rights” in any way consistent with the broad boundaries of New York zoning, Penn Central, absent the permission of appellees, must forever maintain its property in its present state. The property has been thus subjected to a nonconsensual servitude not borne by any neighboring or similar properties.</p>
<p id="e15b0126-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>B</i></p>
<p id="e15b0127-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellees have thus destroyed—in a literal sense, “taken”—substantial property rights of Penn Central. While the term “taken” might have been narrowly interpreted to include only physical seizures of property rights, “the construction of the phrase has not been so narrow. The courts have held that the deprivation of the former owner rather than the accretion of a right or interest to the sovereign constitutes the taking.” Id., at 378. Because “not every destruction or injury to property by governmental action has been held to be a ‘taking’ in the constitutional sense,” Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S., at 48, however, this does not end our inquiry. But an examination of the two exceptions where the destruction of property does <i>not</i> constitute a taking demonstrates that a compensable taking has occurred here.</p>
<p id="e15b0128-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center ">1</p>
<p id="e15b0129-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As early as 1887, the Court recognized that the government can prevent a property owner from using his property to injure others without having to compensate the owner for the value of the forbidden use. . . . </p>
<p id="e15b012a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, there is no “taking” where a city prohibits the operation of a brickyard within a residential area, see Hadacheck v. Sebastian, 239 U.S. 394 (1915), or forbids excavation <span title="648" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-648">p. 648</span>for sand and gravel below the water line, see Goldblatt v. Hempstead, 369 U.S. 590 (1962). Nor is it relevant, where the government is merely prohibiting a noxious use of property, that the government would seem to be singling out a particular property owner.</p>
<p id="e15b012b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The nuisance exception to the taking guarantee is not coterminous with the police power itself. The question is whether the forbidden use is dangerous to the safety, health, or welfare of others. . . . </p>
<p id="e15b012c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellees are not prohibiting a nuisance. The record is clear that the proposed addition to the Grand Central Terminal would be in full compliance with zoning, height limitations, and other health and safety requirements. Instead, appellees are seeking to preserve what they believe to be an outstanding example of beaux-arts architecture. Penn Central is prevented from further developing its property basically because <i>too good</i> a job was done in designing and building it. The city of New York, because of its unadorned admiration for the design, has decided that the owners of the building must preserve it unchanged for the benefit of sightseeing New Yorkers and tourists.</p>
<p id="e15b012d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unlike land-use regulations, appellees’ actions do not merely <i>prohibit</i> Penn Central from using its property in a narrow set of noxious ways. Instead, appellees have placed an <i>affirmative</i> duty on Penn Central to maintain the Terminal in its present state and in “good repair.” Appellants are not free to use their property as they see fit within broad outer boundaries but must strictly adhere to their past use except where appellees conclude that alternative uses would not detract from the landmark. While Penn Central may continue to use the Terminal as it is presently designed, appellees otherwise “exercise complete dominion and control over the surface of the land,” United States v. Causby, 328 U.S. 256, 262 (1946), and must compensate the owner for his loss. Ibid. “Property is taken in the constitutional sense when inroads are made upon an owner’s use of it to an extent that, as between private parties, a servitude has been acquired.” United States v. Dickinson, 331 U.S. 745, 748 (1947).</p>
<p id="e15b012e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center ">2</p>
<p id="e15b012f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even where the government prohibits a noninjurious use, the Court has ruled that a taking does not take place if the prohibition applies over a broad cross section of land and thereby “secure[s] an average reciprocity of advantage.” Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S., at 415. It is for this reason that zoning does not constitute a “taking.” While zoning at times reduces <i>individual</i> property values, the burden is shared relatively evenly and it is reasonable to conclude that on the whole an individual who is harmed by one aspect of the zoning will be benefited by another.</p>
<p id="e15b2840-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, however, a multimillion dollar loss has been imposed on appellants; it is uniquely felt and is not offset by any benefits flowing from the preservation of some 400 other “landmarks” in New York City. Appellees have imposed a substantial cost on less than one one-tenth of one percent of the buildings in New York City for the general benefit of all its people. It is exactly this imposition of general costs on a few individuals at which the “taking” protection is directed. . . . </p>
<p id="e15b2841-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As Mr. Justice Holmes pointed out in Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, “the question at bottom” in an eminent domain case “is upon whom the loss of the changes desired should fall.” 260 U.S., at 416. The benefits that appellees believe will flow from preservation of the Grand Central Terminal will accrue to all the citizens of New York City. There is no reason to believe that appellants will enjoy a substantially greater share of these benefits. If the cost of preserving Grand Central Terminal were spread evenly across the entire population of the city of New York, the burden per person would be in cents per year—a minor cost appellees would surely concede for the benefit accrued. Instead, however, appellees would impose the entire cost of several <span title="649" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-649">p. 649</span>million dollars per year on Penn Central. But it is precisely this sort of discrimination that the Fifth Amendment prohibits. . . . </p>
<p id="e15b2842-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>C</i></p>
<p id="e15b2843-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellees, apparently recognizing that the constraints imposed on a landmark site constitute a taking for Fifth Amendment purposes, do not leave the property owner empty-handed. As the Court notes, the property owner may theoretically “transfer” his previous right to develop the landmark property to adjacent properties if they are under his control. Appellees have coined this system “Transfer Development Rights,” or TDR’s.</p>
<p id="e15b2844-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of all the terms used in the Taking Clause, “just compensation” has the strictest meaning. The Fifth Amendment does not allow simply an approximate compensation but requires “a full and perfect equivalent for the property taken.” Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States, 148 U.S. 312, 326 (1893). . . . </p>
<p id="e15b2845-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellees contend that, even if they have “taken” appellants’ property, TDR’s constitute “just compensation.” Appellants, of course, argue that TDR’s are highly imperfect compensation. Because the lower courts held that there was no “taking,” they did not have to reach the question of whether or not just compensation has already been awarded. The New York Court of Appeals’ discussion of TDR’s gives some support to appellants: “The many defects in New York City’s program for development rights transfers have been detailed elsewhere. . . . The area to which transfer is permitted is severely limited [and] complex procedures are required to obtain a transfer permit.” 42 N.Y.2d 324, 334-335, 366 N.E.2d 1271, 1277 (1977).</p>
<p id="e15b2846-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And in other cases the Court of Appeals has noted that TDR’s have an “uncertain and contingent market value” and do “not adequately preserve” the value lost when a building is declared to be a landmark. French Investing Co. v. City of New York, 39 N.Y.2d 587, 591, 350 N.E.2d 381, 383, appeal dismissed, 429 U.S. 990 (1976). On the other hand, there is evidence in the record that Penn Central has been offered substantial amounts for its TDR’s. Because the record on appeal is relatively slim, I would remand to the Court of Appeals for a determination of whether TDR’s constitute a “full and perfect equivalent for the property taken.” . . . </p>

<p id="e15b284d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Factors in ad hoc review.</i></b> In <i>Pennsylvania Coal</i>, the Court engaged in an ad hoc form of review, identifying three relevant factors: (1) diminution in value; <span title="650" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-650">p. 650</span>(2) whether the regulation prevents a harm to the general public; and (3) whether the regulation secures an “average reciprocity of advantage.” In <i>Penn Central</i>, the court also uses ad hoc review, referring to its analysis as “essentially <i>ad hoc</i>, factual inquiries.” Compare with the <i>Pennsylvania Coal</i> factors the three factors Justice Brennan identifies as especially important:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="e15b284e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The economic impact of the regulation on the claimant</p></li>
<li><p id="e15b284f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The extent to which the regulation interferes with the owner’s “distinct investment-backed expectations”</p></li>
<li><p id="e15b2850-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The character of the governmental action</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="e15b2851-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How do these factors compare with the <i>Pennsylvania Coal</i> factors? Is there any overlap between the two? What about the second factor—interference with the owner’s “distinct investment-backed expectations”? Both the factor and the phrase are drawn from Professor Frank Michelman’s influential essay on takings, Property, Utility, and Fairness: Comments on the Ethical Foundations of “Just Compensation” Law, 80 Harv. L. Rev. 1165, 1229-1234 (1967). Is that factor different from the <i>Pennsylvania Coal</i> diminution-in-value test? Michelman saw the latter as calling for compensation when a claimant is deprived of “distinctly perceived, sharply crystallized, investment-backed expectations.” Id. at 1223. His discussion suggests that <i>Pennsylvania Coal</i> is a case in point, for in <i>Pennsylvania Coal</i> the claimant had a distinct interest—the support estate—that was wiped out by the Kohler Act. What about the distinct interest of Penn Central in the air rights above Grand Central Terminal?</p>
<p id="e15b2852-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Does the timing of enactment of the landmark law matter? Suppose, for example, that the law had been enacted prior to Penn Central’s purchase of Grand Central Terminal. Would that matter? See Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, 533 U.S. 606 (2001) (indicating that notice of an existing restriction would not necessarily bar a takings claim). We discuss <i>Palazzolo</i> infra at page 674.</p>
<p id="e15b2853-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>The relevant denominator.</i></b> In <i>Pennsylvania Coal</i> we encountered the “denominator problem”—determining the relevant property the value of which has diminished as a result of the regulation. In <i>Penn Central</i>, the Supreme Court regarded as the denominator the city tax block that was designated as the landmark site. Was this the proper denominator? Consider the approach taken by the New York Court of Appeals. That court stated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="e15b2854-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Numerous subways and bus routes pass through or near the terminal. Without the assistance of the city’s transit system, now municipally owned and subsidized, the property [i.e., GCT], with or without a towering office structure atop it, would be of considerably decreased value. It is true that most city property benefits to some extent from public transportation, but the benefit is peculiarly concentrated and great in the area surrounding Grand Central Terminal.</p>
<p id="e15b2855-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Absent this heavy public government investment in the terminal, the railroads, and the connecting transportation, it is indisputable that the terminal property would be worth but a fraction of its current economic value.</p>

Does the photo on page 638, which shows Grand Central Terminal in its full setting while under construction, lend support to the Court of Appeals’ analysis?</p>
<p id="e15b2857-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>TDRs.</i></b> Notice that the Court in <i>Penn Central</i> left unresolved the question whether TDRs can provide the “just compensation” required if a taking has occurred. See page 646. It appears to be the Court’s view, however, that TDRs can ease the burden of a regulation such that it will not amount to a taking. Can you <span title="651" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-651">p. 651</span>make sense of that line of thinking? If a given regulation without TDRs would be a taking but the same regulation with TDRs would not be a taking, isn’t that just a roundabout way of saying that the TDRs do in fact amount to “just compensation,” even though the value of the TDRs may fall short of the fair-market value ordinarily required in cases of condemnation? If so, the takings issue and the just-compensation requirement can be made, more or less, to disappear. See in this connection the concurring opinion of Justice Scalia in Suitum v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 520 U.S. 725, 747-748 (1997): “Putting TDRs on the taking rather than the just-compensation side of the equation . . . is a clever, albeit transparent, device that seeks to take advantage of a peculiarity of our Takings-Clause jurisprudence: Whereas once there <i>is</i> a taking, the Constitution requires just (i.e. full) compensation, . . . a regulatory taking generally does not <i>occur</i> so long as the land retains substantial (albeit not its full) value.”</p>

This case presents the question whether a minor but permanent physical occupation of an owner’s property authorized by government constitutes a “taking” of property for which just compensation is due under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution. . . .

<p id="e15b4f70-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>I.</b></p>
<p id="e15b4f71-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant Jean Loretto purchased a five-story apartment building located at 303 West 105th Street, New York City, in 1971. The previous owner had granted appellees Teleprompter Corporation and Teleprompter Manhattan CATV (collectively Teleprompter) permission to install a cable on the building and the exclusive privilege of furnishing cable television (CATV) services to the tenants. The New York Court of Appeals described the installation as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="e15b4f72-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On June 1, 1970 Teleprompter installed a cable slightly less than one-half inch in diameter and of approximately 30 feet in length along the length of the building about 18 inches above the roof top, and directional taps, approximately 4 inches by 4 inches by 4 inches, on the front and rear of the roof. By June 8, 1970 the cable had been extended another 4 to 6 feet and cable had been run from the directional taps to the adjoining building at 305 West 105th Street. [Id., at 135, 423 N.E.2d, at 324.]</p>
</div>
<p id="e15b4f73-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Teleprompter also installed two large silver boxes along the roof cables. The cables are attached by screws or nails penetrating the masonry at approximately two-foot intervals, and other equipment is installed by bolts.</p>
<p id="e15b4f74-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Initially, Teleprompter’s roof cables did not service appellant’s building. They were part of what could be described as a cable “highway” circumnavigating the city block, <span title="652" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-652">p. 652</span>with service cables periodically dropped over the front or back of a building in which a tenant desired service. Crucial to such a network is the use of so-called “crossovers”—cable lines extending from one building to another in order to reach a new group of tenants. Two years after appellant purchased the building, Teleprompter connected a “noncrossover” line—i.e., one that provided CATV service to appellant’s own tenants—by dropping a line to the first floor down the front of appellant’s building.</p>
<p id="e15b4f75-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prior to 1973, Teleprompter routinely obtained authorization for its installations from property owners along the cable’s route, compensating the owners at the standard rate of 5% of the gross revenues that Teleprompter realized from the particular property. To facilitate tenant access to CATV, the State of New York enacted §828 of the Executive Law, effective January 1, 1973. Section 828 provides that a landlord may not “interfere with the installation of cable television facilities upon his property or premises,” and may not demand payment from any tenant for permitting CATV, or demand payment from any CATV company “in excess of any amount which the [State Commission on Cable Television] shall, by regulation, determine to be reasonable.” The landlord may, however, require the CATV company or the tenant to bear the cost of installation and to indemnify for any damage caused by the installation. Pursuant to §828(1)(b), the State Commission has ruled that a onetime $1 payment is the normal fee to which a landlord is entitled. . . . The Commission ruled that this nominal fee, which the Commission concluded was equivalent to what the landlord would receive if the property were condemned pursuant to New York’s Transportation Corporations Law, satisfied constitutional requirements “in the absence of a special showing of greater damages attributable to the taking.”</p>
<p id="e15b4f76-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant did not discover the existence of the cable until after she had purchased the building. She brought a class action against Teleprompter in 1976 on behalf of all owners of real property in the State on which Teleprompter has placed CATV components, alleging that Teleprompter’s installation was a trespass and, insofar as it relied on §828, a taking without just compensation. She requested damages and injunctive relief. Appellee the City of New York, which has granted Teleprompter an exclusive franchise to provide CATV within certain areas of Manhattan, intervened. The Supreme Court, Special Term, granted summary judgment to Teleprompter and the city, upholding the constitutionality of §828 in both crossover and noncrossover situations. 98 Misc. 2d 944, 415 N.Y.S.2d 180 (1979). The Appellate Division affirmed without opinion. 73 App. Div. 2d 849, 422 N.Y.S.2d 550 (1979).</p>
<p id="e15b4f77-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On appeal, the Court of Appeals . . . ruled that the law serves a legitimate police power purpose—eliminating landlord fees and conditions that inhibit the development of CATV, which has important educational and community benefits. Rejecting the argument that a physical occupation authorized by government is necessarily a taking, the court stated that the regulation does not have an excessive economic impact upon appellant when measured against her aggregate property rights, and that it does not interfere with any reasonable investment-backed expectations. . . . </p>
<p id="e15b4f78-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>II.</b></p>
<p id="e15b4f79-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeals determined that §828 serves the legitimate public purpose of “rapid development of and maximum penetration by a means of communication which has important educational and community aspects,” and thus is within the State’s police power. We have no reason to question that determination. It is a separate question, however, whether an otherwise valid regulation so frustrates property rights that compensation must be paid. We conclude that a permanent physical occupation <span title="653" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-653">p. 653</span>authorized by government is a taking without regard to the public interests that it may serve. Our constitutional history confirms the rule, recent cases do not question it, and the purposes of the Takings Clause compel its retention.</p>

<p id="e15b4f7b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, [438 U.S. 104 (1978)], the Court surveyed some of the general principles governing the Takings Clause. The Court noted that no “set formula” existed to determine, in all cases, whether compensation is constitutionally due for a government restriction of property. Ordinarily, the Court must engage in “essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries.” Id., at 124. But the inquiry is not standardless. The economic impact of the regulation, especially the degree of interference with investment-backed expectations, is of particular significance.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="e15b4f7c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So, too, is the character of the government action. A “taking” may more readily be found when the interference with property can be characterized as a physical invasion by government, than when interference arises from some public program adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good. [Ibid.]</p>

<p id="e15b4f7d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As <i>Penn Central</i> affirms, the Court has often upheld substantial regulation of an owner’s use of his own property where deemed necessary to promote the public interest. At the same time, we have long considered a physical intrusion by government to be a property restriction of an unusually serious character for purposes of the Takings Clause. Our cases further establish that when the physical intrusion reaches the extreme form of a permanent physical occupation, a taking has occurred. In such a case, “the character of the government action” not only is an important factor in resolving whether the action works a taking but also is determinative.</p>
<p id="e15b4f7e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When faced with a constitutional challenge to a permanent physical occupation of real property, this Court has invariably found a taking. As early as 1872, in Pumpelly v. Green Bay Co., 13 Wall. 166, this Court held that the defendant’s construction, pursuant to state authority, of a dam which permanently flooded plaintiff’s property constituted a taking. A unanimous Court stated, without qualification, that “where real estate is actually invaded by superinduced additions of water, earth, sand, or other material, or by having any artificial structure placed on it, so as to effectually destroy or impair its usefulness, it is a taking, within the meaning of the Constitution.” Id., at 181. More recent cases confirm the distinction between a permanent physical occupation, a physical invasion short of an occupation, and a regulation that merely restricts the use of property. In United States v. Causby, 328 U.S. 256 (1946), the Court ruled that frequent flights immediately above a landowner’s property constituted a taking, comparing such overflights to the quintessential form of a taking:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="e15b768f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If, by reason of the frequency and altitude of the flights, respondents could not use this land for any purpose, their loss would be complete. It would be as complete as if the United States had entered upon the surface of the land and taken exclusive possession of it. [Id., at 261.] . . .</p>

<p id="e15b7690-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although this Court’s most recent cases have not addressed the precise issue before us, they have emphasized that physical <i>invasion</i> cases are special and have not repudiated the rule that any permanent physical <i>occupation</i> is a taking. The cases state or imply that a physical invasion is subject to a balancing process, but they do not suggest that a permanent physical occupation would ever be exempt from the Takings Clause. . . . </p>

<p id="e15b7691-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In short, when the “character of the governmental action,” <i>Penn Central</i>, 438 U.S., at 124, is a permanent physical occupation of property, our cases uniformly have found a taking to the extent of the occupation, without regard to whether the action achieves an important public benefit or has only minimal economic impact on the owner.</p>
<p id="e15b7692-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>B</i></p>
<p id="e15b7693-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The historical rule that a permanent physical occupation of another’s property is a taking has more than tradition to commend it. Such an appropriation is perhaps the most serious form of invasion of an owner’s property interests. . . . </p>
<p id="e15b7694-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Property rights in a physical thing have been described as the rights “to possess, use and dispose of it.” United States v. General Motors Corp., 323 U.S. 373, 378 (1945). To the extent that the government permanently occupies physical property, it effectively destroys <i>each</i> of these rights. First, the owner has no right to possess the occupied space himself, and also has no power to exclude the occupier from possession and use of the space. The power to exclude has traditionally been considered one of the most treasured strands in an owner’s bundle of property rights.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1063C_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1063C_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">1</a></span> See <i>Kaiser Aetna</i>, 444 U.S., at 179-180; see also Restatement of Property §7 (1936). Second, the permanent physical occupation of property forever denies the owner any power to control the use of the property; he not only cannot exclude others, but can make no nonpossessory use of the property. Although deprivation of the right to use and obtain a profit from property is not, in every case, independently sufficient to establish a taking, see Andrus v. Allard, supra, at 66, it is clearly relevant. Finally, even though the owner may retain the bare legal right to dispose of the occupied space by transfer or sale, the permanent occupation of that space by a stranger will ordinarily empty the right of any value, since the purchaser will also be unable to make any use of the property.</p>
<p id="e15b7697-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, an owner suffers a special kind of injury when a <i>stranger</i> directly invades and occupies the owner’s property. . . . [P]roperty law has long protected an owner’s expectation that he will be relatively undisturbed at least in the possession of his property. To require, as well, that the owner permit another to exercise complete dominion literally adds insult to injury. See Michelman, Property, Utility, and Fairness: Comments on the Ethical Foundations of “Just Compensation” Law, 80 Harv. L. Rev. 1165, 1228, and n.110 (1967). Furthermore, such an occupation is qualitatively more severe than a regulation of the <i>use</i> of property, even a regulation that imposes affirmative duties on the owner, since the owner may have no control over the timing, extent, or nature of the invasion.</p>
<p id="e15b7698-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The traditional rule also avoids otherwise difficult line-drawing problems. Few would disagree that if the State required landlords to permit third parties to install swimming pools on the landlords’ rooftops for the convenience of the tenants, the requirement would be a taking. If the cable installation here occupied as much space, again, few would disagree that the occupation would be a taking. But constitutional protection for the rights of private property cannot be made to depend on the size of the area permanently occupied. Indeed, it is possible that in the future, additional cable installations that more significantly restrict a landlord’s use of the roof of his building will be made. Section 828 requires a landlord to permit such multiple installations.</p>

<p id="e15b769c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, whether a permanent physical occupation has occurred presents relatively few problems of proof. The placement of a fixed structure on land or real property is an obvious fact that will rarely be subject to dispute. Once the fact of occupation is shown, of course, a court should consider the <i>extent</i> of the occupation as one relevant factor in determining the compensation due. For that reason, moreover, there is less need to consider the extent of the occupation in determining whether there is a taking in the first instance.</p>

<p id="e15b769e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Teleprompter’s cable installation on appellant’s building constitutes a taking under the traditional test. The installation involved a direct physical attachment of plates, boxes, wires, bolts, and screws to the building, completely occupying space immediately above and upon the roof and along the building’s exterior wall.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10685_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10685_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">2</a></span></p>
<p id="e15b76a1-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In light of our analysis we find no constitutional difference between a crossover and a noncrossover installation. The portions of the installation necessary for both crossovers and noncrossovers permanently appropriate appellant’s property. Accordingly, each type of installation is a taking.</p>
<p id="e15b76a2-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellees raise a series of objections to application of the traditional rule here. Teleprompter notes that the law applies only to buildings used as rental property, and draws the conclusion that the law is simply a permissible regulation of the use of real property. We fail to see, however, why a physical occupation of one type of property but not another type is any less a physical occupation. Insofar as Teleprompter means to suggest that this is not a permanent physical invasion, we must differ. So long as the property remains residential and a CATV company wishes to retain the installation, the landlord must permit it.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10696_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10696_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">3</a></span></p>
<p id="e15b76a4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Teleprompter also asserts the related argument that the State has effectively granted a tenant the property right to have a CATV installation placed on the roof of his building, as an appurtenance to the tenant’s leasehold. The short answer is that §828(1)(a) does not purport to give the <i>tenant</i> any enforceable property rights with respect to CATV installation, and the lower courts did not rest their decisions on this ground. Of course, Teleprompter, not appellant’s tenants, actually owns the installation. Moreover, the government does not have unlimited power to redefine property rights. Finally, we do not agree with appellees that application of the physical occupation rule will have dire consequences for the government’s power to adjust landlord-tenant relationships. This Court has consistently affirmed that States have broad power to regulate housing conditions in general and the landlord-tenant relationship in particular without paying compensation for all economic injuries that such regulation entails. In none of these cases, however, did the government authorize the permanent occupation of the landlord’s property by a third party. Consequently, our holding today in no way alters the analysis governing the State’s power to require landlords to comply with building codes and provide utility connections, mailboxes, smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, and the like in the common area of a building. So long as these regulations do not require the landlord to suffer the physical occupation of a portion of his building by a third party, they will be analyzed under the multifactor <span title="657" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-657">p. 657</span>inquiry generally applicable to nonpossessory governmental activity.

<p id="e15b76a8-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our holding today is very narrow. We affirm the traditional rule that a permanent physical occupation of property is a taking. In such a case, the property owner entertains a historically rooted expectation of compensation, and the character of the invasion is qualitatively more intrusive than perhaps any other category of property regulation. We do not, however, question the equally substantial authority upholding a State’s broad power to impose appropriate restrictions upon an owner’s <i>use</i> of his property.</p>
<p id="e15b76a9-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Furthermore, our conclusion that §828 works a taking of a portion of appellant’s property does not presuppose that the fee which many landlords had obtained by Teleprompter prior to the law’s enactment is a proper measure of the value of the property taken. The issue of the amount of compensation that is due, on which we express no opinion, is a matter for the state courts to consider on remand. . . . </p>

In a curiously anachronistic decision, the Court today acknowledges its historical disavowal of set formulae in almost the same breath as it constructs a rigid per se takings rule: “a permanent physical occupation authorized by government is a taking without regard to the public interests that it may serve.” To sustain its rule against our recent precedents, the Court erects a strained and untenable distinction between “temporary physical invasions,” whose constitutionality concededly “is subject to a balancing process,” and “permanent physical occupations,” which are “taking[s] without regard to other factors that a court might ordinarily examine.”</p>
<p id="e15b9dbb-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my view, the Court’s approach “reduces the constitutional issue to a formalistic quibble” over whether property has been “permanently occupied” or “temporarily invaded.” Sax, Takings and the Police Power, 74 Yale L.J. 36, 37 (1964). The Court’s application of its formula to the facts of this case vividly illustrates that its approach is potentially dangerous as well as misguided. . . . </p>
<p id="e15b9dbc-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s recent Takings Clause decisions teach that <i>nonphysical</i> government intrusions on private property, such as zoning ordinances and other land-use restrictions, have become the rule rather than the exception. Modern government regulation exudes intangible “externalities” that may diminish the value of private property far more than minor physical touchings. . . . </p>
<span title="658" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-658">p. 658</span>
<p id="e15b9dbd-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Precisely because the extent to which the government may injure private interests now depends so little on whether or not it has authorized a “physical contact,” the Court has avoided per se takings rules resting on outmoded distinctions between physical and nonphysical intrusions. As one commentator has observed, a takings rule based on such a distinction is inherently suspect because “its capacity to distinguish, even crudely, between significant and insignificant losses is too puny to be taken seriously.” Michelman, Property, Utility, and Fairness: Comments on the Ethical Foundations of “Just Compensation” Law, 80 Harv. L. Rev. 1165, 1227 (1967).</p>
<p id="e15b9dbe-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Surprisingly, the Court draws an even finer distinction today—between “temporary physical invasions” and “permanent physical occupations.” When the government authorizes the latter type of intrusion, the Court would find “a taking without regard to the public interests” the regulation may serve. Yet an examination of each of the three words in the Court’s “permanent physical occupation” formula illustrates that the newly created distinction is even less substantial than the distinction between physical and nonphysical intrusions that the Court already has rejected.</p>
<p id="e15b9dbf-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, what does the Court mean by “permanent”? Since all “temporary limitations on the right to exclude” remain “subject to a more complex balancing process to determine whether they are a taking,” the Court presumably describes a government intrusion that lasts forever. But as the Court itself concedes, §828 does not require appellant to permit the cable installation forever, but only “[s]o long as the property remains residential and a CATV company wishes to retain the installation.” This is far from “permanent.”</p>
<p id="e15b9dc0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . If §828 authorizes a “permanent” occupation, and thus works a taking “without regard to the public interests that it may serve,” then all other New York statutes that require a landlord to make physical attachments to his rental property also must constitute takings, even if they serve indisputably valid public interests in tenant protection and safety.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN106EB_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N106EB_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">5</a></span></p>
<p id="e15b9dc2-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court denies that its theory invalidates these statutes, because they “do not require the landlord to suffer the physical occupation of a portion of his building by a third party.” But surely this factor cannot be determinative, since the Court simultaneously recognizes that temporary invasions by third parties are not subject to a per se rule. Nor can the qualitative difference arise from the incidental fact that, under §828, Teleprompter, rather than appellant or her tenants, owns the cable installation. If anything, §828 leaves appellant better off than do other housing statutes, since it ensures that her property will not be damaged esthetically or physically, without burdening her with the cost of buying or maintaining the cable.</p>
<p id="e15b9dc3-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In any event, under the Court’s test, the “third party” problem would remain even if appellant herself owned the cable. So long as Teleprompter continuously passed its electronic signal through the cable, a litigant could argue that the second element of the Court’s formula—a “physical touching” by a stranger—was satisfied and that §828 therefore worked a taking. Literally read, the Court’s test opens the door to endless metaphysical struggles over whether or not an individual’s property has been “physically” touched. . . . </p>
<p id="e15b9dc4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, the Court’s talismanic distinction between a continuous “occupation” and a transient “invasion” finds no basis in either economic logic or Takings Clause <span title="659" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-659">p. 659</span>precedent. In the landlord-tenant context, the Court has upheld against takings challenges rent control statutes permitting “temporary” physical invasions of considerable economic magnitude. . . . </p>
<p id="e15b9dc5-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For constitutional purposes, the relevant question cannot be solely <i>whether</i> the State has interfered in some minimal way with an owner’s use of space on her building. Any intelligible takings inquiry must also ask whether the <i>extent</i> of the State’s interference is so severe as to constitute a compensable taking in light of the owner’s alternative uses for the property. Appellant freely admitted that she would have had no other use for the cable-occupied space, were Teleprompter’s equipment not on her building.</p>
<p id="e15b9dc6-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s third and final argument is that §828 has deprived appellant of her “power to exclude the occupier from possession and use of the space” occupied by the cable. This argument has two flaws. First, it unjustifiably assumes that appellant’s tenants have no countervailing property interest in permitting Teleprompter to use that space.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1070C_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1070C_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">6</a></span> Second, it suggests that the New York legislature may not exercise its police power to affect appellant’s common-law right to exclude Teleprompter even from one-eighth cubic foot of roof space. . . . </p>

Department of Agriculture, 135 S. Ct. 2419 (2015), the Supreme Court held that the per se rule for physical takings applies to personal property as well as to land. The case involved a government regulatory program designed to shore up the price of raisins by requiring farmers to hand over to the government a certain percentage of their raisin crop. The Court determined that this program constituted a categorical physical taking of personal property. The Court made a sharp distinction between a physical taking of personal property and a regulation of its use. The latter does not effect a per se taking; indeed, the taking clause permits many forms of regulation of personal property (e.g., regulation of dangerous drugs). In dissent, Justice Sotomayor argued that this was a distinction without a difference.</p>

<p id="e15b9dd4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the Supreme Court decided a series of cases that developed an important doctrine known as the <i>noxious use</i> or <i>public nuisance</i> doctrine. According to this doctrine, a regulation enacted pursuant to the state’s police power for the purpose of abating a public nuisance is not a taking, even if it results in a substantial loss for the owner. See, e.g., Hadacheck v. Sebastian, 239 U.S. 394 (1915) (city ordinance prohibiting manufacture of bricks within city limits not a taking, notwithstanding decline in value of claimant’s factory from $800,000 to $60,000); Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623 (1887) (statute prohibiting manufacture of alcohol not a taking despite forcing claimant’s brewery out of business). Though not without its defenders, the noxious use doctrine has been criticized as a basis for deciding when a regulation amounts to a taking. In his influential 1967 Harvard Law Review article, Professor Frank Michelman identified a “basic difficulty” with the doctrine: in the absence of a neutral benchmark, a regulation that purports to prevent public harms (and therefore triggers no compensation obligation) can just as easily be seen as one that extracts a benefit from an owner for the public (triggering a constitutional obligation to compensate the owner). See Michelman, Property, Utility, and Fairness, supra, at 1196-1197. Consider how the Supreme Court deals with this problem in the case that follows.</p>

But what if the regulation claims to control a nuisance? Or what if the property owner had no “investment-backed expectations” (<i>Penn Central</i>, on page 643)? The following case addresses these questions.</p>

[South Carolina began managing its coastal zone in 1977, when it enacted a Coastal Zone Management Act (the federal government had enacted similar legislation in 1972). The 1977 law required owners of coastal land in “critical areas” (including beaches and immediately adjacent sand dunes) to obtain a permit from the South Carolina Coastal Council prior to committing the land to a use other than the use that the critical area was devoted to on September 28, 1977.</p>
<p id="e15bc4ec-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1986, petitioner Lucas paid $975,000 for two residential lots on an island off the coast of South Carolina. He intended to build single-family houses on the lots and, because no parts of the parcels were critical areas under the 1977 legislation, he did not need to get a permit. His plans to build, however, were halted by new legislation, the Beachfront Management Act, enacted by the state in 1988. The act had the direct effect of barring Lucas from building any permanent habitable structures on his two lots. A state trial court found that the act made Lucas’s property “valueless.”</p>

<p id="e15bc4ff-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prior to Justice Holmes’ exposition in Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393 (1922), it was generally thought that the Takings Clause reached only a “direct <span title="662" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-662">p. 662</span>appropriation” of property, Legal Tender Cases, 12 Wall. 457, 551 (1871), or the functional equivalent of a “practical ouster of [the owner’s] possession.” Transportation Co. v. Chicago, 99 U.S. 635, 642 (1879). . . . Justice Holmes recognized in <i>Mahon</i>, however, that if the protection against physical appropriations of private property was to be meaningfully enforced, the government’s power to redefine the range of interests included in the ownership of property was necessarily constrained by constitutional limits. . . . These considerations gave birth in that case to the oft-cited maxim that, “while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.”</p>
<p id="e15bc500-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nevertheless, our decision in <i>Mahon</i> offered little insight into when, and under what circumstances, a given regulation would be seen as going “too far” for purposes of the Fifth Amendment. In 70-odd years of succeeding “regulatory takings” jurisprudence, we have generally eschewed any “‘set formula”’ for determining how far is too far, preferring to “engag[e] in . . . essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries,” Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 124 (1978) (quoting Goldblatt v. Hempstead, 369 U.S. 590, 594 (1962)). See Epstein, Takings: Descent and Resurrection, 1987 Sup. Ct. Rev. 1, 4. We have, however, described at least two discrete categories of regulatory action as compensable without case-specific inquiry into the public interest advanced in support of the restraint. The first encompasses regulations that compel the property owner to suffer a physical “invasion” of his property. In general (at least with regard to permanent invasions), no matter how minute the intrusion, and no matter how weighty the public purpose behind it, we have required compensation [citing <i>Loretto</i>, reproduced at page 651].</p>
<p id="e15bec11-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second situation in which we have found categorical treatment appropriate is where regulation denies all economically beneficial or productive use of land. . . . As we have said on numerous occasions, the Fifth Amendment is violated when land-use regulation “does not substantially advance legitimate state interests <i>or denies an owner economically viable use of his land.</i>” [Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U.S. 255, 260 (1980).]<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1082E_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1082E_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">7</a></span></p>
<p id="e15bec13-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have never set forth the justification for this rule. Perhaps it is simply, as Justice Brennan suggested, that total deprivation of beneficial use is, from the landowner’s <span title="663" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-663">p. 663</span>point of view, the equivalent of a physical appropriation. See San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. San Diego, 450 U.S., at 652 (Brennan, J., dissenting). “[F]or what is the land but the profits thereof[?]” 1 E. Coke, Institutes ch. 1, §1 (1st Am. ed. 1812). Surely, at least, in the extraordinary circumstance when <i>no</i> productive or economically beneficial use of land is permitted, it is less realistic to indulge our usual assumption that the legislature is simply “adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life,” <i>Penn Central Transportation Co</i>., 438 U.S., at 124, in a manner that secures an “average reciprocity of advantage” to everyone concerned. Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S., at 415. And the <i>functional</i> basis for permitting the government, by regulation, to affect property values without compensation—that “Government hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law,” id., at 413—does not apply to the relatively rare situations where the government has deprived a landowner of all economically beneficial uses.</p>
<p id="e15bec14-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other side of the balance, affirmatively supporting a compensation requirement, is the fact that regulations that leave the owner of land without economically beneficial or productive options for its use—typically, as here, by requiring land to be left substantially in its natural state—carry with them a heightened risk that private property is being pressed into some form of public service under the guise of mitigating serious public harm. . . . As Justice Brennan explained: “From the government’s point of view, the benefits flowing to the public from preservation of open space through regulation may be equally great as from creating a wildlife refuge through formal condemnation or increasing electricity production through a dam project that floods private property.” <i>San Diego Gas &amp; Elec. Co.</i>, supra, 450 U.S., at 652 (Brennan, J., dissenting). The many statutes on the books, both state and federal, that provide for the use of eminent domain to impose servitudes on private scenic lands preventing developmental uses, or to acquire such lands altogether, suggest the practical equivalence in this setting of negative regulation and appropriation. . . . </p>
<p id="e15bec15-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think, in short, that there are good reasons for our frequently expressed belief that when the owner of real property has been called upon to sacrifice <i>all</i> economically beneficial uses in the name of the common good, that is, to leave his property economically idle, he has suffered a taking.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10853_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10853_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">8</a></span></p>

<p id="e15bec1c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court found Lucas’s two beachfront lots to have been rendered valueless by respondent’s enforcement of the coastal-zone construction ban. Under Lucas’s theory of the case, which rested upon our “no economically viable use” statements, that finding entitled him to compensation. Lucas believed it unnecessary to take issue with either the purposes behind the Beachfront Management Act, or the means chosen by the South Carolina Legislature to effectuate those purposes. The South Carolina Supreme Court, however, thought otherwise. In its view, the Beachfront Management Act was no ordinary enactment, but involved an exercise of South Carolina’s “police powers” to mitigate the harm to the public interest that petitioner’s use of his land might occasion. By neglecting to dispute the findings enumerated in the Act or otherwise to challenge the legislature’s purposes, petitioner concede[d] that the beach/dune area of South Carolina’s shores is an extremely valuable public resource; that the erection of new construction, <i>inter alia</i>, contributes to the erosion and destruction of this public resource; and that discouraging new construction in close proximity to the beach/dune area is necessary to prevent a great public harm. In the court’s view, these concessions brought petitioner’s challenge within a long line of this Court’s cases sustaining against Due Process and Takings Clause challenges the State’s use of its “police powers” to  enjoin a property owner from activities akin to public nuisances. See Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623 (1887) (law prohibiting manufacture of alcoholic beverages); Hadacheck v. Sebastian, 239 U.S. 394 (1915) (law barring operation of brick mill in residential area); Miller v. Schoene, 276 U.S. 272 (1928) (order to destroy diseased cedar trees to prevent infection of nearby orchards); Goldblatt v. Hempstead, 369 U.S. 590 (1962) (law effectively preventing continued operation of quarry in residential area).</p>
<p id="e15bec1d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is correct that many of our prior opinions have suggested that “harmful or noxious uses” of property may be proscribed by government regulation without the <span title="665" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-665">p. 665</span>requirement of compensation. For a number of reasons, however, we think the South Carolina Supreme Court was too quick to conclude that that principle decides the present case. The “harmful or noxious uses” principle was the Court’s early attempt to describe in theoretical terms why government may, consistent with the Takings Clause, affect property values by regulation without incurring an obligation to compensate—a reality we nowadays acknowledge explicitly with respect to the full scope of the State’s police power. . . . “Harmful or noxious use” analysis was, in other words, simply the progenitor of our more contemporary statements that “land-use regulation does not effect a taking if it ‘substantially advance[s] legitimate state interests.’ . . .” Nollan [v. California Coastal Commn., 483 U.S. 825, 834 (1987)] (quoting Agins v. Tiburon, 447 U.S., at 260). . . . </p>
<p id="e15bec1e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The transition from our early focus on control of “noxious” uses to our contemporary understanding of the broad realm within which government may regulate without compensation was an easy one, since the distinction between “harm-preventing” and “benefit-conferring” regulation is often in the eye of the beholder. It is quite possible, for example, to describe in <i>either</i> fashion the ecological, economic, and aesthetic concerns that inspired the South Carolina legislature in the present case. One could say that imposing a servitude on Lucas’s land is necessary in order to prevent his use of it from “harming” South Carolina’s ecological resources; or, instead, in order to achieve the “benefits” of an ecological preserve. . . . Whether one or the other of the competing characterizations will come to one’s lips in a particular case depends primarily upon one’s evaluation of the worth of competing uses of real estate. . . . A given restraint will be seen as mitigating “harm” to the adjacent parcels or securing a “benefit” for them, depending upon the observer’s evaluation of the relative importance of the use that the restraint favors. . . . Whether Lucas’s construction of single-family residences on his parcels should be described as bringing “harm” to South Carolina’s adjacent ecological resources thus depends principally upon whether the describer believes that the State’s use interest in nurturing those resources is so important that <i>any</i> competing adjacent use must yield.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10892_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10892_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">9</a></span></p>
<p id="e15bec20-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When it is understood that “prevention of harmful use” was merely our early formulation of the police power justification necessary to sustain (without compensation) <i>any</i> regulatory diminution in value; and that the distinction between regulation that “prevents harmful use” and that which “confers benefits” is difficult, if not impossible, to discern on an objective, value-free basis; it becomes self-evident that noxious-use logic cannot serve as a touchstone to distinguish regulatory “takings”—which require compensation—from regulatory deprivations that do not require compensation. <i>A fortiori</i> the legislature’s recitation of a noxious-use justification cannot be the basis for departing from our categorical rule that total regulatory takings must be compensated. If it were, departure would virtually always be allowed. The South Carolina Supreme Court’s approach would essentially nullify <i>Mahon</i>’s affirmation of limits to the noncompensable exercise of the police power. Our cases provide no support for this: None of them that employed the logic of “harmful use” prevention to sustain a regulation involved an allegation that the regulation wholly eliminated the value of the claimant’s land. . . . </p>
<span title="666" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-666">p. 666</span>
<p id="e15c1331-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where the State seeks to sustain regulation that deprives land of all economically beneficial use, we think it may resist compensation only if the logically antecedent inquiry into the nature of the owner’s estate shows that the proscribed use interests were not part of his title to begin with. This accords, we think, with our “takings” jurisprudence, which has traditionally been guided by the understandings of our citizens regarding the content of, and the State’s power over, the “bundle of rights” that they acquire when they obtain title to property. It seems to us that the property owner necessarily expects the uses of his property to be restricted, from time to time, by various measures newly enacted by the State in legitimate exercise of its police powers. . . . And in the case of personal property, by reason of the State’s traditionally high degree of control over commercial dealings, he ought to be aware of the possibility that new regulation might even render his property economically worthless (at least if the property’s only economically productive use is sale or manufacture for sale), see Andrus v. Allard, 444 U.S. 51, 66-67 (1979) (prohibition on sale of eagle feathers). In the case of land, however, we think the notion pressed by the Council that title is somehow held subject to the “implied limitation” that the State may subsequently eliminate all economically valuable use is inconsistent with the historical compact recorded in the Takings Clause that has become part of our constitutional culture.</p>
<p id="e15c1332-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where “permanent physical occupation” of land is concerned, we have refused to allow the government to decree it anew (without compensation), no matter how weighty the asserted “public interests” involved, Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S., at 426—though we assuredly <i>would</i> permit the government to assert a permanent easement that was a pre-existing limitation upon the landowner’s title. . . . We believe similar treatment must be accorded confiscatory regulations, i.e., regulations that prohibit all economically beneficial use of land: Any limitation so severe cannot be newly legislated or decreed (without compensation), but must inhere in the title itself, in the restrictions that background principles of the State’s law of property and nuisance already place upon land ownership. A law or decree with such an effect must, in other words, do no more than duplicate the result that could have been achieved in the courts—by adjacent landowners (or other uniquely affected persons) under the State’s law of private nuisance, or by the State under its complementary power to abate nuisances that affect the public generally, or otherwise.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN108B1_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N108B1_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">10</a></span></p>
<p id="e15c1334-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On this analysis, the owner of a lake bed, for example, would not be entitled to compensation when he is denied the requisite permit to engage in a landfilling operation that would have the effect of flooding others’ land. Nor the corporate owner of a nuclear generating plant, when it is directed to remove all improvements from its land upon discovery that the plant sits astride an earthquake fault. Such regulatory action may well have the effect of eliminating the land’s only economically productive use, but it does not proscribe a productive use that was previously permissible under relevant property and nuisance principles. The use of these properties for what are now expressly prohibited purposes was <i>always</i> unlawful, and (subject to other constitutional limitations) it was open to the State at any point to make the implication of those background principles of nuisance and property law explicit. . . . In light of our traditional resort to “existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent <span title="667" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-667">p. 667</span>source such as state law” to define the range of interests that qualify for protection as “property” under the Fifth (and Fourteenth) amendments, . . . this recognition that the Takings Clause does not require compensation when an owner is barred from putting land to a use that is proscribed by those “existing rules or understandings” is surely unexceptional. When, however, a regulation that declares “off-limits” all economically productive or beneficial uses of land goes beyond what the relevant background principles would dictate, compensation must be paid to sustain it.</p>
<p id="e15c1335-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The “total taking” inquiry we require today will ordinarily entail (as the application of state nuisance law ordinarily entails) analysis of, among other things, the degree of harm to public lands and resources, or adjacent private property, posed by the claimant’s proposed activities, see, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Torts §§826, 827, the social value of the claimant’s activities and their suitability to the locality in question, see, e.g., id., §§828(a) and (b), 831, and the relative ease with which the alleged harm can be avoided through measures taken by the claimant and the government (or adjacent private landowners) alike, see, e.g., id., §§827(e), 828(c), 830. The fact that a particular use has long been engaged in by similarly situated owners ordinarily imports a lack of any common-law prohibition (though changed circumstances or new knowledge may make what was previously permissible no longer so, see Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra, §827, comment g). So also does the fact that other landowners, similarly situated, are permitted to continue the use denied to the claimant.</p>

Beckwith, 449 U.S. 155, 164 (1980). Instead, as it would be required to do if it sought to restrain Lucas in a common-law action for public nuisance, South Carolina must identify background principles of nuisance and property law that prohibit the uses he now intends in the circumstances in which the property is presently found.

(2) The finding that Lucas’s property had no value was “curious.” “I share the reservations of some of my colleagues about a finding that a beach front lot loses all value because of a development restriction.” (3) “The finding of no value must be considered under the Takings Clause <span title="668" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-668">p. 668</span>by reference to the owner’s reasonable, investment-backed expectations. . . . There is an inherent tendency towards circularity in this synthesis, of course; for if the owner’s reasonable expectations are shaped by what courts allow as a proper exercise of governmental authority, property tends to become what courts say it is. Some circularity must be tolerated in these matters, however, as it is in other spheres. . . . The definition, moreover, is not circular in its entirety. The expectations protected by the Constitution are based on objective rules and customs that can be understood as reasonable by all parties involved.” (4) “In my view, reasonable expectations must be understood in light of the whole of our legal tradition. The common law of nuisance is too narrow a confine for the exercise of regulatory power in a complex and interdependent society.”</p>

According to the Court, such an occasion never has arisen in any of our prior cases, and the Court imagines that it will arise “relatively rarely” or only in “extraordinary circumstances.” Almost certainly it did not happen in this case. Nonetheless, the Court presses on to decide the issue, and as it does, it ignores its jurisdictional limits, remakes its traditional rules of review, and creates simultaneously a new categorical rule and an exception (neither of which is rooted in our prior case law, common law, or common sense).

The Court creates its new takings jurisprudence based on the trial court’s finding that the property had lost all economic value. This finding is almost certainly erroneous. Petitioner still can enjoy other attributes of ownership, such as the right to exclude others, “one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property.” Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 U.S. 164, 176. Petitioner can picnic, swim, camp in a tent, or live on the property in a movable trailer. State courts frequently have recognized that land has economic value where the only residual economic uses are recreation or camping. . . .

<p id="e15c3a55-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court repeatedly has recognized the ability of government, in certain circumstances, to regulate property without compensation no matter how adverse the financial effect on the owner may be. More than a century ago, the Court explicitly upheld the right of States to prohibit uses of property injurious to public health, safety, or welfare without paying compensation: “A prohibition simply upon the use of property for purposes that are declared, by valid legislation, to be injurious to the health, morals, or safety of the community, cannot, in any just sense, be deemed a taking or an appropriation of property.” Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S., at 668-669 (1887). On this basis, the Court upheld an ordinance effectively prohibiting operation of a previously lawful brewery, although the “establishments will become of no value as property.” . . . </p>
<p id="e15c3a56-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court recognizes that “our prior opinions have suggested that ‘harmful or noxious uses’ of property may be proscribed by government regulation without the requirement of compensation,” but seeks to reconcile them with its categorical rule by claiming that the Court never has upheld a regulation when the owner alleged the loss of all economic value. Even if the Court’s factual premise were correct, its understanding of the Court’s cases is distorted. In none of the cases did the Court suggest that the right of a State to prohibit certain activities without paying compensation turned on the availability of some residual valuable use. Instead, the cases depended on whether the government interest was sufficient to prohibit the activity, given the significant private cost.</p>
<p id="e15c3a57-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These cases rest on the principle that the State has full power to prohibit an owner’s use of property if it is harmful to the public. “[S]ince no individual has a right to use his property so as to create a nuisance or otherwise harm others, the State has not ‘taken’ anything when it asserts its power to enjoin the nuisance-like activity.” <i>Keystone Bituminous Coal</i>, 480 U.S., at 491, n. 20.

<p id="e15c3a5a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Until today, the Court explicitly had rejected the contention that the government’s power to act without paying compensation turns on whether the prohibited activity is a common-law nuisance. The brewery closed in <i>Mugler</i> itself was not a common-law nuisance, and the Court specifically stated that it was the role of the legislature to determine what measures would be appropriate for the protection of public health and safety. See 123 U.S., at 661, 8 S. Ct., at 297. In upholding the state action in <i>Miller</i>, the Court found it unnecessary to “weigh with nicety the question whether the infected cedars constitute a nuisance according to common law; or whether they may be so declared by statute.” 276 U.S., at 280, 48 S. Ct., at 248. Instead the Court has relied in the past, as the South Carolina court has done here, on legislative judgments of what constitutes a harm.</p>
<p id="e15c3a5b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court rejects the notion that the State always can prohibit uses it deems a harm to the public without granting compensation because “the distinction between ‘harm-preventing’ and ‘benefit-conferring’ regulation is often in the eye of the beholder.” Since the characterization will depend “primarily upon one’s evaluation of the worth of competing uses of real estate,” the Court decides a legislative judgment of this kind no longer can provide the desired “objective, value-free basis” for upholding a regulation. The Court, however, fails to explain how its proposed common-law alternative escapes the same trap.</p>
<p id="e15c3a5c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The threshold inquiry for imposition of the Court’s new rule, “deprivation of all economically valuable use,” itself cannot be determined objectively. As the Court admits, whether the owner has been deprived of all economic value of his property will depend on how “property” is defined. The “composition of the denominator in our ‘deprivation’ fraction,” is the dispositive inquiry. Yet there is no “objective” way to define what that denominator should be. “We have long understood that any land-use regulation can be characterized as the ‘total’ deprivation of an aptly defined entitlement. . . . Alternatively, the same regulation can always be characterized as a mere ‘partial’ withdrawal from full, unencumbered ownership of the landholding affected by the regulation. . . .” Michelman, Takings, 1987, 88 Colum. L. Rev. 1600, 1614 (1988). . . . </p>
<p id="e15c3a5d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even more perplexing, however, is the Court’s reliance on common-law principles of nuisance in its quest for a value-free takings jurisprudence. In determining what is a nuisance at common law, state courts make exactly the decision that the Court finds so troubling when made by the South Carolina General Assembly today: They determine whether the use is harmful. Common-law public and private nuisance law is simply a determination whether a particular use causes harm. See Prosser, Private Action for <span title="671" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-671">p. 671</span>Public Nuisance, 52 Va. L. Rev. 997 (1966) (“<i>Nuisance</i> is a French word which means nothing more than harm”). There is nothing magical in the reasoning of judges long dead. They determined a harm in the same way as state judges and legislatures do today. If judges in the 18th and 19th centuries can distinguish a harm from a benefit, why not judges in the 20th century, and if judges can, why not legislators? There simply is no reason to believe that new interpretations of the hoary common-law nuisance doctrine will be particularly “objective” or “value free.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10948_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10948_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">13</a></span> Once one abandons the level of generality of <i>sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas</i>, one searches in vain, I think, for anything resembling a principle in the common law of nuisance.</p>
<p id="e15c3a5f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the Court justifies its new rule that the legislature may not deprive a property owner of the only economically valuable use of his land, even if the legislature finds it to be a harmful use, because such action is not part of the “ ‘long recognized’ ” “understandings of our citizens.” These “understandings” permit such regulation only if the use is a nuisance under the common law. Any other course is “inconsistent with the historical compact recorded in the Takings Clause.” It is not clear from the Court’s opinion where our “historical compact” or “citizens’ understanding” comes from, but it does not appear to be history.</p>

Nothing in the discussions in Congress concerning the Takings Clause indicates that the Clause was limited by the common-law nuisance doctrine. Common-law courts themselves rejected such an understanding. They regularly recognized that it is “for the legislature to interpose, and by positive enactment to prohibit a use of property which would be injurious to the public.” [Commonwealth v. Tewksbury, 11 Metc., at 57 (Mass. 1846).] Chief Justice Shaw explained in upholding a regulation prohibiting construction of wharves, the existence of a taking did not depend on “whether a certain erection in tide water is a nuisance at common law or not.” [Commonwealth v.

<p id="e15c6178-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In short, I find no clear and accepted “historical compact” or “understanding of our citizens” justifying the Court’s new takings doctrine. Instead, the Court seems to treat history as a grab bag of principles, to be adopted where they support the Court’s theory, and ignored where they do not. If the Court decided that the early common law provides the background principles for interpreting the Takings Clause, then regulation, as opposed to physical confiscation, would not be compensable. If the Court decided that the law of a later period provides the background principles, then regulation might be compensable, but the Court would have to confront the fact that legislatures regularly determined which uses were prohibited, independent of the common law, and independent of whether the uses were lawful when the owner purchased. What makes the Court’s analysis unworkable is its attempt to package the law of two incompatible eras and peddle it as historical fact. . . . </p>

The smaller the estate, the more likely that a regulatory change will effect a total taking. Thus, an investor may, for example, purchase the right to build a multifamily home on a specific lot, with the result that a zoning regulation that allows only single-family homes would render the investor’s property interest “valueless.” In short, the categorical rule will likely have one of two effects: Either courts will alter the definition of the “denominator” in the takings “fraction,” rendering the Court’s categorical rule meaningless, or investors will manipulate the relevant property interests, giving the Court’s rule sweeping effect. To my mind, neither of these results is desirable or appropriate, and both are distortions of our takings jurisprudence. . . . </p>

<p id="e15c6184-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, some legislative redefinitions of property will effect a taking and must be compensated—but it certainly cannot be the case that every movement away from common law does so. There is no reason, and less sense, in such an absolute rule. We live in a world in which changes in the economy and the environment occur with increasing frequency and importance. . . .

<p id="e15c8898-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On remand, the South Carolina Supreme Court held that the restrictions imposed by the Beachfront Management Act would not been authorized under the state’s background nuisance law. Hence the act imposed a total taking, and the state could either abandon the law or condemn Lucas’s property. However, the parties eventually settled the case. Lucas received $1,575,000 and transferred the two lots to the Coastal Council. Strapped for money, the Council sold the lots to—a developer! Eventually, houses were built on the two lots. For a full account of the case, see Vicki C. Been, Lucas v.

What is the status of conceptual severance after the Court’s opinion in <i>Lucas</i>? Does Justice Scalia endorse the approach that the Court had taken in <i>Penn Central</i>? Stating the question differently, what is the denominator in the relevant fraction after <i>Lucas</i>?</p>
<p id="e15c889c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Rules and exceptions.</i></b> <i>Lucas</i> adds another rule of per se takings liability to that of <i>Loretto</i>’s permanent physical occupation rule. But what Justice Scalia added with one hand, he took away with the other: he created an exception to the loss-of-all-economically-beneficial-use rule where the restriction stemmed from “background principles” of state nuisance law. How broad will that exception be? What will be the source(s) to which lower courts are to look to discover these background principles? Will they vary from state to state? Will they evolve over time? Notice that Justice Scalia relied on the Restatement of Torts as a source for identifying these nuisance principles. The Restatement basically defines nuisance according to an ad hoc balancing test. So, does Justice Scalia’s exception swallow up his rule?</p>
<p id="e15c889d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Of missiles and mice.</i></b> Consider the opening words of Justice Blackmun’s dissenting opinion in <i>Lucas</i>: “Today, the court launches a missile to kill a mouse.” <i>Is</i> the target is just a mouse? Is <i>Lucas</i> insignificant because regulatory programs rarely wipe out value altogether?</p>
<p id="e15c889e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Related to the last question, can a state avoid the Lucas per se rule by leaving the owner with a token use of the property? In Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, 533 U.S. 606 (2001), a state law restricting wetlands development allowed an owner to build only one house on his 18-acre parcel, reducing its value from $3,150,000 to $200,000—a 94 percent decrease. The Court rejected the argument that this was a <i>Lucas</i>-type <span title="675" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-675">p. 675</span>total taking: “A regulation permitting a landowner to build a substantial residence on an 18-acre parcel does not leave the property ‘economically idle.’ ” 533 U.S. at 631.</p>
<p id="e15c889f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>The temporal dimension of takings.</i></b> Suppose a local planning agency imposes a moratorium on development while studying the impact of growth on the area and preparing a comprehensive land use plan. During the period of the moratorium, undeveloped land has no market value whatsoever. Does this result in a per se taking under <i>Lucas</i>? An earlier decision by the United States Supreme Court suggested, but did not hold, that the answer is yes. See First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U.S. 304 (1987). Subsequently, in Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 535 U.S. 302 (2002), however, the Court held that such a moratorium on development did not constitute a per se taking. Justice Stevens’s majority opinion expressly rejected the attempt to apply temporal conceptual severance, concluding that for purposes of a takings analysis, severing a property interest in terms of time is no more appropriate than severing it in terms of space. More recently, in Arkansas Game &amp; Fish Comm’n v. United States, 133 S. Ct. 511 (2012), the Court unanimously held that the mere fact that flooding resulting from deviations by the Army Corps of Engineers from a flood control plan was temporary did not immunize the government from a takings claim. At the same time, the Court reaffirmed its preference for “situation-specific factual inquiries.”</p>

<p id="e15cafb2-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Exactions</i> are local government measures that require developers to provide goods and services or pay fees as a condition to getting project approval. For a good account, see William A. Fischel, Regulatory Takings: Law, Economics, and Politics 341-351 (1995). Professor Fischel says that exactions were once small potatoes. Developers were willing to pay for sidewalks, sewer connections, and so forth in exchange for building permits, because these public goods yielded private benefits to the developers’ projects. When communities wanted improvements that benefited everybody in the area generally—improvements not so directly linked to satisfying service demands created by new development itself—they relied on property taxes and government grants to provide the wherewithal.</p>
<p id="e15cafb3-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But this situation changed, and eventually exactions became a common substitute means of funding public improvements. Fischel attributes the transformation to the dramatic expansion of land use regulation that began about 1970. Exactions are toothless without overlying regulations that limit development in the first place; for local communities, enacting regulations is like printing money, because the legal restrictions can be relaxed in exchange for goods and services. The politics of the strategy are pretty obvious, and finally exactions became so common and troublesome that the Supreme Court intervened.</p>
<p id="e15cafb4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s first intervention came in Nollan v. California Coastal Comm’n, 483 U.S. 825 (1987). The Nollans owned a dilapidated bungalow on a beachfront lot, north and south of which were public beaches. They had bought the property under an obligation that they demolish and replace the bungalow with a <span title="676" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-676">p. 676</span>larger house, and to do this they had to get a permit from the Coastal Commission. The Commission was willing to grant them the permit, but only on condition that the Nollans allow the public an easement to pass laterally along the beach behind their house, to go back and forth between the public beaches. The Nollans sued to have the condition invalidated, arguing that it was a taking. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court declared the exaction a taking. Justice Scalia, writing for the majority, assumed that the Commission could have denied the permit outright for the purpose of ensuring “visual access” to the beaches and preventing overcrowding. But, he said, there was no “essential nexus” between the legitimate public purposes and the means imposed—the lateral access—to achieve them. He stated, “[U]nless the permit condition serves the same governmental purpose as the development ban, the building restriction is not a valid regulation of land but an ‘out-and-out plan of extortion.’ ” Id. at 837 (citation omitted).</p>
<p id="e15cafb5-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What the Court left unclear in <i>Nollan</i> was whether it was announcing a general requirement that all land use regulations satisfy some level of means-end instrumental fit or instead declaring a requirement that applied to exactions only. In the case that follows, the Court refined the <i>Nollan</i> requirement and indicated that exactions are a matter of special takings concern.</p>
<p id="e15cafb6-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second intervention answered one question that the Court left open in <i>Nollan</i>: just how much of a connection was required between the exaction and the government purpose? In Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U.S. 374 (1994), Florence Dolan sought a permit from the city to expand her plumbing store and to pave her parking lot. The city granted the permit subject to conditions that she either convey or dedicate two portions of her land: (1) one located in the floodplain of a creek adjacent to her property; and (2) a portion to be used as a link within a pedestrian/bicycle pathway. The Court found that the <i>Nollan</i> requirement was met because an essential nexus existed between these exactions and the government objectives. But the Court added another requirement: a “rough proportionality” must exist between the exaction and the impact of the proposed development. On the facts of the case, the Court concluded that the required proportionality did not exist. Why did Dolan have to provide property for the city’s floodplain system? The requirement would make sense, the Court said, if her project would impact the existing system, but it would not. As to the second condition, it is true that Dolan’s project would probably create more traffic, but the city failed to establish the relationship between the additional traffic and the pathway it sought. The city “must make some effort to quantify its findings in support of the dedication” beyond a conclusory statement, the Court said.</p>
<p id="e15cafb7-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s third and most recent intervention came in Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Management District, 133 S. Ct. 2586 (2013). In that case the Court held that the <i>Nollan-Dolan</i> doctrine applies to monetary exactions as well as to mandated dedications of land. The Water Management District proposed permitting an owner to dredge his property on condition that he fund offsite mitigation projects on public land. In <i>Koontz</i>, in a 5-4 decision, the Court clarified that the <i>Nollan-Dolan</i> doctrine was a particular application of the unconstitutional conditional doctrine and that it applied equally if the permit condition required monetary payment rather than forced dedication of an easement or land.</p>

<p id="e15cd6d2-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Generally speaking, state law defines property interests, including property rights in navigable waters and the lands underneath them. In Florida, the State owns in trust for the public the land permanently submerged beneath navigable waters and the foreshore (the land between the low-tide line and the mean high-water line). Fla. Const., Art. X, §11; Broward v. Mabry, 50 So. 826, 829-830 (1909). Thus, the mean high-water line (the average reach of high tide over the preceding 19 years) is the ordinary boundary between private beachfront, or littoral<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10AB0_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10AB0_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">15</a></span> property, and state-owned land.</p>
<p id="e15cd6d4-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Littoral owners have, in addition to the rights of the public, certain “special rights” with regard to the water and the foreshore, <i>Broward</i>, 50 So., at 830, rights which Florida considers to be property, generally akin to easements, see ibid.; Thiesen v. Gulf, Florida &amp; Alabama R. Co., 78 So. 491, 500, 507 (1918) (on rehearing). These include the right of access to the water, the right to use the water for certain purposes, the right to an unobstructed view of the water, and the right to receive accretions and relictions to the littoral property. This is generally in accord with well-established common law, although the precise property rights vary among jurisdictions.</p>
<p id="e15cd6d5-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the center of this case is the right to accretions and relictions. Accretions are additions of alluvion (sand, sediment, or other deposits) to waterfront land; relictions are lands once covered by water that become dry when the water recedes. (For simplicity’s sake, we shall refer to accretions and relictions collectively as accretions, and the process whereby they occur as accretion.) In order for an addition to dry land to qualify as an accretion, it must have occurred gradually and imperceptibly—that is, so slowly that one could not see the change occurring, though over time the difference became apparent. When, on the other hand, there is a “sudden or perceptible loss of or addition to land by the action of the water or a sudden change in the bed of a <span title="678" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-678">p. 678</span>lake or the course of a stream,” the change is called an avulsion. Sand Key [Board of Trustees of Internal Improvement Trust Fund v. Sand Key Assoc. Ltd., 512 So. 2d 934 (Fla. 1987)], <i>supra</i>, at 936.</p>
<p id="e15cd6d6-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Florida, as at common law, the littoral owner automatically takes title to dry land added to his property by accretion; but formerly submerged land that has become dry land by avulsion continues to belong to the owner of the seabed (usually the State). Thus, regardless of whether an avulsive event exposes land previously submerged or submerges land previously exposed, the boundary between littoral property and sovereign land does not change; it remains (ordinarily) what was the mean high-water line before the event. It follows from this that, when a new strip of land has been added to the shore by avulsion, the littoral owner has no right to subsequent accretions. Those accretions no longer add to his property, since the property abutting the water belongs not to him but to the State.</p>
<p id="e15cd6d7-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>B</i></p>
<p id="e15cd6d8-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1961, Florida’s Legislature passed the Beach and Shore Preservation Act, 1961 Fla. Laws ch. 61-246, as amended, Fla. Stat. §§161.011-161.45 (2007). The Act establishes procedures for “beach restoration and nourishment projects,” §161.088, designed to deposit sand on eroded beaches (restoration) and to maintain the deposited sand (nourishment). A local government may apply to the Department of Environmental Protection for the funds and the necessary permits to restore a beach. When the project involves placing fill on the State’s submerged lands, authorization is required from the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund, which holds title to those lands.</p>
<p id="e15cd6d9-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once a beach restoration “is determined to be undertaken,” the Board sets what is called “an erosion control line.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10AD8_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10AD8_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">16</a></span> It must be set by reference to the existing mean high-water line, though in theory it can be located seaward or landward of that. Much of the project work occurs seaward of the erosion-control line, as sand is dumped on what was once submerged land. The fixed erosion-control line replaces the fluctuating mean high-water line as the boundary between privately owned littoral property and state property. Once the erosion-control line is recorded, the common law ceases to increase upland property by accretion (or decrease it by erosion). Thus, when accretion to the shore moves the mean high-water line seaward, the property of beachfront landowners is not extended to that line (as the prior law provided), but remains bounded by the permanent erosion-control line. Those landowners “continue to be entitled,” however, “to all common-law riparian rights” other than the right to accretions. If the beach erodes back landward of the erosion-control line over a substantial portion of the shoreline covered by the project, the Board may, on its own initiative, or must, if asked by the owners or lessees of a majority of the property affected, direct the agency responsible for maintaining the beach to return the beach to the condition contemplated by the project. If that is not done within a year, the project is canceled and the erosion-control line is null and void. Finally, by regulation, if the use of submerged land would “unreasonably infringe on riparian rights,” the project cannot proceed unless the local governments show that they own or have a property interest in the upland property adjacent to the project site.</p>

The project envisioned depositing along that shore sand dredged from further out. It would add about 75 feet of dry sand seaward of the mean high-water line (to be denominated the erosion-control line). The Department issued a notice of intent to award the permits, and the Board approved the erosion-control line.</p>
<p id="e15cfcf0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The petitioner here, Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc., is a nonprofit corporation formed by people who own beachfront property bordering the project area (we shall refer to them as the Members). It brought an administrative challenge to the proposed project, which was unsuccessful; the Department approved the permits. Petitioner then challenged that action in state court under the Florida Administrative Procedure Act. The District Court of Appeal for the First District concluded that, contrary to the Act’s preservation of “all common-law riparian rights,” the order had eliminated two of the Members’ littoral rights: (1) the right to receive accretions to their property; and (2) the right to have the contact of their property with the water remain intact. This, it believed, would be an unconstitutional taking, which would “unreasonably infringe on riparian rights,” . . . and therefore require the showing . . . that the local governments owned or had a property interest in the upland property. It set aside the Department’s final order approving the permits and remanded for that showing to be made. It also certified to the Florida Supreme Court the following question (as rephrased by the latter court):</p>

It faulted the Court of Appeal for not considering the doctrine of avulsion, which it concluded permitted the State to reclaim the restored beach on behalf of the public. It described the right to accretions as a future contingent interest, not a vested property right, and held that there is no littoral right to contact with the water independent of the littoral right of access, which the Act does not infringe.

<p id="e15cfcf6-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before coming to the parties’ arguments in the present case, we discuss some general principles of our takings jurisprudence. The Takings Clause—“nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation,” U.S. Const., Amdt. 5—applies as fully to the taking of a landowner’s riparian rights as it does to the taking of an estate in land. Moreover, though the classic taking is a transfer of property to the State or to another private party by eminent domain, the Takings Clause applies to other state actions that achieve the same thing. Thus, when the government uses its own property in such a way that it destroys private property, it has taken that property. Similarly, our doctrine of regulatory takings “aims to identify regulatory actions that are functionally equivalent to the classic taking.” Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., 544 U.S. 528, 539 (2005). Thus, it is a taking when a state regulation forces a property owner to submit to a permanent physical occupation, Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 425-426 (1982), or deprives him of all economically beneficial use of his property, Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 1019. Finally (and here we approach the situation before us), States effect a taking if they recharacterize as public property what was previously private property. See Webb’s Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U.S. 155, 163-165 (1980).</p>
<p id="e15cfcf7-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Takings Clause . . . is not addressed to the action of a specific branch or branches. It is concerned simply with the act, and not with the governmental actor (“nor shall private property be taken” (emphasis added)). There is no textual justification for saying that the existence or the scope of a State’s power to expropriate private property without just compensation varies according to the branch of government effecting the expropriation. Nor does common sense recommend such a principle. It would be absurd to allow a State to do by judicial decree what the Takings Clause forbids it to do by legislative fiat. . . . </p>
<p id="e15cfcf8-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, the Takings Clause bars the State from taking private property without paying for it, no matter which branch is the instrument of the taking. To be sure, the manner of state action may matter: Condemnation by eminent domain, for example, <span title="681" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-681">p. 681</span>is always a taking, while a legislative, executive, or judicial restriction of property use may or may not be, depending on its nature and extent. But the particular state actor is irrelevant. If a legislature or a court declares that what was once an established right of private property no longer exists, it has taken that property, no less than if the State had physically appropriated it or destroyed its value by regulation. “[A] State, by <i>ipse dixit</i>, may not transform private property into public property without compensation.” [<i>Webb’s Fabulous Pharmacies</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 164.].</p>

<p id="e15d240a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Breyer’s concurrence says that we need neither (1) to decide whether the judiciary can ever effect a taking, nor (2) to establish the standard for determining whether it has done so. The second part of this is surely incompatible with Justice Breyer’s conclusion that the “Florida Supreme Court’s decision in this case did not amount to a ‘judicial taking.’ ” One cannot know whether a takings claim is invalid without knowing what standard it has failed to meet.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10B39_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10B39_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">18</a></span> Which means that Justice Breyer must either (a) grapple with the artificial question of what would constitute a judicial taking if there were such a thing as a judicial taking (reminiscent of the perplexing question how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?), or (b) answer in the negative what he considers to be the “unnecessary” constitutional question whether there is such a thing as a judicial taking. . . . </p>
<p id="e15d240c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . Justice Breyer cannot decide that petitioner’s claim fails without first deciding what a valid claim would consist of. His agreement with Part IV of our opinion necessarily implies agreement with the test for a judicial taking (elaborated in Part II-A) which Part IV applies: whether the state court has “declare[d] that what was once an established right of private property no longer exists,” Justice Breyer must either agree with that standard or craft one of his own. And agreeing to or crafting a hypothetical standard for a hypothetical constitutional right is sufficiently unappealing (we have eschewed that course many times in the past) that Justice Breyer might as well acknowledge the right as well. Or he could avoid the need to agree with or craft a hypothetical standard by denying the right. But embracing a standard while being coy about the right is, well, odd; and deciding this case while addressing neither the standard nor the right is quite impossible. . . . </p>

<p id="e15d240e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Like Justice Breyer’s concurrence, Justice Kennedy’s concludes that the Florida Supreme Court’s action here does not meet the standard for a judicial taking, while purporting not to determine what is the standard for a judicial taking, or indeed whether such a thing as a judicial taking even exists. That approach is invalid for the reasons we have discussed.</p>
<p id="e15d240f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Kennedy says that we need not take what he considers the bold and risky step of holding that the Takings Clause applies to judicial action, because the Due Process Clause “would likely prevent a State from doing by judicial decree what the Takings Clause forbids it to do by legislative fiat.” He invokes the Due Process Clause “in both its substantive and procedural aspects,” not specifying which of his arguments relates to which. . . . </p>
<span title="682" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-682">p. 682</span>
<p id="e15d2410-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . This Court has held that the separation-of-powers principles that the Constitution imposes upon the Federal Government do not apply against the States. But in order to avoid the bold and risky step of saying that the Takings Clause applies to all government takings, Justice Kennedy would have us use Procedural Due Process to impose judicially crafted separation-of-powers limitations upon the States: courts cannot be used to perform the governmental function of expropriation. The asserted reasons for the due-process limitation are that the legislative and executive branches “are accountable in their political capacity” for takings, and “[c]ourts . . . are not designed to make policy decisions” about takings. These reasons may have a lot to do with sound separation-of-powers principles that ought to govern a democratic society, but they have nothing whatever to do with the protection of individual rights that is the object of the Due Process Clause.</p>
<p id="e15d2411-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course even taking those reasons at face value, it is strange to proclaim a democracy deficit and lack of special competence for the judicial taking of an individual property right, when this Court has had no trouble deciding matters of much greater moment, contrary to congressional desire or the legislated desires of most of the States, with no special competence except the authority we possess to enforce the Constitution. In any case, our opinion does not trust judges with the relatively small power Justice Kennedy now objects to. It is we who propose setting aside judicial decisions that take private property; it is he who insists that judges cannot be so limited. Under his regime, the citizen whose property has been judicially redefined to belong to the State would presumably be given the Orwellian explanation: “The court did not take your property. Because it is neither politically accountable nor competent to make such a decision, it cannot take property.” . . . </p>
<p id="e15d2412-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first problem with using Substantive Due Process to do the work of the Takings Clause is that we have held it cannot be done. “Where a particular Amendment ‘provides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection’ against a particular sort of government behavior, ‘that Amendment, not the more generalized notion of “substantive due process,” must be the guide for analyzing these claims.’ ” Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 273 (1994) (four-Justice plurality opinion). The second problem is that we have held for many years (logically or not) that the “liberties” protected by Substantive Due Process do not include economic liberties. See, e.g., Lincoln Fed. Labor Union v. Northwestern Iron &amp; Metal Co., 335 U.S. 525, 536 (1949). Justice Kennedy’s language (“If a judicial decision . . . eliminates an established property right, the judgment could be set aside as a deprivation of property without due process of law”) propels us back to what is referred to (usually deprecatingly) as “the <i>Lochner</i> era.” That is a step of much greater novelty, and much more unpredictable effect, than merely applying the Takings Clause to judicial action. And the third and last problem with using Substantive Due Process is that either (1) it will not do all that the Takings Clause does, or (2) if it does all that the Takings Clause does, it will encounter the same supposed difficulties that Justice Kennedy finds troublesome.</p>
<p id="e15d2413-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not grasp the relevance of Justice Kennedy’s speculation that the Framers did not envision the Takings Clause would apply to judicial action. They doubtless did not, since the Constitution was adopted in an era when courts had no power to “change” the common law. Where the text they adopted is clear, however (“nor shall private property be taken for public use”), what counts is not what they envisioned but what they wrote. Of course even after courts, in the 19th century, did assume the power to change the common law, it is not true that the new “common-law <span title="683" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-683">p. 683</span>tradition . . . allows for incremental modifications to property law,” so that “owners may reasonably expect or anticipate courts to make certain changes in property law.” In the only sense in which this could be relevant to what we are discussing, that is an astounding statement. We are talking here about judicial elimination of established private property rights. If that is indeed a “common-law tradition,” Justice Kennedy ought to be able to provide a more solid example for it than the only one he cites, a state-court change (from “noxious” to “harmful”) of the test for determining whether a neighbor’s vegetation is a tortious nuisance. Fancher v. Fagella, 650 S.E.2d 519, 522 (2007). But perhaps he does not really mean that it is a common-law tradition to eliminate property rights, since he immediately follows his statement that “owners may reasonably expect or anticipate courts to make certain changes in property law” with the contradictory statement that “courts cannot abandon settled principles.” If no “settled principl[e]” has been abandoned, it is hard to see how property law could have been “change[d],” rather than merely clarified.</p>
<p id="e15d2414-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Kennedy has added “two additional practical considerations that the Court would need to address before recognizing judicial takings.” One of them is simple and simply answered: the assertion that “it is unclear what remedy a reviewing court could enter after finding a judicial taking.” Justice Kennedy worries that we may only be able to mandate compensation. That remedy is even rare for a legislative or executive taking, and we see no reason why it would be the exclusive remedy for a judicial taking. If we were to hold that the Florida Supreme Court had effected an uncompensated taking in the present case, we would simply reverse the Florida Supreme Court’s judgment that the Beach and Shore Preservation Act can be applied to the property in question. Justice Kennedy’s other point—that we will have to decide when the claim of a judicial taking must be asserted—hardly presents an awe-inspiring prospect. These, and all the other “difficulties,” “difficult questions,” and “practical considerations” that Justice Kennedy worries may perhaps stand in the way of recognizing a judicial taking, are either nonexistent or insignificant.</p>
<p id="e15d2415-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, we cannot avoid comment upon Justice Kennedy’s donning of the mantle of judicial restraint—his assertion that it is we, and not he, who would empower the courts and encourage their expropriation of private property. He warns that if judges know that their action is covered by the Takings Clause, they will issue “sweeping new rule[s] to adjust the rights of property owners,” comfortable in the knowledge that their innovations will be preserved upon payment by the State. That is quite impossible. As we have said, if we were to hold that the Florida Supreme Court had effected an uncompensated taking in this case, we would not validate the taking by ordering Florida to pay compensation. We would simply reverse the Florida Supreme Court’s judgment that the Beach and Shore Preservation Act can be applied to the Members’ property. The power to effect a compensated taking would then reside, where it has always resided, not in the Florida Supreme Court but in the Florida Legislature—which could either provide compensation or acquiesce in the invalidity of the offending features of the Act. The only realistic incentive that subjection to the Takings Clause might provide to any court would be the incentive to get reversed, which in our experience few judges value. . . . </p>
<p id="e15d4b26-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[M]ore importantly, Justice Kennedy places no constraints whatever upon this Court. Not only does his concurrence only think about applying Substantive Due Process; but because Substantive Due Process is such a wonderfully malleable concept, even a firm commitment to apply it would be a firm commitment to nothing <span title="684" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-684">p. 684</span>in particular. Justice Kennedy’s desire to substitute Substantive Due Process for the Takings Clause suggests, and the rest of what he writes confirms, that what holds him back from giving the Takings Clause its natural meaning is not the <i>intrusiveness</i> of applying it to judicial action, but the <i>definiteness</i> of doing so; not a concern to preserve the powers of the States’ political branches, but a concern to preserve this Court’s discretion to say that property may be taken, or may not be taken, as in the Court’s view the circumstances suggest. We must not say that we are bound by the Constitution never to sanction judicial elimination of clearly established property rights. Where the power of this Court is concerned, one must <i>never</i> say never. The great attraction of Substantive Due Process as a substitute for more specific constitutional guarantees is that it never means never—because it never means anything precise.</p>
<p id="e15d4b27-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>III.</b></p>
<p id="e15d4b28-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents put forward a number of arguments which contradict, to a greater or lesser degree, the principle discussed above, that the existence of a taking does not depend upon the branch of government that effects it. First, in a case claiming a judicial taking they would add to our normal takings inquiry a requirement that the court’s decision have no “fair and substantial basis.” This is taken from our jurisprudence dealing with the question whether a state-court decision rests upon adequate and independent state grounds, placing it beyond our jurisdiction to review. To assure that there is no “evasion” of our authority to review federal questions, we insist that the nonfederal ground of decision have “fair support.” A test designed to determine whether there has been an evasion is not obviously appropriate for determining whether there has been a taking of property. But if it is to be extended there it must mean (in the present context) that there is a “fair and substantial basis” for believing that petitioner’s Members did not have a property right to future accretions which the Act would take away. This is no different, we think, from our requirement that petitioners’ Members must prove the elimination of an established property right.</p>
<p id="e15d4b29-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Next, respondents argue that federal courts lack the knowledge of state law required to decide whether a judicial decision that purports merely to clarify property rights has instead taken them. But federal courts must often decide what state property rights exist in nontakings contexts, see, e.g., Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577-578 (1972) (Due Process Clause). And indeed they must decide it to resolve claims that legislative or executive action has effected a taking. For example, a regulation that deprives a property owner of all economically beneficial use of his property is not a taking if the restriction “inhere[s] in the title itself, in the restrictions that background principles of the State’s law of property and nuisance already place upon land ownership.” <i>Lucas</i>, 505 U.S., at 1029. A constitutional provision that forbids the uncompensated taking of property is quite simply insusceptible of enforcement by federal courts unless they have the power to decide what property rights exist under state law.</p>
<p id="e15d4b2a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents also warn us against depriving common-law judging of needed flexibility. That argument has little appeal when directed against the enforcement of a constitutional guarantee adopted in an era when . . . courts had no power to “change” the common law. But in any case, courts have no peculiar need of flexibility. It is no more essential that judges be free to overrule prior cases that establish property entitlements than that state legislators be free to revise pre-existing statutes that confer property entitlements, or agency-heads pre-existing regulations that do so. And insofar as courts <span title="685" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-685">p. 685</span>merely clarify and elaborate property entitlements that were previously unclear, they cannot be said to have taken an established property right.</p>
<p id="e15d4b2b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the city and county argue that applying the Takings Clause to judicial decisions would force lower federal courts to review final state-court judgments, in violation of the so-called <i>Rooker</i><i>-</i><i>Feldman</i> doctrine. See Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413, 415-416 (1923); District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462, 476 (1983). That does not necessarily follow. The finality principles that we regularly apply to takings claims, see Williamson County Regional Planning Comm’n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U.S. 172, 186-194 (1985), would require the claimant to appeal a claimed taking by a lower court to the state supreme court, whence certiorari would come to this Court. If certiorari were denied, the claimant would no more be able to launch a lower-court federal suit against the taking effected by the state supreme-court opinion than he would be able to launch such a suit against a legislative or executive taking approved by the state supreme-court opinion; the matter would be res judicata. And where the claimant was not a party to the original suit, he would be able to challenge in federal court the taking effected by the state supreme-court opinion to the same extent that he would be able to challenge in federal court a legislative or executive taking previously approved by a state supreme-court opinion.</p>
<p id="e15d4b2c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For its part, petitioner proposes an unpredictability test. Quoting Justice Stewart’s concurrence in Hughes v. Washington, 389 U.S. 290, 296 (1967), petitioner argues that a judicial taking consists of a decision that “ ‘constitutes a sudden change in state law, unpredictable in terms of relevant precedents.’ ” The focus of petitioner’s test is misdirected. What counts is not whether there is precedent for the allegedly confiscatory decision, but whether the property right allegedly taken was established. A “predictability of change” test would cover both too much and too little. Too much, because a judicial property decision need not be predictable, so long as it does not declare that what had been private property under established law no longer is. A decision that clarifies property entitlements (or the lack thereof) that were previously unclear might be difficult to predict, but it does not eliminate established property rights. And the predictability test covers too little, because a judicial elimination of established private-property rights that is foreshadowed by dicta or even by holdings years in advance is nonetheless a taking. If, for example, a state court held in one case, to which the complaining property owner was not a party, that it had the power to limit the acreage of privately owned real estate to 100 acres, and then, in a second case, applied that principle to declare the complainant’s 101st acre to be public property, the State would have taken an acre from the complainant even though the decision was predictable.</p>
<p id="e15d4b2d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>IV.</b></p>
<p id="e15d4b2e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We come at last to petitioner’s takings attack on the decision below. . . . </p>
<p id="e15d4b2f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner argues that the Florida Supreme Court took two of the property rights of the Members by declaring that those rights did not exist: the right to accretions, and the right to have littoral property touch the water (which petitioner distinguishes from the mere right of access to the water). Under petitioner’s theory, because no prior Florida decision had said that the State’s filling of submerged tidal lands could have the effect of depriving a littoral owner of contact with the water and denying him future accretions, the Florida Supreme Court’s judgment in the present case abolished those <span title="686" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-686">p. 686</span>two easements to which littoral property owners had been entitled. This puts the burden on the wrong party. There is no taking unless petitioner can show that, before the Florida Supreme Court’s decision, littoral-property owners had rights to future accretions and contact with the water superior to the State’s right to fill in its submerged land. Though some may think the question close, in our view the showing cannot be made.</p>
<p id="e15d4b30-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two core principles of Florida property law intersect in this case. First, the State as owner of the submerged land adjacent to littoral property has the right to fill that land, so long as it does not interfere with the rights of the public and the rights of littoral landowners. See Hayes v. Bowman, 91 So. 2d 795, 799-800 (Fla. 1957) (right to fill conveyed by State to private party); 102 So. 336, 341 (1924) (same). Second, . . . if an avulsion exposes land seaward of littoral property that had previously been submerged, that land belongs to the State even if it interrupts the littoral owner’s contact with the water. See <i>Bryant</i>, 238 So. 2d, at 837, 838-839. The issue here is whether there is an exception to this rule when the State is the cause of the avulsion. Prior law suggests there is not. . . . This is not surprising, as there can be no accretions to land that no longer abuts the water.</p>
<p id="e15d4b31-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, Florida law as it stood before the decision below allowed the State to fill in its own seabed, and the resulting sudden exposure of previously submerged land was treated like an avulsion for purposes of ownership. The right to accretions was therefore subordinate to the State’s right to fill. . . . </p>
<p id="e15d4b32-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Florida Supreme Court decision before us is consistent with these background principles of state property law. It did not abolish the Members’ right to future accretions, but merely held that the right was not implicated by the beach-restoration project, because the doctrine of avulsion applied. The Florida Supreme Court’s opinion describes beach restoration as the reclamation by the State of the public’s land. . . . </p>
<p id="e15d7243-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The result under Florida law may seem counter-intuitive. After all, the Members’ property has been deprived of its character (and value) as oceanfront property by the State’s artificial creation of an avulsion. Perhaps state-created avulsions ought to be treated differently from other avulsions insofar as the property right to accretion is concerned. But nothing in prior Florida law makes such a distinction. . . . We cannot say that the Florida Supreme Court’s decision eliminated a right of accretion established under Florida law.</p>
<p id="e15d7244-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner also contends that the State took the Members’ littoral right to have their property continually maintain contact with the water. To be clear, petitioner does not allege that the State relocated the property line, as would have happened if the erosion-control line were landward of the old mean high-water line (instead of identical to it). Petitioner argues instead that the Members have a separate right for the boundary of their property to be always the mean high-water line. . . . Petitioner’s expansive interpretation of the dictum in <i>Sand Key</i> would cause it to contradict the clear Florida law governing avulsion. One cannot say that the Florida Supreme Court contravened established property law by rejecting it.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BCF_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10BCF_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">19</a></span></p>

<p id="e15d7249-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">K<span class="epub-small-caps">ENNEDY</span> J., with whom S<span class="epub-small-caps">OTOMAYOR</span>, J., joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. The Court’s analysis of the principles that control ownership of the land in question, and of the rights of petitioner’s members as adjacent owners, is correct in my view, leading to my joining Parts I, IV, and V of the Court’s opinion. As Justice Breyer observes, however, this case does not require the Court to determine whether, or when, a judicial decision determining the rights of property owners can violate the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. . . . </p>
<p id="e15d724a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Takings Clause is an essential part of the constitutional structure, for it protects private property from expropriation without just compensation; and the right to own and hold property is necessary to the exercise and preservation of freedom. . . . </p>
<p id="e15d724b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The right of the property owner is subject, however, to the rule that the government does have power to take property for a public use, provided that it pays just compensation. This is a vast governmental power. And typically, legislative bodies grant substantial discretion to executive officers to decide what property can be taken for authorized projects and uses. As a result, if an authorized executive agency or official decides that Blackacre is the right place for a fire station or Greenacre is the best spot for a freeway interchange, then the weight and authority of the State are used to take the property, even against the wishes of the owner, who must be satisfied with just compensation.</p>
<p id="e15d724c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]hese are matters for the political branches—the legislature and the executive—not the courts.</p>
<p id="e15d724d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If a judicial decision, as opposed to an act of the executive or the legislature, eliminates an established property right, the judgment could be set aside as a deprivation of property without due process of law. The Due Process Clause, in both its substantive and procedural aspects, is a central limitation upon the exercise of judicial power. And this Court has long recognized that property regulations can be invalidated under the Due Process Clause. It is thus natural to read the Due Process Clause as limiting the power of courts to eliminate or change established property rights.</p>
<p id="e15d724e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . Unlike the Due Process Clause . . . the Takings Clause implicitly recognizes a governmental power while placing limits upon that power. Thus, if the Court were to hold that a judicial taking exists, it would presuppose that a judicial decision eliminating established property rights is “otherwise constitutional” so long as the State compensates the aggrieved property owners. There is no clear authority for this proposition. . . . </p>
<p id="e15d724f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court would be on strong footing in ruling that a judicial decision that eliminates or substantially changes established property rights, which are a legitimate expectation of the owner, is “arbitrary or irrational” under the Due Process Clause. Thus, without a judicial takings doctrine, the Due Process Clause would likely prevent a State from doing “by judicial decree what the Takings Clause forbids it to do by legislative fiat.” The objection that a due process claim might involve close questions concerning whether a judicial decree extends beyond what owners might have expected is not a sound argument; for the same close questions would arise with respect to whether a judicial decision is a taking.</p>

<p id="e15d7250-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . [W]ere this Court to say that judicial decisions become takings when they overreach, this might give more power to courts, not less.</p>
<p id="e15d7251-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider the instance of litigation between two property owners to determine which one bears the liability and costs when a tree that stands on one property extends its roots in a way that damages adjacent property. If a court deems that, in light of increasing urbanization, the former rule for allocation of these costs should be changed, thus shifting the rights of the owners, it may well increase the value of one property and decrease the value of the other. This might be the type of incremental modification under state common law that does not violate due process, as owners may reasonably expect or anticipate courts to make certain changes in property law. The usual due process constraint is that courts cannot abandon settled principles.</p>
<p id="e15d7252-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But if the state court were deemed to be exercising the power to take property, that constraint would be removed. Because the State would be bound to pay owners for takings caused by a judicial decision, it is conceivable that some judges might decide that enacting a sweeping new rule to adjust the rights of property owners in the context of changing social needs is a good idea. Knowing that the resulting ruling would be a taking, the courts could go ahead with their project, free from constraints that would otherwise confine their power. The resulting judgment as between the property owners likely could not be set aside by some later enactment. . . . </p>
<p id="e15d9963-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The idea, then, that a judicial takings doctrine would constrain judges might just well have the opposite effect. It would give judges new power and new assurance that changes in property rights that are beneficial, or thought to be so, are fair and proper because just compensation will be paid. The judiciary historically has not had the right or responsibility to say what property should or should not be taken.</p>
<p id="e15d9964-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Indeed, it is unclear whether the Takings Clause was understood, as a historical matter, to apply to judicial decisions. The Framers most likely viewed this Clause as applying only to physical appropriation pursuant to the power of eminent domain. And it appears these physical appropriations were traditionally made by legislatures. See 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States §1784, p. 661 (1833). Courts, on the other hand, lacked the power of eminent domain. See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 135 (W. Lewis ed. 1897). The Court’s Takings Clause jurisprudence has expanded beyond the Framers’ understanding, as it now applies to certain regulations that are not physical appropriations. But the Court should consider with care the decision to extend the Takings Clause in a manner that might be inconsistent with historical practice.</p>
<p id="e15d9965-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are two additional practical considerations that the Court would need to address before recognizing judicial takings. First, it may be unclear in certain situations how a party should properly raise a judicial takings claim. . . . </p>
<p id="e15d9966-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, it is unclear what remedy a reviewing court could enter after finding a judicial taking. It appears under our precedents that a party who suffers a taking is only entitled to damages, not equitable relief . . . . </p>
<p id="e15d9967-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is thus questionable whether reviewing courts could invalidate judicial decisions deemed to be judicial takings; they may only be able to order just compensation. . . . </p>
<p id="e15d9968-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These difficult issues are some of the reasons why the Court should not reach beyond the necessities of the case to recognize a judicial takings doctrine. . . . If and when future cases show that the usual principles, including constitutional principles that constrain the judiciary like due process, are somehow inadequate to protect property owners, then the question whether a judicial decision can effect a taking would be properly presented. In the meantime, it seems appropriate to recognize that the <span title="689" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-689">p. 689</span>substantial power to decide whose property to take and when to take it should be conceived of as a power vested in the political branches and subject to political control.</p>

I cannot join Parts II and III, however, for in those Parts the plurality unnecessarily addresses questions of constitutional law that are better left for another day.</p>
<p id="e15d996a-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . </p>
<p id="e15d996b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[I]f we were to express our views on these questions, we would invite a host of federal takings claims without the mature consideration of potential procedural or substantive legal principles that might limit federal interference in matters that are primarily the subject of state law. Property owners litigate many thousands of cases involving state property law in state courts each year. Each state-court property decision may further affect numerous nonparty property owners as well. Losing parties in many state-court cases may well believe that erroneous judicial decisions have deprived them of property rights they previously held and may consequently bring federal takings claims. And a glance at Part IV makes clear that such cases can involve state property law issues of considerable complexity. Hence, the approach the plurality would take today threatens to open the federal court doors to constitutional review of many, perhaps large numbers of, state-law cases in an area of law familiar to state, but not federal, judges. And the failure of that approach to set forth procedural limitations or canons of deference would create the distinct possibility that federal judges would play a major role in the shaping of a matter of significant state interest–state property law.</p>
<p id="e15d996c-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plurality criticizes me for my cautious approach, and states that I “cannot decide that petitioner’s claim fails without first deciding what a valid claim would consist of.” But, of course, courts frequently find it possible to resolve cases—even those raising constitutional questions—without specifying the precise standard under which a party wins or loses. That is simply what I would do here.</p>
<p id="e15d996d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the past, Members of this Court have warned us that, when faced with difficult constitutional questions, we should “confine ourselves to deciding only what is necessary to the disposition of the immediate case.” Whitehouse v. Illinois Central R. Co., 349 U.S. 366, 373 (1955); I heed this advice here. There is no need now to decide more than what the Court decides in Parts IV and V, namely, that the Florida Supreme Court’s decision in this case did not amount to a “judicial taking.”</p>

<p id="e15d9970-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>What was decided?</i></b> What did the Court actually decide in <i>Stop the Beach</i>? Did the Court finally answer the question of whether a state or federal judicial action could be a taking of property under the Takings Clause? What was the basis for the Court’s decision that the petitioners should lose?</p>
<p id="e15d9971-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>The plurality opinion.</i></b> Perhaps the most widely discussed aspect of the case is the plurality opinion, authored by Justice Scalia. A key point of disagreement between him and Justice Kennedy concerns the relevant clause of the Constitution for addressing claims involving changes of state law that affect property rights. Justice Scalia says it is the Takings Clause; Justice Kennedy argues that the <span title="690" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-690">p. 690</span>Due Process Clause is the appropriate clause. In thinking about this disagreement, consider Justice Kennedy’s argument: if an institution has no constitutional authority to take property by eminent domain, then there is no need for a doctrine that keeps it from using the police power to effect a taking by eminent domain. What do you make of this argument?</p>
<p id="e15dc082-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A second point of disagreement between Justices Scalia and Kennedy concerned the appropriate standard of review for determining whether a state court has changed the law in a proscribed manner. The plurality opinion implies that the Court should undertake de novo review to determine whether the state court has, by changing the law, eliminated an established property right. Justice Kennedy (and Justice Breyer) seem to favor a more deferential approach, something like the more traditional “fair or substantial basis” test for permitting a federal court to disregard a state court’s determination of its own law. In evaluating Scalia’s view, consider the following: Justice Scalia has long been an advocate of the view that what counts as property for constitutional purposes is a matter of state law (see, e.g., <i>Lucas</i>, supra, at 1016, 1027-1030). Perhaps the state should have full discretion to decide what rights are protected by property law and what rights are not, but once the state has decided that a property interest exists its ability to take that right away should be limited. From that perspective, the question becomes, who—state actors or federal courts—should do the sorting between established property rights and interests not established as property rights? Should not state courts, which, after all, have been given the power to determine the existence and content of property rights? See Laura S. Underkuffler, Symposium: <i>Stop the Beach Renourishment v. Florida Department of Environmental Protection</i>: Judicial Takings: A Medley of Misconceptions, 61 Syracuse L. Rev. 203 (2011).</p>

Not every physical <i>invasion</i> is a taking. As PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74 (1980), Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 U.S. 164 (1979), and the intermittent flooding cases reveal, such temporary limitations are subject to a more complex balancing process to determine whether they are a taking. The rationale is evident: they do not absolutely dispossess the owner of his rights to use, and exclude others from, his property.</p>
<p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e15b7696-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f">The dissent objects that the distinction between a permanent physical occupation and a temporary invasion will not always be clear. This objection is overstated, and in any event is irrelevant to the critical point that a permanent physical occupation <i>is</i> unquestionably a taking. . . . </p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e15b769f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10685_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" id="note-N10685_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">2</a></span>&nbsp;It is constitutionally irrelevant whether appellant (or her predecessor in title) had previously occupied this space, since a “landowner owns at least as much of the space above the ground as he can occupy or use in connection with the land.” United States v.

<p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e15b76a0-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f">The dissent asserts that a taking of about one-eighth of a cubic foot of space is not of constitutional significance. The assertion appears to be factually incorrect, since it ignores the two large silver boxes that appellant identified as part of the installation. Although the record does not reveal their size, appellant states that they are approximately 18” × 12” × 6”, and appellees do not dispute this statement. The displaced volume, then, is in excess of 1 1/2 cubic feet. In any event, these facts are not critical; whether the installation is a taking does not depend on whether the volume of space it occupies is bigger than a breadbox.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e15b76a3-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10696_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" id="note-N10696_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">3</a></span>&nbsp;It is true that the landlord could avoid the requirements of §828 by ceasing to rent the building to tenants. But a landlord’s ability to rent his property may not be conditioned on his forfeiting the right to compensation for a physical occupation. . . . </p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e15b76a5-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN106A4_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" id="note-N106A4_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">4</a></span>&nbsp;If §828 required landlords to provide cable installation if a tenant so desires, the statute might present a different question from the question before us, since the landlord would own the installation. Ownership would give the landlord rights to the placement, manner, use, and possibly the disposition of the installation. The fact of ownership is, contrary to the dissent, not simply “incidental”; it would give a landlord (rather than a CATV company) full authority over the installation except only as government specifically limited that authority. The <i>landlord</i> would decide how to comply with applicable government regulations concerning CATV and therefore could minimize the physical, esthetic, and other effects of the installation. Moreover, if the landlord wished to repair, demolish, or construct in the area of the building where the installation is located, he need not incur the burden of obtaining the CATV company’s cooperation in moving the cable.</p>
<p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e15b76a6-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f">In this case, by contrast, appellant suffered injury that might have been obviated if she had owned the cable and could exercise control over its installation. The drilling and stapling that accompanied installation apparently caused physical damage to appellant’s building. Appellant, who resides in the building, further testified that the cable installation is “ugly.” Although §828 provides that a landlord may require “reasonable” conditions that are “necessary” to protect the appearance of the premises and may seek indemnity for damage, these provisions are somewhat limited. Even if the provisions are effective, the inconvenience to the landlord of initiating the repairs remains a cognizable burden.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e15b9dc1-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN106EB_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" id="note-N106EB_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">5</a></span>&nbsp;See, e.g., N.Y.

When, for example, a regulation requires a developer to leave 90% of a rural tract in its natural state, it is unclear whether we would analyze the situation as one in which the owner has been deprived of all economically beneficial use of the burdened portion of the tract, or as one in which the owner has suffered a mere diminution in value of the tract as a whole. (For an extreme—and, we think, unsupportable—view of the relevant calculus, see Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, 42 N.Y.2d 324, 333-334, 397 N.Y.S.2d 914, 920, 366 N.E.2d 1271, 1276-1277 (1977), aff’d, 438 U.S. 104 (1978), where the state court examined the diminution in a particular parcel’s value produced by a municipal ordinance in light of total value of the taking claimant’s other holdings in the vicinity.) Unsurprisingly, this uncertainty regarding the composition of the denominator in our “deprivation” fraction has produced inconsistent pronouncements by the Court. Compare Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393, 414 (1922) (law restricting subsurface extraction of coal held to effect a taking), with Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470, 497-502 (1987) (nearly identical law held not to effect a taking); see also id., at 515-520 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting); Rose, <i>Mahon</i> Reconstructed: Why the Takings Issue is Still a Muddle, 57 S. Cal. L. Rev. 561, 566-569 (1984). The answer to this difficult question may lie in how the owner’s reasonable expectations have been shaped by the State’s law of property—i.e., whether and to what degree the State’s law has accorded legal recognition and protection to the particular interest in land with respect to which the takings claimant alleges a diminution in (or elimination of) value. In any event, we avoid this difficulty in the present case, since the “interest in land” that Lucas has pleaded (a fee simple interest) is an estate with a rich tradition of protection at common law, and since the South Carolina Court of Common Pleas found that the Beachfront Management Act left each of Lucas’s beachfront lots without economic value.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e15bec16-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10853_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" id="note-N10853_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">8</a></span>&nbsp;Justice Stevens criticizes the “deprivation of all economically beneficial use” rule as “wholly arbitrary,” in that “[the] landowner whose property is diminished in value 95% recovers nothing,” while the landowner who suffers a complete elimination of value “recovers the land’s full value.” This analysis errs in its assumption that the landowner whose deprivation is one step short of complete is not entitled to compensation. Such an owner might not be able to claim the benefit of our categorical formulation, but, as we have acknowledged time and again, “[t]he economic impact of the regulation on the claimant and . . . the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations” are keenly relevant to takings analysis generally. Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104 (1978). It is true that in at least <i>some</i> cases the landowner with 95% loss will get nothing, while the landowner with total loss will recover in full. But that occasional result is no more strange than the gross disparity between the landowner whose premises are taken for a highway (who recovers in full) and the landowner whose property is reduced to 5% of its former value by the highway (who recovers nothing). Takings law is full of these “all-or-nothing” situations.</p>
<p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e15bec17-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f">Justice Stevens similarly misinterprets our focus on “developmental” uses of property (the uses proscribed by the Beachfront Management Act) as betraying an “assumption that the only uses of property cognizable under the Constitution are <i>developmental</i> uses.” We make no such assumption. Though our prior takings cases evince an abiding concern for the productive use of, and economic investment in, land, there are plainly a number of noneconomic interests in land whose impairment will invite exceedingly close scrutiny under the Takings Clause. See, e.g., Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 436 (1982) (interest in excluding strangers from one’s land).</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e15bec1f-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10892_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" id="note-N10892_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">9</a></span>&nbsp;In Justice Blackmun’s view, even with respect to regulations that deprive an owner of all developmental or economically beneficial land uses, the test for required compensation is whether the legislature has recited a harm-preventing justification for its action. Since such a justification can be formulated in practically every case, this amounts to a test of whether the legislature has a stupid staff. We think the Takings Clause requires courts to do more than insist upon artful harm-preventing characterizations.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e15c1333-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN108B1_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" id="note-N108B1_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">10</a></span>&nbsp;The principal “otherwise” that we have in mind is litigation absolving the State (or private parties) of liability for the destruction of “real and personal property, in cases of actual necessity, to prevent the spreading of a fire” or to forestall other grave threats to the lives and property of others. Bowditch v. Boston, 101 U.S. 16, 18-19 (1880). . . . </p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e15c1337-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN108CD_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" id="note-N108CD_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">11</a></span>&nbsp;Justice Blackmun decries our reliance on background nuisance principles at least in part because he believes those principles to be as manipulable as we find the “harm prevention”/ “benefit conferral” dichotomy. There is no doubt some leeway in a court’s interpretation of what existing state law permits—but not remotely as much, we think, as in a legislative crafting of the reasons for its confiscatory regulation. We stress that an affirmative decree eliminating all economically beneficial uses may be defended only if an <i>objectively reasonable application</i> of relevant precedents would exclude those beneficial uses in the circumstances in which the land is presently found.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e15c3a59-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10928_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" id="note-N10928_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">12</a></span>&nbsp;Although it refers to state nuisance and property law, the Court apparently does not mean just any state nuisance and property law. Public nuisance was first a common law creation, see Newark, The Boundaries of Nuisance, 65 L.Q. Rev. 480, 482 (1949) (attributing development of nuisance to 1535), but by the 1800s in both the United States and England, legislatures had the power to define what is a public nuisance, and particular uses often have been selectively targeted. See Prosser, Private Action for Public Nuisance, 52 Va. L. Rev. 997, 999-1000 (1966); J. Stephen, A General View of the Criminal Law of England 105-107 (2d ed. 1890). The Court’s references to “common-law” background principles, however, indicate that legislative determinations do not constitute “state nuisance and property law” for the Court.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e15c3a5e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10948_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" id="note-N10948_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">13</a></span>&nbsp;”There is perhaps no more impenetrable jungle in the entire law than that which surrounds the word ‘nuisance.’ It has meant all things to all people, and has been applied indiscriminately to everything from an alarming advertisement to a cockroach baked in a pie.” W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on The Law of Torts 616 (5th ed. 1984) (footnotes omitted). . . . </p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e15c617d-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN1099F_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" id="note-N1099F_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">14</a></span>&nbsp;Of course, the same could easily be said in this case: Lucas may put his land to “other uses”—fishing or camping, for example—or may sell his land to his neighbors as a buffer. In either event, his land is far from “valueless.”</p>
<p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e15c617e-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f">This highlights a fundamental weakness in the Court’s analysis: its failure to explain why only the impairment of “<i>economically</i> beneficial or productive use” (emphasis added) of property is relevant in takings analysis. I should think that a regulation arbitrarily prohibiting an owner from continuing to use her property for bird watching or sunbathing might constitute a taking under some circumstances; and, conversely, that such uses are of value to the owner. Yet the Court offers no basis for its assumption that the only uses of property cognizable under the Constitution are <i>developmental</i> uses.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e15cd6d3-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10AB0_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" id="note-N10AB0_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">15</a></span>&nbsp;Many cases and statutes use “riparian” to mean abutting any body of water. The Florida Supreme Court, however, has adopted a more precise usage whereby “riparian” means abutting a river or stream and “littoral” means abutting an ocean, sea, or lake. Walton Cty. v. Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc., 998 So. 2d 1102, 1105, n. 3 (2008). When speaking of the Florida law applicable to this case, we follow the Florida Supreme Court’s terminology.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e15cd6da-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10AD8_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" id="note-N10AD8_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">16</a></span>&nbsp;We assume, as the parties agree we should, that in this case the erosion-control line is the pre-existing mean high-water line. Respondents concede that, if the erosion-control line were established landward of that, the State would have taken property.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e15cfcf2-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10B03_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" id="note-N10B03_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">17</a></span>&nbsp;The Florida Supreme Court seemingly took the question to refer to constitutionality under the Florida Constitution, which contains a clause similar to the Takings Clause of the Federal Constitution. Compare Fla. Const., Art. X, §6, cl. (a), with U.S. Const., Amdt. 5.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e15d240b-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10B39_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" id="note-N10B39_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">18</a></span>&nbsp;Thus, the landmark case of Penn Central Trans. Co. v. New York, 438 U.S. 104, 124-128, (1978), held that there was no taking only after setting forth a multi-factor test for determining whether a regulation restricting the use of property effects a taking.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="e15d7245-4092-11e7-a5fd-afd2224b902f"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10BCF_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e" id="note-N10BCF_5eaa8818-2ab9-11e7-b510-f14fe7f7427e">19</a></span>&nbsp;Petitioner also argues that the Members’ other littoral rights have been infringed because the Act replaces their common-law rights with inferior statutory versions. Petitioner has not established that the statutory versions are inferior; and whether the source of a property right is the common law or a statute makes no difference, so long as the property owner continues to have what he previously had.</p></div>

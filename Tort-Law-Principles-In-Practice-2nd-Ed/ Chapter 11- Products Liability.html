<p id="661cf716-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">An individual is making toast one morning when her toaster overheats and explodes. She suffers horrific skin burns. What recourse does the consumer have? Before the adoption of strict liability for defective product sellers, an injured consumer had to resort to either a claim for negligence or breach of warranty. Each theory was fraught with some peril and significant obstacles to overcome. Much of the early history of strict liability for products cases involves courts recognizing these barriers and deciding that they could no longer be tolerated. Within a few years of the California Supreme Court’s decision to offer a strict liability remedy to users of flawed products, nearly every other state followed suit based upon Restatement (Second) of Torts §402A—arguably the most influential provision in the entire Restatement of Torts. The pendulum swung far with the adoption of strict liability, sweeping aside many possible defenses otherwise available to product sellers. The law over the years has become more complex and sophisticated in terms of the proper analysis of each variety of products case. In modern strict products liability, many have begun to question whether the pendulum has <span title="740" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-740">p. 740</span>swung back the opposite direction with increasingly familiar notions of fault injected into the supposedly “absolute” theory of liability. Aside from negligence law, strict products liability might be one of the most common civil tort claims filed today. Entire elective courses in law school are frequently devoted to the intricacies in this specialty area of the law. Nevertheless, this foray into the law of strict products liability should enable you to perceive differences and similarities between this uniquely twentieth century theory of recovery and older causes of action. Product liability law continues to evolve through judicial decisions as well as legislative modifications arising out of a perceived need for tort reform. It nevertheless remains a favorite theory of recovery for many plaintiffs’ counsel.</p>

<p id="661cf71b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">At one point in time, courts uniformly applied a limited special duty rule in negligence cases that recognized a duty of care to a consumer injured by a product only if the seller was in contractual privity with the plaintiff. That is, the consumer could only assert a negligence claim against her <i>immediate seller</i> of the product. If the plaintiff bought directly from the manufacturer, she could sue if the manufacturer could be shown to be at fault. On the other hand, most consumer products are not sold directly by the manufacturer to the consumer but through wholesalers, distributors, and then retailers. Under this scenario, the only entity owing the consumer a duty of care would be the retailer from whom the plaintiff purchased the item. Unfortunately, retailers are less likely to have acted negligently than manufacturers—after all, retailers rarely exercise any control over the design or building of such goods. The retailer might also have no indication, until the plaintiff’s injury and suit, of the existence of any problem. Thus, the only one in the stream of commerce owing a duty of care toward the plaintiff would be the one least likely to be culpable of any wrongdoing. Courts increasingly desired to make it easier for consumers damaged by defective products to find recourse against sellers of such goods. This limited duty rule was a major obstacle in the path of easing restrictions on suits brought by injured consumers. A case with enormous influence in torts was decided in 1916 in an opinion written by Judge Cardozo. In the <i>MacPherson</i> case below, note how Judge Cardozo masterfully and dramatically changes the law while making it look like less than a wholesale shift in the law of torts.</p>

<p id="661d1e32-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant is a manufacturer of automobiles. It sold an automobile to a retail dealer. The retail dealer resold to the plaintiff. While the plaintiff was in the car, it suddenly collapsed. He was thrown out and injured. One of the wheels was made of defective wood, and its spokes crumbled into fragments. The wheel was not made by the defendant; it was bought from another manufacturer. There is evidence, however, that its defects could have been discovered by reasonable inspection, and that inspection was omitted. There is no claim that the defendant knew of the defect and willfully concealed it. The charge is one, not of fraud, but of negligence. The question to be determined is whether the defendant owed a duty of care and vigilance to any one but the immediate purchaser.</p>
<p id="661d1e33-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The foundations of this branch of the law, at least in this state, were laid in <i>Thomas v. Winchester</i> (6 N.Y. 397). A poison was falsely labeled. The sale was made to a druggist, who in turn sold to a customer. The customer recovered damages from the seller who affixed the label. “The defendant’s negligence,” it was said, “put human life in imminent danger.” A poison falsely labeled is likely to injure any one who gets it. Because the danger is to be foreseen, there is a duty to avoid the injury. Cases were cited by way of illustration in which manufacturers were not subject to any duty irrespective of contract. The distinction was said to be that their conduct, though negligent, was not likely to result in injury to any one except the purchaser. We are not required to say whether the chance of injury was always as remote as the distinction assumes. Some of the illustrations might be rejected today. The <i>principle</i> of the distinction is for present purposes the important thing.</p>
<p id="661d1e34-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Thomas v. Winchester</i> became quickly a landmark of the law. In the application of its principle there may at times have been uncertainty or even error. There has never in this state been doubt or disavowal of the principle itself. The chief cases are well known, yet to recall some of them will be helpful. <i>Loop v. Litchfield</i> (42 N.Y. 351) is the earliest. It was the case of a defect in a small balance wheel used on a circular saw. The manufacturer pointed out the defect to the buyer, who wished a cheap article and was ready to assume the risk. The risk can hardly have been an imminent one, for the wheel lasted five years before it broke. In the meanwhile the buyer had made a lease of the machinery. It was held that the manufacturer was not answerable to the lessee. <i>Loop v. Litchfield</i> was followed in <i>Losee v. Clute</i> (51 N.Y. 494), the case of the explosion of a steam boiler. That decision has been criticised (Thompson on Negligence, 233; Shearman &amp; Redfield on Negligence [6th ed.], §117); but it must be confined to its special facts. It was put upon the ground that the risk of injury was too remote. The buyer in that case had not only accepted the boiler, but had tested it. The <span title="742" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-742">p. 742</span>manufacturer knew that his own test was not the final one. The finality of the test has a bearing on the measure of diligence owing to persons other than the purchaser (Beven, Negligence [3d ed.], pp. 50, 51, 54; Wharton, Negligence [2d ed.], §134).</p>
<p id="661d1e35-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These early cases suggest a narrow construction of the rule. Later cases, however, evince a more liberal spirit. First in importance is <i>Devlin v. Smith</i> (89 N.Y. 470). The defendant, a contractor, built a scaffold for a painter. The painter’s servants were injured. The contractor was held liable. He knew that the scaffold, if improperly constructed, was a most dangerous trap. He knew that it was to be used by the workmen. He was building it for that very purpose. Building it for their use, he owed them a duty, irrespective of his contract with their master, to build it with care.</p>
<p id="661d1e36-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From <i>Devlin v. Smith</i> we pass over intermediate cases and turn to the latest case in this court in which <i>Thomas v. Winchester</i> was followed. That case is <i>Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co.</i> (195 N.Y. 478, 480). The defendant manufactured a large coffee urn. It was installed in a restaurant. When heated, the urn exploded and injured the plaintiff. We held that the manufacturer was liable. We said that the urn “was of such a character inherently that, when applied to the purposes for which it was designed, it was liable to become a source of great danger to many people if not carefully and properly constructed.”</p>
<p id="661d1e37-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It may be that <i>Devlin v. Smith</i> and <i>Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co.</i> have extended the rule of <i>Thomas v. Winchester</i>. If so, this court is committed to the extension. The defendant argues that things imminently dangerous to life are poisons, explosives, deadly weapons—things whose normal function it is to injure or destroy. But whatever the rule in <i>Thomas v. Winchester</i> may once have been, it has no longer that restricted meaning. A scaffold is not inherently a destructive instrument. It becomes destructive only if imperfectly constructed. A large coffee urn may have within itself, if negligently made, the potency of danger, yet no one thinks of it as an implement whose normal function is destruction. We are not required at this time either to approve or to disapprove the application of the rule that was made in these cases. It is enough that they help to characterize the trend of judicial thought.</p>
<p id="661d1e38-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We hold, then, that the principle of <i>Thomas v. Winchester</i> is not limited to poisons, explosives, and things of like nature, to things which in their normal operation are implements of destruction. If the nature of a thing is such that it is reasonably certain to place life and limb in peril when negligently made, it is then a thing of danger. Its nature gives warning of the consequences to be expected. If to the element of danger there is added knowledge that the thing will be used by persons other than the purchaser, and used without new tests, then, irrespective of contract, the manufacturer of this thing of danger is under a duty to make it carefully. That is as far as we are required to go for the decision of this case. There must be knowledge of a danger, not merely possible, but probable. It is <i>possible</i> to use almost anything in a way that will make it dangerous if defective. That is not enough to charge the manufacturer with a duty independent of his contract. Whether a given thing is dangerous may be sometimes a question for the court <span title="743" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-743">p. 743</span>and sometimes a question for the jury. There must also be knowledge that in the usual course of events the danger will be shared by others than the buyer. Such knowledge may often be inferred from the nature of the transaction. But it is possible that even knowledge of the danger and of the use will not always be enough. The proximity or remoteness of the relation is a factor to be considered. We are dealing now with the liability of the manufacturer of the finished product, who puts it on the market to be used without inspection by his customers. If he is negligent, where danger is to be foreseen, a liability will follow.</p>
<p id="661d1e39-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are not required at this time to say that it is legitimate to go back of the manufacturer of the finished product and hold the manufacturers of the component parts. To make their negligence a cause of imminent danger, an independent cause must often intervene; the manufacturer of the finished product must also fail in <i>his</i> duty of inspection. It may be that in those circumstances the negligence of the earlier members of the series is too remote to constitute, as to the ultimate user, an actionable wrong. We leave that question open. We shall have to deal with it when it arises. The difficulty which it suggests is not present in this case. There is here no break in the chain of cause and effect. In such circumstances, the presence of a known danger, attendant upon a known use, makes vigilance a duty. We have put aside the notion that the duty to safeguard life and limb, when the consequences of negligence may be foreseen, grows out of contract and nothing else. We have put the source of the obligation where it ought to be. We have put its source in the law.</p>
<p id="661d454a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From this survey of the decisions, there thus emerges a definition of the duty of a manufacturer, which enables us to measure this defendant’s liability. Beyond all question, the nature of an automobile gives warning of probable danger if its construction is defective. This automobile was designed to go fifty miles an hour. Unless its wheels were sound and strong, injury was almost certain. It was as much a thing of danger as a defective engine for a railroad. The defendant knew the danger. It knew also that the car would be used by persons other than the buyer. This was apparent from its size; there were seats for three persons. It was apparent also from the fact that the buyer was a dealer in cars, who bought to resell. The maker of this car supplied it for the use of purchasers from the dealer just as plainly as the contractor in <i>Devlin v. Smith</i> supplied the scaffold for use by the servants of the owner. The dealer was indeed the one person of whom it might be said with some approach to certainty that by him the car would not be used. Yet the defendant would have us say that he was the one person whom it was under a legal duty to protect. The law does not lead us to so inconsequent a conclusion. Precedents drawn from the days of travel by stage coach do not fit the conditions of travel to-day. The principle that the danger must be imminent does not change, but the things subject to the principle do change. They are whatever the needs of life in a developing civilization require them to be.</p>
<p id="661d454b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this view of the defendant’s liability there is nothing inconsistent with the theory of liability on which the case was tried. It is true that the court told the <span title="744" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-744">p. 744</span>jury that “an automobile is not an inherently dangerous vehicle.” The meaning, however, is made plain by the context. The meaning is that danger is not to be expected when the vehicle is well constructed. The court left it to the jury to say whether the defendant ought to have foreseen that the car, if negligently constructed, would become “imminently dangerous.” Subtle distinctions are drawn by the defendant between things inherently dangerous and things imminently dangerous, but the case does not turn upon these verbal niceties. If danger was to be expected as reasonably certain, there was a duty of vigilance, and this whether you call the danger inherent or imminent. In varying forms that thought was put before the jury. We do not say that the court would not have been justified in ruling as a matter of law that the car was a dangerous thing. If there was any error, it was none of which the defendant can complain.</p>
<p id="661d454c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think the defendant was not absolved from a duty of inspection because it bought the wheels from a reputable manufacturer. It was not merely a dealer in automobiles. It was a manufacturer of automobiles. It was responsible for the finished product. It was not at liberty to put the finished product on the market without subjecting the component parts to ordinary and simple tests (<i>Richmond &amp; Danville R.R. Co. v. Elliott</i>, 149 U.S. 266, 272). Under the charge of the trial judge nothing more was required of it. The obligation to inspect must vary with the nature of the thing to be inspected. The more probable the danger, the greater the need of caution. Both by its relation to the work and by the nature of its business, it is charged with a stricter duty.</p>
<p id="661d454d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judgment should be affirmed with costs.</p>

<p id="661d4550-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Eradication of Special Duty Limit</i>.</b> The plaintiff in <i>MacPherson</i> encountered a duty problem with respect to its attempted negligence claim against Buick. As an example of a special duty rule (similar to those we encountered in Chapter 6, Special Duty Rules) sellers of goods who were not in direct privity of contract with the plaintiff generally had no duty of care toward the plaintiff. Can you imagine why the law had come up with this limitation to protect remote sellers? This special duty rule was first announced in Winterbottom v. Wright, 152 Eng. Rep. 402 (1842) where the court stated that a coach driver hurt by a defect in the stagecoach he was hired to drive could not sue for negligence because he lacked privity of contract. You will recall encountering Judge Cardozo in the <i>Palsgraf</i> case, where he declared that the concept of a duty of care was premised upon a foreseeable risk of harm to the plaintiff from the defendant’s conduct. In <i>MacPherson</i>, Cardozo determined to run the historic no-duty rule for sellers of goods lacking privity of contract with victims through this crucible of foreseeability. Judge Cardozo first noted that an exception to the general no-duty rule had become the trend based upon the <span title="745" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-745">p. 745</span>foreseeability of significant harm to remote users of negligently designed and manufactured goods. How does Cardozo use this exception to establish a new rule? What are the two aspects of foreseeability that Cardozo declares are necessary to remove the privity barrier in a particular case?</p>
<p id="661d4551-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Liability of Retailer</i>.</b> Near the end of his opinion in <i>MacPherson</i>, Judge Cardozo turns his attention to the second issue of whether there was evidence of any fault against Buick. He contrasts the potential requirement for an inspection of the finished goods against a manufacturer such as Buick with the subsequent retailer of the car. He observes that Buick was “not merely a dealer in automobiles. It was a manufacturer of automobiles. It was not at liberty to put the finished product on the market without subjecting the component parts to ordinary and simple tests.” The negative implication of this observation is that an ordinary retailer, having no part in the design or manufacture of a finished good, might not have any obligation—as part of its duty of reasonable care—to inspect or test a car before selling it. This observation highlights a significant importance of the decision in <i>MacPherson</i> because, prior to this case, the only seller in the stream of commerce owing the plaintiff a duty of care was the one least likely to be found to have breached such a duty. <i>MacPherson</i> fixes this anomaly and opens the door to suits by victims against those likely to have deeper pockets than the retailer with whom the plaintiff dealt.</p>
<p id="661d4552-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Liability of Remote Component Manufacturer</i>.</b> On the other end of the stream of commerce from the retailer, Cardozo briefly speculates about the potential liability of the remote manufacturer of the defective wheel used on the Buick. While not absolving that remote seller of a duty of care, Cardozo wonders whether proximate cause will be a stumbling block for an injured consumer under his direct cause view of proximate cause: “It may be that in those circumstances the negligence of the earlier members of the series is too remote to constitute, as to the ultimate user, an actionable wrong. We leave that question open.” Do you understand why under a direct cause test for proximate cause the subsequent negligence of Buick might be considered an independent intervening cause?</p>
<p id="661d4553-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Paving the Way for Strict Liability Against Sellers.</i></b> Though Cardozo conditioned a finding of duty on Buick being able to foresee the special dangers of a negligently constructed car to users other than immediate purchasers, courts eventually quit asking these questions and began to routinely assume a <i>duty</i> on all product manufacturers owed toward any user or victim of a negligently built product. Thus, <i>Macpherson</i> paved the way toward easing one of the two major impediments toward recovery by victims of products. The <i>Escola</i> case below suggested a pathway around the other hurdle—establishing <i>fault</i>, or negligence, against a product seller.</p>

<p id="661d6c66-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">The <i>MacPherson</i> case was enormously important in terms of making manufacturers who were careless about designing or building goods accountable to remote injured consumers. But it still left intact certain other hurdles to recovery, either on a tort theory or a breach of warranty theory. In the following case of <i>Escola v. Coca Cola</i>, Justice Traynor in his famous concurring opinion proposed that courts find a new, simpler pathway toward an injured consumer’s recovery that is neither shackled with the burden of proving fault nor subject to the intricacies of the law of sales (for a warranty recovery). Although it was “just” a concurring opinion, the strength of his arguments resonated and ultimately became the basis nearly two decades later for the adoption of strict products liability. Consider the multifaceted arguments Justice Traynor gives for this proposed fundamental change in the law.</p>

<p id="661d937d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff, a waitress in a restaurant, was injured when a bottle of Coca Cola broke in her hand. She alleged that defendant company, which had bottled and delivered the alleged defective bottle to her employer, was negligent in selling “bottles containing said beverage which on account of excessive pressure of gas or by reason of some defect in the bottle was dangerous and likely to explode.” This appeal is from a judgment upon a jury verdict in favor of plaintiff.</p>
<p id="661d937e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant’s driver delivered several cases of Coca Cola to the restaurant, placing them on the floor, one on top of the other, under and behind the counter, where they remained at least thirty-six hours. Immediately before the accident, plaintiff picked up the top case and set it upon a nearby ice cream cabinet in front of and about three feet from the refrigerator. She then proceeded to take the bottles from the case with her right hand, one at a time, and put them into the refrigerator. Plaintiff testified that after she had placed three bottles in the refrigerator and had moved the fourth bottle about eighteen inches from the case “it exploded in my hand.” The bottle broke into two jagged pieces and inflicted a deep five-inch cut, severing blood vessels, nerves and muscles of the thumb and palm of the hand. Plaintiff further testified that when the bottle exploded, “It made a sound similar to an electric light bulb that would have dropped. It made a loud pop.” Plaintiff’s employer testified, “I was about twenty feet from where it actually happened and I heard the explosion.” A fellow employee, on the opposite side of the counter, testified that <span title="747" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-747">p. 747</span>plaintiff “had the bottle, I should judge, waist high, and I know that it didn’t bang either the case or the door or another bottle…when it popped. It sounded just like a fruit jar would blow up.” The witness further testified that the contents of the bottle “flew all over herself and myself and the walls and one thing and another.”</p>
<p id="661d937f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The top portion of the bottle, with the cap, remained in plaintiff’s hand, and the lower portion fell to the floor but did not break. The broken bottle was not produced at the trial, the pieces having been thrown away by an employee of the restaurant shortly after the accident. Plaintiff, however, described the broken pieces, and a diagram of the bottle was made showing the location of the “fracture line” where the bottle broke in two.</p>
<p id="661d9380-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of defendant’s drivers, called as a witness by plaintiff, testified that he had seen other bottles of Coca Cola in the past explode and had found broken bottles in the warehouse when he took the cases out, but that he did not know what made them blow up.</p>
<p id="661d9381-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff then rested her case, having announced to the court that being unable to show any specific acts of negligence, she relied completely on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.</p>
<p id="661d9382-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although it is not clear in this case whether the explosion was caused by an excessive charge or a defect in the glass, there is a sufficient showing that neither cause would ordinarily have been present if due care had been used. Further, defendant had exclusive control over both the charging and inspection of the bottles. Accordingly, all the requirements necessary to entitle plaintiff to rely on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur to supply an inference of negligence are present.</p>
<p id="661d9383-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judgment is affirmed.</p>

<p id="661d9385-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I concur in the judgment, but I believe the manufacturer’s negligence should no longer be singled out as the basis of a plaintiff’s right to recover in cases like the present one. In my opinion it should now be recognized that a manufacturer incurs an absolute liability when an article that he has placed on the market, knowing that it is to be used without inspection, proves to have a defect that causes injury to human beings. <i>McPherson v. Buick Motor Co</i>. established the principle, recognized by this court, that irrespective of privity of contract, the manufacturer is responsible for an injury caused by such an article to any person who comes in lawful contact with it. In these cases the source of the manufacturer’s liability was his negligence in the manufacturing process or in the inspection of component parts supplied by others. Even if there is no negligence, however, public policy demands that responsibility be fixed wherever it will most effectively reduce the hazards to life and health inherent in defective products that reach the market. It is evident that the manufacturer can anticipate some hazards and guard against the recurrence of others, as the public cannot. Those who suffer injury from defective products are unprepared to meet its consequences. The cost of an injury and the loss of time or health may be an <span title="748" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-748">p. 748</span>overwhelming misfortune to the person injured, and a needless one, for the risk of injury can be insured by the manufacturer and distributed among the public as a cost of doing business. It is to the public interest to discourage the marketing of products having defects that are a menace to the public. If such products nevertheless find their way into the market it is to the public interest to place the responsibility for whatever injury they may cause upon the manufacturer, who, even if he is not negligent in the manufacture of the product, is responsible for its reaching the market. However intermittently such injuries may occur and however haphazardly they may strike, the risk of their occurrence is a constant risk and a general one. Against such a risk there should be general and constant protection and the manufacturer is best situated to afford such protection.</p>
<p id="661d9386-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The injury from a defective product does not become a matter of indifference because the defect arises from causes other than the negligence of the manufacturer, such as negligence of a submanufacturer of a component part whose defects could not be revealed by inspection, or unknown causes that even by the device of res ipsa loquitur cannot be classified as negligence of the manufacturer. The inference of negligence may be dispelled by an affirmative showing of proper care. If the evidence against the fact inferred is “clear, positive, uncontradicted, and of such a nature that it cannot rationally be disbelieved, the court must instruct the jury that the nonexistence of the fact has been established as a matter of law.” (<i>Blank v. Coffin</i>, 126 P.2d 868 (Cal.)) An injured person, however, is not ordinarily in a position to refute such evidence or identify the cause of the defect, for he can hardly be familiar with the manufacturing process as the manufacturer himself is. In leaving it to the jury to decide whether the inference has been dispelled, regardless of the evidence against it, the negligence rule approaches the rule of strict liability. It is needlessly circuitous to make negligence the basis of recovery and impose what is in reality liability without negligence. If public policy demands that a manufacturer of goods be responsible for their quality regardless of negligence there is no reason not to fix that responsibility openly.</p>
<p id="661d9387-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the case of foodstuffs, the public policy of the state is formulated in a criminal statute. The statute imposes criminal liability not only if the food is adulterated, but if its container, which may be a bottle has any deleterious substance or renders the product injurious to health. The criminal liability under the statute attaches without proof of fault, so that the manufacturer is under the duty of ascertaining whether an article manufactured by him is safe. Statutes of this kind result in a strict liability of the manufacturer in tort to the member of the public injured.</p>
<p id="661d9388-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statute may well be applicable to a bottle whose defects cause it to explode. In any event it is significant that the statute imposes criminal liability without fault, reflecting the public policy of protecting the public from dangerous products placed on the market, irrespective of negligence in their manufacture. While the Legislature imposes criminal liability only with regard to food products and their containers, there are many other sources of danger. It <span title="749" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-749">p. 749</span>is to the public interest to prevent injury to the public from any defective goods by the imposition of civil liability generally.</p>
<p id="661dba99-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The retailer, even though not equipped to test a product, is under an absolute liability to his customer, for the implied warranties of fitness for proposed use and merchantable quality include a warranty of safety of the product. This warranty is not necessarily a contractual one for public policy requires that the buyer be insured at the seller’s expense against injury. The courts recognize, however, that the retailer cannot bear the burden of this warranty, and allow him to recoup any losses by means of the warranty of safety attending the wholesaler’s or manufacturer’s sale to him. Such a procedure, however, is needlessly circuitous and engenders wasteful litigation. Much would be gained if the injured person could base his action directly on the manufacturer’s warranty.</p>

</div>
<p id="661dba9e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The liability of the manufacturer to an immediate buyer injured by a defective product follows without proof of negligence from the implied warranty of safety attending the sale. Ordinarily, however, the immediate buyer is a dealer who does not intend to use the product himself, and if the warranty of safety is to serve the purpose of protecting health and safety it must give rights to others than the dealer. In the words of Judge Cardozo in the <i>McPherson</i> case: “The dealer was indeed the one person of whom it might be said with some approach to certainty that by him the car would not be used. Yet, the defendant would have us say that he was the one person whom it was under a legal duty to protect. The law does not lead us to so inconsequent a solution.” While the defendant’s negligence in the <i>McPherson</i> case made it unnecessary for the court to base liability on warranty, Judge Cardozo’s reasoning recognized the injured person as the real party in interest and effectively disposed of the theory that the liability of the manufacturer incurred by his warranty should apply only to the immediate purchaser. It thus paves the way for a standard of liability that would make the manufacturer guarantee the safety of his product even when there is no negligence.</p>
<p id="661dba9f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This court and many others have extended protection according to such a standard to consumers of food products, taking the view that the right of a consumer injured by unwholesome food does not depend “upon the intricacies of the law of sales” and that the warranty of the manufacturer to the consumer in absence of privity of contract rests on public policy. Dangers to life and health inhere in other consumers’ goods that are defective and there is no reason to differentiate them from the dangers of defective food products.</p>
<p id="661dbaa0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the food products cases the courts have resorted to various fictions to rationalize the extension of the manufacturer’s warranty to the consumer: that a <span title="750" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-750">p. 750</span>warranty runs with the chattel; that the cause of action of the dealer is assigned to the consumer; that the consumer is a third party beneficiary of the manufacturer’s contract with the dealer. They have also held the manufacturer liable on a mere fiction of negligence: “Practically he must know it [the product] is fit, or bear the consequences if it proves destructive.” Such fictions are not necessary to fix the manufacturer’s liability under a warranty if the warranty is severed from the contract of sale between the dealer and the consumer and based on the law of torts as a strict liability. Warranties are not necessarily rights arising under a contract. An action on a warranty “was, in its origin, a pure action of tort,” and only late in the historical development of warranties was an action in assumpsit allowed.</p>
<p id="661dbaa1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As handicrafts have been replaced by mass production with its great markets and transportation facilities, the close relationship between the producer and consumer of a product has been altered. Manufacturing processes, frequently valuable secrets, are ordinarily either inaccessible to or beyond the ken of the general public. The consumer no longer has means or skill enough to investigate for himself the soundness of a product, even when it is not contained in a sealed package, and his erstwhile vigilance has been lulled by the steady efforts of manufacturers to build up confidence by advertising and marketing devices such as trade-marks. Consumers no longer approach products warily but accept them on faith, relying on the reputation of the manufacturer or the trademark. Manufacturers have sought to justify that faith by increasingly high standards of inspection and a readiness to make good on defective products by way of replacements and refunds. The manufacturer’s obligation to the consumer must keep pace with the changing relationship between them; it cannot be escaped because the marketing of a product has become so complicated as to require one or more intermediaries. Certainly there is greater reason to impose liability on the manufacturer than on the retailer who is but a conduit of a product that he is not himself able to test.</p>
<p id="661dbaa2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The manufacturer’s liability should, of course, be defined in terms of the safety of the product in normal and proper use, and should not extend to injuries that cannot be traced to the product as it reached the market.</p>

Yuba Power Products, Inc., 377 P.2d 897 (Cal. 1963) formally adopting the same theory of strict liability he endorsed in <i>Escola</i> for identical reasons. In <i>Greenman</i>, a power lathe manufactured by the defendant hurt the plaintiff. One of the legal problems the plaintiff had with recovering under a warranty theory was that state law demanded that a plaintiff give a timely notice of breach of warranty to anyone he intended to pursue on a warranty theory. The plaintiff, not realizing the possible claim against the <span title="751" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-751">p. 751</span>remote manufacturer, failed to comply with this notice obligation. The court nevertheless permitted the plaintiff to recover on this new tort theory of strict liability due to the defect in the product that rendered it dangerous. The court summarized the plaintiff’s right to recover under this theory of absolute liability, as follows:</p>

Under these circumstances, it should not be controlling whether plaintiff selected the machine because of statements in [a] brochure, or because of the machine’s own appearance of excellence that belied the defect lurking beneath the surface, or because he merely assumed that it would safely do the jobs it was built to do. It should not be controlling whether the details of the sales from manufacturer to retailer and from retailer to plaintiff’s wife were such that one or more of the implied warranties of the sales act arose. To establish the manufacturer’s liability, it was sufficient that plaintiff proved that he was injured while using the [lathe] in a way it was intended to be used as a result of a defect in design and manufacture of which plaintiff was not aware that made the [lathe] unsafe for its intended use.</p>

<p id="661de1c0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How are the decisions in <i>MacPherson</i> and <i>Escola/Greenman</i> reflected by §402A? In the stream of commerce, which sellers would face strict liability under its provisions? What sorts of losses create strict liability? There has more recently been published a Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability (1998), but its provisions have not been as widely received or embraced as §402A from the Second Restatement.</p>
<span title="752" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-752">p. 752</span>
<p id="661de1c1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Liability for “Sellers” of Defective Products.</i></b> Restatement (Second) 402A establishes liability for any seller of a defective product within the stream of commerce—manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, and retailers. So long as the defendant is regularly engaged in the sale of goods, and the product is proven to have contained an unreasonably dangerous “defect” at the time the defendant sold the item, that seller is liable. In effect, the common law recognizes a joint liability for all sellers of the defective product that hurt the plaintiff. The common law also has recognized, within the stream of commerce, that there is an implied right to be indemnified by a seller further upstream from the defendant seller held liable to the plaintiff. For example, if a retailer is liable to the plaintiff for a defective good received (in that same condition) from a wholesaler, the retailer can sue the wholesaler for complete indemnification. Of course, the wholesaler can then sue the manufacturer for indemnification as well, so long as the defective condition existed when the manufacturer initially sold the product. In this way, the plaintiff has multiple sources for redress for injuries caused by defective products, and (due to the indemnity rights) the loss theoretically will be borne by the seller that was the original source of the defect. In cases where the only allegations against various sellers involve their conduct in selling the defective good (as contrasted with some other act of negligence), there is no reason to have the jury apportion fault among the sellers. If there is any apportionment question, there would simply be a line item for the product itself. The percentage fault attributed to the product would create a joint liability for the sellers of the product (much like vicarious liability creates a joint liability for both employee and employer). Of course, in reality, the ultimate economic loss likely is not left on the shoulders of even the manufacturer. As Justice Traynor argued in <i>Escola</i>, manufacturers can pass on such losses to the consumers of their products by simply raising the price on the good to reflect such liabilities. Some states, by statute, provide immunity for “innocent retailers” who were not the source of a product defect, requiring plaintiffs to generally sue the manufacturer except in instances where the manufacturer is insolvent, beyond the jurisdiction of the court, or where the retailers are not so innocent (e.g. having knowledge of the defect, or contributing in some way to causing the defect).</p>
<p id="661e08d2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Who Is a Seller?</i></b> Two interesting issues have arisen concerning who qualifies as a product “seller.” First, some plaintiffs have attempted to hold service providers strictly liable when their service involved the use of a product that contained a defect. For example, in Newmark v. Gimbel’s, Inc., 258 A.2d 697 (N.J. 1969), the plaintiff was hurt while receiving service at a beauty parlor by allegedly defective permanent wave solution. The salon owner resisted the strict liability claim, arguing that she was selling services rather than products. The New Jersey court permitted the strict liability claim. The court distinguished beauty parlors from other professional service providers. Two years earlier, in Magrine v. Krasnica, 227 A.2d 539 (N.J. 1967) the same court held that strict products liability could not be applied to a claim against a dentist who attempted to use a hypodermic needle to inject anesthetic into the plaintiff’s gums when it broke off <span title="753" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-753">p. 753</span>and caused injury to the patient. The court found that the dentist was providing professional services predominantly rather than selling products. It found that the rationales behind imposing strict liability on product sellers had no application to professionals. Other courts tend to agree that when the <i>primary purpose</i> behind the transaction is to bestow a professional service rather than sell a product, strict liability should be inapplicable. <i>See e.g.</i>, Easterly v. HSP of Texas, Inc., 772 S.W.2d 211, 213 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1989) (hospital could not be held strictly liable for defective catheter used at hospital on patient as it was an integral part of the professional services, not a separate product sale). Courts have also debated whether commercial lessors of products could be strictly liable as a product “seller” with most concluding that strict liability should be applicable. <i>See e.g.</i>, Cintrone v. Hertz Truck Leasing &amp; Rental Service, 212 A.2d 769 (N.J. 1965) (reversing dismissal of strict liability claim against Hertz which leased truck that was not in good working order).</p>
<p id="661e08d3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. <i>New vs. Used Goods</i>.</b> An individual who resells a used automobile or a used appliance at a garage sale will not face strict liability for a defect in those goods because they are not considered to be in the regular business of selling goods. Whether someone who engaged in the commercial re-sale of used products should face strict liability is a disputed matter. Compare Realmuto v. Straub Motors, 322 A.2d 440 (N.J. 1974) (strict liability applies to dealer who sells used products) with La Rosa v. Superior Court, 176 Cal. Rptr. 224 (1981) (refusing to apply strict liability to sellers of used goods).</p>
<p id="661e08d4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>6. <i>Warranty Law, Negligence Law, and Strict Liability</i>.</b> While one might read the foregoing cases and conclude that strict liability law has wholly displaced any continued role for warranty or negligence law when a consumer is hurt by a product, this would be misleading. While an injured party might not <i>need</i> to resort to the “intricacies of the law of sales” in order to seek recompense, that avenue can still be available. Both claims for breach of express and implied warranties are generally governed today by Article 2 of the U.C.C. On such claims, the U.C.C. does not stake out a certain position on the privity requirement, instead leaving three options to courts, with a range from (a) only the purchaser and immediate family and household guests being allowed to sue for breach of warranty to (b) all those foreseeably injured by the breach of warranty for the product being permitted to sue. Why would someone jump through the extra hoops necessary to bring a warranty claim? Sometimes the remedies might be broader (including the possibility of recovering for purely economic losses) or the breach might help to facilitate a broader attack against the seller under a state’s deceptive trade practices statute (which might permit recovery of attorney’s fees or trebled damages). Finally, it might be that under a state’s particular definitions of a product “defect” that a warranty claim might be subject to a different standard than a strict liability claim. (We will see this latter scenario later in this chapter in the <i>Denny v. Ford Motor Co.</i> case.) Also, negligence claims can likewise be brought in addition to a strict liability claim. It <span title="754" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-754">p. 754</span>may be that the plaintiff is able to conjure up evidence of traditional fault against a product seller and might want the jury to be able to receive this incriminating evidence. Further, the consumer might even be able to offer evidence of gross negligence to justify a submission on punitive damages to the jury. Thus, while the emergence of strict products liability law has freed consumers of the <i>necessity</i> of relying upon warranty and negligence causes of action, these alternative claims are still available in some circumstances.</p>
<p id="661e08d5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>7. <i>Defects that Are Unreasonably Dangerous</i>.</b> Comment g to Restatement (Second) 402A describes a “defective condition” as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="661e08d6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">The rule stated in this Section applies only where the product is, at the time it leaves the seller’s hands, in a condition not contemplated by the ultimate consumer, which will be unreasonably dangerous to him. The seller is not liable when he delivers the product in a safe condition, and subsequent mishandling or other causes make it harmful by the time it is consumed. The burden of proof that the product was in a defective condition at the time that it left the hands of the particular seller is upon the injured plaintiff; and unless the evidence can be produced which will support the conclusion that it was then defective, the burden is not sustained.</p></div>

<p id="661e08dc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Restatement (Second) §402A does not specify particular types of defects that may exist in a product. Nevertheless, courts have settled upon three categories of product defects—manufacturing, design, and marketing (i.e., warnings). A design defect occurs when the idea or plans for a product render it unreasonably dangerous. Imagine an automobile designer drawing up the plans for a new vehicle with wheels held in place by only two lug nuts. The plans might be followed perfectly but the wheel will likely fail because it is not designed to withstand enough physical forces on it to be able to hold it securely to the vehicle over time. This ill-conceived <i>design</i> for a wheel might permit the ultimate characterization that it was unreasonably dangerous and, therefore, defective. On the other hand, the design might have called for five lug nuts (a standard number for a passenger vehicle) but somewhere during the actual assembly of a particular unit on the assembly line, one car went through and only received four lug nuts. In other words, the plans were not followed. If that missing lug nut resulted in a wheel coming loose and causing an accident with <span title="755" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-755">p. 755</span>injuries, the claimant would assert a <i>manufacturing</i> defect. Finally, if you assume that even the best designed and properly manufactured automobile wheels might, over time, come loose due to the physics of their movement, it might be necessary for the seller to provide a warning accompanying the automobile warning that, for example, the tightness of the lug nuts needs to be checked every 25,000 miles to guarantee they remain tight. A failure to provide this warning could be evidence of a <i>marketing</i> defect.</p>
<p id="661e08dd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most would agree that identifying a manufacturing defect is, of the three categories, the most straightforward analysis. This does not always mean that it will be easy to determine; that is dependent upon how clear the facts may be. But courts generally agree as to what they are looking for when testing for a manufacturing defect. A manufacturing defect is described in the Restatement of Products Liability as a “physical departure from a product’s intended design.” Section 1, comment a (1998). In such cases, one is merely comparing the plans with the actual output of the unit that hurt the plaintiff. If the deviation from the plans caused the plaintiff’s injury, plaintiff has a good manufacturing defect case. Observe that the issue of how or why the defect occurs is irrelevant. Further, it makes no difference how hard the manufacturer tried to prevent such errors. Liability is very strict.</p>
<p id="661e2fee-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first case we will review, involving a claim by a smoker against a tobacco company, will apply this straightforward analysis by comparing the product that hurt the plaintiff with the plans for that product. This case actually involved manufacturing, design, and marketing defect claims. We will revisit this case again, therefore, in each of the next two sections as we encounter those types of defects. The second case, involving a chair that was apparently not strong enough to hold the plaintiff, concerns an attempted use of circumstantial evidence to prove the requisite departure from the plans in a case where the plaintiff’s expert could not identify any specific deviation.</p>

<p id="661e2ff5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1952, nineteen-year-old Wiley Grinnell began smoking Lucky Strikes, cigarettes manufactured by the American Tobacco Company. Almost a year later, Grinnell changed to Pall Malls, also manufactured by American. After smoking for approximately thirty-three years, Grinnell was diagnosed with lung cancer in July 1985. Shortly thereafter, he filed this lawsuit. He died less than a year later. Grinnell’s family continued this suit after his death, adding wrongful death and survival claims. The family alleges that American failed to warn of, and actively concealed, facts that it knew or should have known, <span title="756" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-756">p. 756</span>including the facts that Grinnell could quickly become addicted to cigarettes and that his smoking could result in injury or death from the cancer-causing ingredients if he used the cigarettes as American intended. They also allege that, even though American knew or should have known that its cigarettes were dangerous and could not be used safely, American represented to consumers that cigarettes were not harmful, dangerous, or capable of causing injury.</p>

<p id="661e2ff8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Grinnells allege that cigarettes are both defective and unreasonably dangerous under section 402A of the <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts</i>. Specifically, they assert that American’s cigarettes are (1) defectively designed because ingredients found in cigarettes cause cancer, addiction, and disease, (2) defectively marketed, because the cigarette packages contain inadequate warnings, and (3) defectively manufactured because cigarettes contain pesticide residue. In his deposition taken one month before his death, Grinnell testified that had he known of the dangers inherent in cigarettes he would never have started smoking in the first place.</p>

<p id="661e570f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We turn…to the Grinnells’ strict liability claim based on a manufacturing defect. The Grinnells assert that American’s products were defectively manufactured because they contained carcinogens and other toxic chemicals, <span title="757" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-757">p. 757</span>including pesticide residue. During discovery, the Grinnells obtained internal documents showing that American fumigated its Turkish tobacco with Acritet 34, a chemical composed of acrylonitrile and carbon tetrachloride. American uses Turkish tobacco in all of its cigarettes. In 1978, American circulated a memorandum noting new government regulations requiring all materials containing acrylonitrile to be affixed with a “Cancer Hazard” warning label. Likewise, the Grinnells allege that American knew that methyl bromide pesticide residue remained in its tobacco after fumigation. The Grinnells alleged that this potentially cancerous pesticide residue contributed to Grinnell’s cancer and resulting death.</p>
<p id="661e5710-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under Texas law, a plaintiff has a manufacturing defect claim when a finished product deviates, in terms of its construction or quality, from the specifications or planned output in a manner that renders it unreasonably dangerous. <i>SeeFord Motor Co. v. Pool</i>, 688 S.W.2d 879, 881 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 1985), <i>aff’d in part and rev’d in part on other grounds</i>, 715 S.W.2d 629 (Tex. 1986); <i>see also Lucas v. Texas Indus., Inc.</i>, 696 S.W.2d 372, 377-78 (Tex. 1984); <i>Morgan v. Compugraphic Corp.</i>, 675 S.W.2d 729, 732-33 (Tex. 1984); <i>Darryl v. Ford Motor Co.</i>, 440 S.W.2d 630, 632 (Tex. 1969). The common-knowledge defense does not apply to this type of claim because a user does not anticipate a manufacturing defect. This type of defect is a deviation from the planned output.</p>
<p id="661e5711-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">American, conceding that its cigarettes contain pesticide residue, argues that summary judgment was proper because all cigarette manufacturers fumigate their tobacco with some type of pesticide, and residue inevitably remains after fumigation. Thus, American concludes that the Grinnells’ claims based on the presence of pesticide residue are actually design defect claims masquerading as manufacturing defect claims.</p>
<p id="661e5712-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to the undisputed facts, pesticide residue is incidentally, yet normally, found in tobacco after it is fumigated. The presence of pesticide residue is not an anomaly attributable only to the cigarettes Grinnell smoked. Nevertheless, the fact that all cigarettes potentially contain pesticide residue does not transform the Grinnells’ manufacturing defect claim into a design defect claim subject to the common-knowledge defense. Simply because certain precautions or improvements in manufacturing technology, which could eliminate pesticide residue from cigarettes, are universally disregarded by an entire industry does not excuse their omission. <i>See T.J. Hooper</i>, 60 F.2d 737, 740 (2d Cir.), <i>cert. denied</i>, 287 U.S. 662 (1932). Although pesticide residue may be found in many if not all cigarettes, it is not an ingredient American intended to incorporate into its cigarettes. Analyzed in this light, the presence of pesticide residue could be a manufacturing defect, not a design defect. Therefore, American did not conclusively negate the existence of a defect in its cigarettes.</p>
<p id="661e5713-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We hold that summary judgment was improper on the manufacturing defect claim.</p>

<p id="661e5716-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Distinct Test for Manufacturing Defects.</i></b> The test for manufacturing defects assumes that the manufacturer had a good design, recipe, or plan for the product but something went awry in the details of actually making the particular product that hurt the plaintiff. This is normally demonstrated by comparing the original plans or specifications with the product that hurt the plaintiff to determine if there is any deviation. Alternatively, the plaintiff can compare the product causing her injuries with other ostensibly identical products made by the same manufacturer to determine if there were any flaws that led to the plaintiff’s injury. How did the plaintiffs in the tobacco case above demonstrate that something went awry in the manufacture of the cigarettes? Was the manufacturer really surprised by the cigarettes that it produced?</p>
<p id="661e5717-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Tainted Food Products</i>.</b> Sometimes manufacturers of some processed food will be sued when a contaminant is found inside their finished product that has injured someone. For example, in Jackson v. Nestle-Beich, Inc., 589 N.E.2d 547 (Ill. 1992), the plaintiff purchased a chocolate pecan-caramel candy made by the defendant. When the plaintiff bit into the candy, she broke her tooth due to the presence of a hard pecan shell within the piece of candy. Under the normal analysis for a manufacturing defect, one would easily conclude that unless the recipe calls for a shell in the finished product, the candy that hurt the plaintiff had a manufacturing defect. Nevertheless, the defendant attempted to invoke a doctrine recognized by a number of courts—the <i>foreign-natural doctrine</i>. Under this doctrine, manufacturing defects only exist when the unintended ingredient is wholly foreign to the items intended for the final prepared food item. For example, a hair from a rat found in a can of soup would be foreign to any of the intended ingredients. On the other hand, because the candy purchased by the plaintiff was supposed to have pecans, the shell from a pecan would be considered a natural (though unintended) ingredient and would not create a manufacturing defect. Many courts, including the Illinois Supreme Court in that case, reject this doctrine because it seems to inject issues of fault into what is supposed to be a strict liability analysis.</p>

<p id="661e7e32-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this strict products liability case involving one defendant, the primary issue is whether the doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> should be applied when liability is based upon an alleged manufacturing defect. The trial court declined to instruct the jury regarding <i>res ipsa loquitur.</i> The Appellate Division held that the trial court should have given such an instruction. We disagree and reverse. We hold that the traditional negligence doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> generally is not applicable in a strict products liability case. We adopt, however, the “indeterminate product defect test” established in Section 3 of the <i>Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability</i> as the more appropriate jury instruction in cases that do not involve a shifting of the burden of persuasion.</p>
<p id="661e7e33-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On July 6, 1991, plaintiff, John Myrlak, was injured when his chair collapsed while he was at work. At that time, plaintiff was forty-three years old, six feet six inches tall, and weighed approximately 325 pounds. Plaintiff was employed as an assistant trainmaster for the Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation (PATH). He worked at the Hoban Control Center at Journal Square in Jersey City. Plaintiff usually performed his duties while seated in a movable desk chair that was positioned at a semicircular console, approximately eight feet long and three feet high.</p>
<p id="661ea544-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the time of the accident, plaintiff had been seated in the chair performing his duties for approximately one hour and forty-five minutes. He suddenly heard a loud noise, and the back of his chair cracked and gave way. Plaintiff and the chair fell backwards, causing both to land parallel to the floor. Plaintiff grabbed the arms of the chair and pulled himself forward as he was falling. He injured his lower back and was hospitalized.</p>

<p id="661ea545-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although no one other than the plaintiff actually saw the accident, several PATH employees testified that they heard either a clicking or ratcheting sound, or a loud noise like a grinding of gears. After the accident, those employees observed that the back of the chair had collapsed and was parallel to the floor.</p>
<p id="661ea546-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The chair involved in the accident was manufactured by defendant Girsberger Industries, Inc. It was one of five hundred chairs purchased by PATH at the same time from the same company. All of the chairs were delivered to PATH either on November 1, 1990, or on May 1, 1991, and were placed in use at the Hoban Control Center on June 1, 1991. Thus, the chair that caused plaintiff’s accident had been in use for five weeks.</p>
<p id="661ea547-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The chair had a high backed seat with a triple joint construction that allowed the seat to follow the user’s movement by adjusting two levers. One of the levers positioned the chair in either a locked or a “free flow” mode; the other lever adjusted the height of the chair. The chair was also equipped with a tension control mechanism underneath the seat to adjust the tension of the chair’s back according to the user’s need or desire. Plaintiff was familiar with the chair and its operation.</p>
<p id="661ea548-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There was no evidence that the chair had been misused by plaintiff or any other PATH employee. The chair, however, was not used exclusively by plaintiff. On the contrary, it was customarily used by several different PATH employees twenty-four hours each day. Although some of the PATH employees who used the chair were similar in size to plaintiff, none of them ever reported any similar incidents or complaints with regard to the chair.</p>
<p id="661ea549-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff filed products liability claims against the manufacturer of the chair alleging a manufacturing theory of liability.</p>

<p id="661ea54b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the close of all of the evidence, plaintiff requested the court to charge the jury on <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> regarding the manufacturing defect claim. In denying the requested charge, the trial court stated that it wanted to avoid that phrase even though plaintiff relied on circumstantial evidence to infer that there was a manufacturing defect. The jury found that plaintiff failed to establish a manufacturing defect in the chair.</p>
<p id="661ea54c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a reported opinion, the Appellate Division reversed the verdict in favor of the manufacturer, concluding that the trial court should have instructed the jury on <i>res ipsa loquitur.</i> We granted defendant Girsberger’s petition for certification, limited to the issue whether <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> should apply to this strict products liability case.</p>
<p id="661ea54d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> doctrine derives its roots from the common law of England. The first reported decision to apply the doctrine in a case not involving railway collisions between two trains on the same line was <i>Byrne v. Boadle</i>, 159 Eng. Rep. 299, 300 (Exch. of Pleas 1863). The court permitted a presumption of negligence, reasoning that it was “apparent that the barrel was in the custody of the defendant who occupied the premises, and the fact of its falling is <i>prima <span title="761" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-761">p. 761</span>facie</i> evidence of negligence, but if there are any facts inconsistent with negligence it is for the defendant to prove them.”</p>
<p id="661ea54e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Res ipsa loquitur</i>, which in Latin means “the thing speaks for itself,” is a rule of law that has its origin in negligence and “governs the availability and adequacy of evidence of negligence in special circumstances.” <i>Brown v. Racquet Club of Bricktown</i>, 471 A.2d 25 (N.J. 1984). <i>Res ipsa loquitur</i> is not a theory of liability; rather, it is an evidentiary rule that governs the adequacy of evidence in some negligence cases. Specifically, the doctrine permits an inference of defendant’s want of due care when the following three conditions have been met: “(a) the occurrence itself ordinarily bespeaks negligence; (b) the instrumentality was within the defendant’s exclusive control; and (c) there is no indication in the circumstances that the injury was the result of the plaintiff’s own voluntary act or neglect.” <i>Bornstein v.

<p id="661ecc60-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the typical manufacturing defect case, a plaintiff is not required to establish negligence. In other words, a plaintiff must impugn the product but not the conduct of the manufacturer of the product.</p>
<p id="661ecc61-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Act defines a manufacturing defect as a deviation “from the design specifications, formulae, or performance standards of the manufacturer or from otherwise identical units manufactured to the same manufacturing specifications or formulae.” <i>N.J.S.A.</i> 2A:58C-2a. The Restatement defines a manufacturing defect as one in which “the product departs from its intended design though all possible care was exercised in the preparation and marketing of the product.” <i>Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability</i> §2(a). The Act’s and the Restatement’s definitions of a manufacturing defect both emphasize the safety of the product rather than the reasonableness of the manufacturer’s conduct.</p>
<p id="661ecc62-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Simply because a plaintiff is not required to prove fault in a strict liability case does not mean that absolute liability will be imposed upon a manufacturer. Although a plaintiff is relieved of proving fault, that plaintiff must nonetheless prove that the product was defective under our common law jurisprudence that was incorporated into the Act. Based on our well-established case law in this area, a plaintiff must prove that the product was defective, that the defect existed when the product left the manufacturer’s control, and that the defect proximately caused injuries to the plaintiff, a reasonably foreseeable or intended user.</p>
<p id="661ecc63-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As noted previously, a manufacturing defect under the Act occurs when the product comes off the production line in a substandard condition based on the manufacturer’s own standards or identical units that were made in accordance with the manufacturing specifications.</p>
<p id="661ecc64-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To prove both the existence of a defect and that the defect existed while the product was in the control of the manufacturer, a plaintiff may resort to direct evidence, such as the testimony of an expert who has examined the product, or, <span title="762" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-762">p. 762</span>in the absence of such evidence, to circumstantial proof. <i>Scanlon v. General Motors Corp.</i>, 326 A.2d 673 (N.J. 1974). The mere occurrence of an accident and the mere fact that someone was injured are not sufficient to demonstrate the existence of a defect.</p>
<p id="661ecc65-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the <i>Scanlon</i> circumstantial evidence method of proving a product defect, the fact that a product is relatively new does not suffice by itself to establish a defective condition. The age and prior usage of the product in relation to its expected life span are factors to consider in conjunction with other evidence presented. Generally, the older a product is, the more difficult it is to prove that a defect existed while in the manufacturer’s control.</p>
<p id="661ecc66-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Based on the foregoing legal principles synthesized from our products liability and <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> jurisprudence, it is evident that there are some technical differences between using <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> as a method of proving negligence and using that doctrine to prove a product defect in strict products liability cases. <i>Res ipsa loquitur</i> is a doctrine created under the fault theory of negligence as a means of circumstantially proving a defendant’s lack of due care. Strict products liability, on the other hand, is a theory of liability based upon allocating responsibility regardless of a defendant’s unreasonableness, negligence, or fault. Nonetheless, except in those rare cases in which the application of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> also involves a shifting of the burden of persuasion, there may be sound reasons to adopt a <i>res ipsa</i>-like method of circumstantially proving a product defect.</p>
<p id="661ecc67-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree with the majority of jurisdictions that, ordinarily, the traditional <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> jury charge should not be used in strict products liability actions. As noted previously, <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> is a negligence doctrine; it is a circumstantial means of proving a defendant’s lack of due care. Strict liability, on the other hand, is a theory of liability based on allocating responsibility regardless of a defendant’s unreasonableness, negligence or fault. Thus, while <i>res ipsa</i> might demonstrate a manufacturer’s negligence in failing to inspect or appropriately assemble a particular product, strict liability merely questions whether there is a defect in that product that existed before it left the manufacturer’s control.</p>
<p id="661ecc68-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We recognize that as an alternative to a traditional <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> instruction, various states and commentators have advocated an intermediate-type approach for circumstantially proving the existence of a product defect. That approach appears to best serve the interest of all parties and is not inconsistent with the Act.</p>

<p id="661ef37e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although Section 3 of the Restatement is based on a <i>res ipsa</i> model, it permits the jury to draw two inferences: that the harmful incident was caused by a product defect, and that the defect was present when the product left the manufacturer’s control. The <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> doctrine, on the other hand, creates the single inference of negligence. Nevertheless, Section 3 of the Restatement parallels the elements of our <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> doctrine.</p>
<p id="661ef37f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 3 of the Restatement has been referred to as the “indeterminate product test” because its use is limited to those product liability cases in which the plaintiff cannot prove a specific defect. A plaintiff can satisfy the requirements of Section 3 of the Restatement the same way as in the case of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>, by direct and circumstantial evidence as well as evidence that negates causes other than product defect.</p>
<p id="661ef380-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other jurisdictions have adopted similar circumstantial methods for establishing an inference of a product defect in strict products liability cases. We agree with those states that in some cases, “common experience indicates that certain accidents do not occur absent some defect,” and therefore an inference of a defect under specific circumstances should be permitted. Matthew R. Johnson, Note, <i>Rolling the “Barrel” a Little Further: Allowing Res Ipsa Loquitur to Assist in Proving Strict Liability in Tort Manufacturing Defects</i>, 38 Wm. &amp; Mary L. Rev. 1197, 1225 (1997). <i>See also Crump v. MacNaught P.T.Y. Ltd.</i>, 743 S.W.2d 532, 535 (Mo. Ct.

App. 1975) (implying that common sense would lead jury to conclude that television set was defective because it caught on fire). Fifteen other states have adopted the principles incorporated into Section 3 of the Restatement. We also adopt the indeterminate product defect test announced in Section 3 of the Restatement.</p>

Moreover, the circumstantial evidence charge that was given was equivalent to the indeterminate product test charge under Section 3 of the Restatement.</p>

<p id="661f1a97-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Res Ipsa and the Indeterminate Product Defect Theory.</i></b> The plaintiff in <i>Myrlak</i> desired a <i>res ipsa</i> instruction advising the jury of his right to rely upon circumstantial evidence to prove a manufacturing defect. On appeal, the court determined that a <i>res ipsa</i> instruction would be inappropriate because that was a negligence concept utilized to show fault through circumstantial evidence. Because the plaintiff was suing on a strict liability theory rather than negligence, such an instruction would be inappropriate. Nevertheless, citing the <i>indeterminate product defect test</i> from the Restatement (Third) of Torts §3, the court ultimately endorsed a jury instruction that likewise permitted the jury to rely upon circumstantial evidence to prove a manufacturing defect. Compare the prerequisites of each doctrine and the resulting inferences created. In reality, how different are these doctrines?</p>
<p id="661f1a98-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Circumstantial Evidence Appropriate Absent Direct Proof.</i></b> As we saw previously in the material on proving breach of the duty of reasonable care, the doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> is unavailable when direct proof of the defendant’s questioned conduct is available. Thus, the indeterminate product defect test only makes sense in application when comparison of the product to the manufacturer’s plans is not available. Additionally, because evidence of a manufacturer’s designs and warnings for its products is always available for scrutiny, this doctrine necessarily is limited to potential manufacturing defect theories.</p>
<p id="661f1a99-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Problem.</i></b> Imagine that plaintiff is a waitress at a restaurant transferring bottles of soft drinks from their original crates into a refrigerator. One of the bottles inexplicably explodes, causing severe injuries to her hand. Her employer throws away the pieces of the bottle while she is at the hospital. Can the plaintiff rely upon the indeterminate product defect theory to prove a manufacturing <span title="765" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-765">p. 765</span>defect? Because strict liability for manufacturing defects might involve invocation of similar rules of circumstantial evidence as a negligence suit, how different is strict liability today in such circumstances from 1944 in the <i>Escola</i> case?</p>

<p id="661f1a9c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">If one assumes a manufacturer’s ideas for a product are safe and appropriate, any unplanned deviations from that idea constitute a manufacturing or construction defect. If that deviation leads to physical harm to the plaintiff it would be considered an unreasonably dangerous manufacturing defect that makes sellers of that product strictly liable—regardless of any care undertaken to avoid that outcome. Even if the defendant has production protocols that eliminate 99.9 percent of all possible errors, the one flawed unit that falls through the cracks and injures the plaintiff still creates liability for the seller. It is the best example of truly strict liability as the focus is entirely upon the traits of the product and whether its production results in some surprising and undesired feature. In most cases, the analysis is very concrete, as one simply compares the original plans with the actual unit that hurt the plaintiff. Where such direct analysis is not possible—for example, where the unit is destroyed in the accident—resort to circumstantial evidence of a defect is permissible as well.</p>

<p id="661f1a9f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">In manufacturing defects, a particular unit in the defendant’s production has deviated from the original plans. By contrast, design defect claims involve accusations that the entire product line was ill conceived. Recall the example of the automobile manufacturer who designs a wheel held in place by only two lug nuts. After these wheels begin falling off of customers’ cars and causing injuries, an expert might opine that such design was destined to cause these accidents because of insufficient support for the weight of the wheels on the vehicle. The focus in design defect claims is not upon just the one automobile that plaintiff was driving, but upon the <i>entire line</i> of identically designed cars containing this same defect. Courts emphasize frequently that the design of the product is scrutinized rather than the designer, to contrast strict liability from negligence. Yet under the analysis of many courts, the line between negligence and strict liability can be easily obscured. As you will see in the following cases, some courts utilize a <i>consumer expectation test</i> to identify a design defect, while others resort to a balancing analysis referred to as the <i>risk utility test</i>. The difference in origin and operation of these two analytical models reflects the dual heritage (warranty and negligence law) of strict products liability.</p>

<p id="661f1aa2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Reflecting its warranty law heritage, the consumer expectation test for design defects focuses upon the expectations for the product’s performance by the ordinary consumer of the product. The origin of this particular test comes from comments contained within the Restatement (Second) of Torts §402A: “The rule stated in this Section applies only where the defective condition of the product makes it unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer. The article sold must be dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it, with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to its characteristic.” In the <i>Sparks</i> case below, the California appellate court discusses when this test is appropriately used in a design defect case and what evidence is appropriately used to analyze its application. Pay close attention to the evidence utilized by the plaintiffs to substantiate their claims of a design defect and also observe the evidence defendant unsuccessfully argued should instead be the focal point.</p>

(Owens-Illinois or appellant), timely appeals from a judgment entered after a jury trial, by which it was held 100 percent responsible for personal injuries to Charles Wayne Sparks (Sparks) and his wife, Betty Raley Sparks, respondents herein. The jury found that an Owens-Illinois product, an asbestos-containing thermal insulation known as Kaylo, was defective, and that the defect was the sole legal cause of injury to Sparks. Appellant contends that…[t]here was no evidence that Kaylo was defective because plaintiffs failed to show that it could have been designed more safely, i.e., without asbestos as a component.</p>
<p id="661f41ba-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Owens-Illinois made and sold a product known as “Kaylo” between 1948 and 1958. Kaylo was a calcium silicate insulation, made with 13 to 20 percent asbestos, which was sold in pipe-covering and block forms, and intended to be used for “industrial high[-]temperature thermal insulation.” The asbestos used in Kaylo was predominantly of the chrysotile variety but amosite was also used to a lesser extent. Owens-Illinois sold its Kaylo operation to Owens-Corning Fiberglass in April 1958. Owens-Corning Fiberglass continued to make and sell Kaylo pipe covering and block insulation after April 1958.</p>
<p id="661f41bb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Charles Sparks joined the United States Navy in 1959, when he was 20 years old. Although he originally intended to obtain training as a draftsman, he was instead sent for training as a metalsmith. Also in 1959, Sparks met and married his wife, Betty. Shortly after he was married, Sparks was sent out on a six-month cruise aboard the heavy cruiser U.S.S. Bremerton.</p>

<p id="661f41bc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Bremerton operated on steam turbines and, therefore, had many pipes, valves, condensers, heat exchangers, generators, boilers, and other machinery which had to be insulated against high temperatures. There was no significant work on the insulation during the cruise but, in January or February of 1960, the Bremerton was sent to Long Beach for a decommissioning overhaul, which lasted approximately six months. Sparks’s duty aboard the Bremerton during the decommissioning was to remove and inspect the valves in the various pipelines. In order for Sparks to do this, the insulation had to be sawed or cut, and removed from the pipes. A great deal of dust was generated by the procedures Sparks followed to remove the insulation and the valves. At the same time, the boilers and other machinery were being overhauled by procedures that also generated dust to which Sparks was exposed. Regular cleanup procedures during the decommissioning involved the use of compressed air and fox-tail brooms, both of which generated a large amount of dust.</p>
<p id="661f41bd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs presented the deposition testimony of another insulator who worked at the Puget Sound Shipyard. That witness, Ralph David, testified that he had no idea that his workplace exposure to asbestos could be dangerous to his health. Mr. David further stated that both he and the other workers who ripped out and installed asbestos-containing insulation simply assumed that it was part of their job and that there was no particular danger in it.</p>

That the defect in design existed when the product left the defendant’s possession; 3. That the design of the product was a legal cause of Mr. Sparks[’s] injury; 4. That the product was used in a manner reasonably foreseeable by the defendant; [and 5.] the nature and extent of Charles Sparks[’s] and Betty Spark[s’s] injuries.”</p>
<p id="661f68d8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Owens-Illinois contends that the jury verdict must be reversed because there was no showing that Kaylo was a defective product. That is, Owens-Illinois contends plaintiffs were required to show that high-temperature insulation such as Kaylo could have been more safely designed, i.e., without asbestos, for use aboard Navy ships. Respondent argues that it was not required to make such a showing in this case, in which the jury was properly instructed to apply only the “consumer expectation” test to determine whether appellant’s product was defectively designed. Respondent has the better of this argument.</p>
<p id="661f68d9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is well settled in California that a manufacturer may be held strictly liable in tort for placing a defective product on the market if that product causes personal injury, provided that the injury resulted from a use of the product that was reasonably foreseeable by the defendant. This doctrine of strict liability extends to products which have design defects, manufacturing defects, or “warning defects.”</p>
<p id="661f68da-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The instant case involves only allegations of design defects. It is, thus, governed by <i>Barker</i> [<i>v. Lull Engineering Co.</i>, 573 P.2d 443 (Cal. 1978)], where our Supreme Court held that a product may be found defective in design under either of two alternative theories. “First, a product may be found defective in design if the plaintiff <span title="769" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-769">p. 769</span>establishes that the product failed to perform as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect when used in an intended or reasonably foreseeable manner. Under this first, so-called “consumer expectation test,” a plaintiff is required to produce evidence of the “objective conditions of the product” as to which the jury is to employ its “own sense of whether the product meets ordinary expectations as to its safety under the circumstances presented by the evidence.”</p>
<p id="661f68db-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second prong of the <i>Barker</i> test for design defects is as follows: “[A] product may alternatively be found defective in design if the plaintiff demonstrates that the product’s design proximately caused his injury and the defendant fails to establish, in light of the relevant factors, that, on balance, the benefits of the challenged design outweigh the risk of danger inherent in such design.” In order to satisfy its burden under this so-called “risk-benefit” theory, the defendant manufacturer may—but is not required to—present evidence of the feasibility of a safer alternative design, the financial cost of an improved design, and any adverse consequences to the product or the consumer from the alternative design.</p>
<p id="661f68dc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiffs in this case limited their theory of recovery by electing to proceed only under the “consumer expectation test” for design defects. Owens-Illinois contends, however, that it was error to allow the plaintiffs to proceed in this fashion because the “consumer expectation test” is inappropriate in this case in that the undisputed evidence establishes that Kaylo was “the best possible product that could have been manufactured.” Owens-Illinois further contends that plaintiffs were required—and failed—to prove that there was a safer alternative design for Kaylo. We reject these arguments, which are devoid of factual and legal support.</p>
<p id="661f68dd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our Supreme Court recently analyzed the circumstances under which the “consumer expectation test” should, and should not, be employed. <i>Soule v</i>. <i>General Motors Corp</i>., 882 P.2d 298 (Cal. 1994). The court held that “the consumer expectations test is reserved for cases in which the <i>everyday experience</i> of the product’s users permits a conclusion that the product’s design violated <i>minimum</i> safety assumptions, and is thus defective <i>regardless of expert opinion about the merits of the design</i>.” The <i>Soule</i> court further held that where the consumer expectation test applies, evidence of the relative risks and benefits of the design is irrelevant and inadmissible: “If the facts permit such a conclusion, and if the failure resulted from the product’s design, a finding of defect is warranted without any further proof. The manufacturer <i>may not defend</i> a claim that a product’s design failed to perform as safely as its ordinary consumers would expect by presenting expert evidence of the design’s relative risks and benefits.”</p>
<p id="661f8fee-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, our Supreme Court held that the “consumer expectation test” should <i>not</i> be used where the alleged injury resulted from products whose characteristics or performance are beyond the understanding or common experience of those who ordinarily use them.…Such “instances” include claims involving “complex” products which “cause injury in a way that does not engage its ordinary consumers’ reasonable minimum assumptions about safe performance.”</p>
<p id="661f8fef-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Soule</i> case provides a good example of a situation in which the consumer expectation test is not appropriate. There, the court was confronted with a complicated claim that General Motors’ defective design of the wheel assembly and front floorboard enhanced the injuries the plaintiff suffered when another car collided with the left front wheel area of her automobile. As the court explained, “Plaintiff’s theory of design defect was one of technical and mechanical detail. It sought to examine the precise behavior of several obscure components of her car under the complex circumstances of a particular accident. The collision’s exact speed, angle, and point of impact were disputed. It seems settled, however, that <span title="770" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-770">p. 770</span>plaintiff’s Camaro received a substantial oblique blow near the left front wheel, and that the adjacent frame members and bracket assembly absorbed considerable inertial force.” The court held that the consumer expectation test should not have been used: “An ordinary consumer of automobiles cannot reasonably expect that a car’s frame, suspension, or interior will be designed to remain intact in any and all accidents. Nor would ordinary experience and understanding inform such a consumer how safely an automobile’s design should perform under the esoteric circumstances of the collision at issue here. Indeed, both parties assumed that quite complicated design considerations were at issue, and that expert testimony was necessary to illuminate these matters.”</p>
<p id="661f8ff0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There were neither “complicated design considerations,” nor “obscure components,” nor “esoteric circumstances” surrounding the “accident” in the instant case. Kaylo was a common type of asbestos-containing block insulation. It was a simple, stationary product in its ordinary uses. Because it was made of friable material that had to be cut and shaped to perform its insulating function on irregularly shaped objects, it generated large amounts of asbestos-laden dust during normal installation, inspection, removal, and replacement processes. The design failure was in Kaylo’s emission of highly toxic, respirable fibers in the normal course of its intended use and maintenance as a high-temperature thermal insulation. It is a reasonable inference from the evidence that this emission of respirable fibers, which were capable of causing a fatal lung disease after a long latency period, was a product failure beyond the “legitimate, commonly accepted minimum safety assumptions of its ordinary consumers.”</p>
<p id="661f8ff1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The instant case is analogous to <i>West v</i>. <i>Johnson &amp; Johnson Products, Inc</i>. (1985) 174 Cal. App. 3d 831. In <i>West</i>, the plaintiff became seriously ill during her menstrual period. At the time, there were growing indications that tampon use sometimes caused toxic shock syndrome (TSS). After reading medical reports, plaintiff’s physicians belatedly concluded that she had suffered TSS caused by tampons produced by the defendant. At trial, experts debated the nature of plaintiff’s illness, and disputed whether the tampon design and materials used by the defendant encouraged TSS. The trial court instructed the jury only on the “consumer expectation test” prong of <i>Barker</i>, and the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.</p>
<p id="661f8ff2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On appeal, the defendant contended that the risk-benefit test alone was proper. The Court of Appeal…reasoned that, in a time before there was general awareness and warnings about TSS, the plaintiff “had every right to expect” that use of such a seemingly innocuous product “would not lead to a serious (or perhaps fatal) illness.”</p>
<p id="661f8ff3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The same is true here. Plaintiffs presented ample evidence that, when used in the intended manner, Kaylo violated the minimum safety expectations of its ordinary consumers. For example, Ralph David testified that he and other insulators freely manipulated asbestos-containing insulation products such as Kaylo during both installation and removal procedures, all the while assuming that it was innocuous, just part of their job. Samuel Schillaci, the Owens-Illinois employee who was responsible for the Kaylo division in the 1950’s, testified <span title="771" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-771">p. 771</span>that he frequently observed workers in the field sawing Kaylo, generating dust, but not wearing respirators. Plaintiff himself testified that he and all the other workers around him on the Bremerton worked with asbestos-containing insulation and cleaned up after such projects in a manner that caused large amounts of dust to circulate throughout the work area, without any special precautions against the generation, distribution or inhalation of the asbestos fibers, and without any expectation that the respirable fibers could cause serious illness. The jury could infer from this and other testimony that the ordinary users of Kaylo in the late 1950’s and early 1960’s did not expect to develop a fatal disease from simply breathing Kaylo dust and, thus, that the product’s performance did not meet the “minimum safety assumptions of its ordinary consumers.” We conclude that the trial court did not err by instructing the jury only on the “consumer expectation test,” and that there was substantial evidence to support the jury finding of a design defect in Kaylo.</p>
<p id="661f8ff4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For all the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed in its entirety.</p>

<p id="661f8ff7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Relevant Evidence Under Consumer Expectation Test.</i></b> As the court clarifies in <i>Sparks</i>, when the consumer expectation test is utilized, the plaintiff offers evidence of the circumstances surrounding the product and its usage. The jury then resorts to its “own sense” of whether the product meets the expectations of ordinary consumers. What evidence did the plaintiff in <i>Sparks</i> offer the jury that the court concluded enabled the jury to find a design defect? By contrast, the court held that expert testimony regarding the risks and benefits of the design chosen and the availability of other possible designs would be irrelevant under this analysis. Given the nature of the evidentiary inquiry, do you understand the appeal of this test for a design defect to a plaintiff’s lawyer? Consider the cost and ease of offering the evidence of a design defect given the limited nature of the inquiry and the evidence ruled irrelevant.</p>

<p id="661fb60a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Motions <i>in limine</i> literally refer to being “at the threshold” of a proceeding. These are evidentiary motions made before the jury is seated to resolve known evidentiary disputes prior to a jury hearing any evidence or arguments that might be highly prejudicial or inappropriate. Sometimes such motions raised fundamental legal questions for the court.</p>
</div>
<p id="661fb60b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>State of the Art Evidence.</i></b> The trial court had granted the plaintiff’s pretrial <i>motion in limine</i> ruling that the defendant’s proffered “state-of-the-art defense” evidence was inappropriate under the consumer expectation test. In design defect cases analyzed under the alternative risk utility test, as we shall see, courts focus upon a cost-benefit analysis of the details of the defendant’s chosen design, taking into account the <span title="772" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-772">p. 772</span>state of the art of knowledge available. In such cases, defendants sometimes defend these claims on the grounds that, at the time of the product’s design, the state of the art did not include knowledge of the risks of using the product. Some states even have statutes that provide a “state of the art defense” in instances when the defendant can show that it used a design that was, at the time, as technologically advanced as was reasonably possible. One fundamental difference between the consumer expectation test and the risk utility test is that the former focuses exclusively upon the awareness of risks by the <i>consumers</i> of the product; knowledge on the part of the manufacturer is irrelevant.</p>
<p id="661fb60c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Consumer Expectation as Preferred Test.</i></b> Some jurisdictions prefer the consumer expectation test as its primary design defect analysis, and many reject it. Other jurisdictions, such as California, offer more of a hybrid system that requires the consumer expectation test to be utilized in cases involving non-complex goods but mandates the risk utility test where the product is so esoteric or complex that ordinary consumers would have no particular expectations regarding its safety under the circumstances of the case. Why does the <i>Sparks</i> court believe that the consumer expectation test is more appropriate in claims involving asbestos-infused insulation and tampons but not appropriate in the case involving the design of a car’s floorboard? Also, note that under the consumer expectation test the controlling standard is <i>not</i> the subjective beliefs of the injured claimant but the objective viewpoint of the ordinary users of the product.</p>

<p id="661fdd26-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This appeal from a jury verdict and entry of judgment in favor of the plaintiffs arises out of a New Jersey automobile accident in which a police officer was seriously injured. The legal questions in this diversity action, that are governed <span title="773" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-773">p. 773</span>by New Jersey law, are relatively straight-forward. The public policy questions, however, which are beyond the competence of this Court to resolve and with which Congress ultimately must grapple, are complex and implicate national economic and social concerns.</p>
<p id="661fdd27-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In adjudicating this appeal, we first decide the question whether the district court erred in denying the defendant’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. [We will also] address the troubling public policy dilemma namely, that under existing federal law individual juries in the various states are permitted, in effect, to establish national automobile safety standards. The result of such an arrangement, predictably, is not only incoherence in the safety requirements set by disparate juries, but also the possibility that a standard established by a jury in a particular case will conflict with other policies regarding the economics of the automobile industry as well as energy conservation programs.</p>
<p id="661fdd28-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On September 7, 1974, Richard F. Dawson, while in the employ of the Pennsauken Police Department, was seriously injured as a result of an automobile accident that occurred in Pennsauken, New Jersey. As Dawson was driving on a rain-soaked highway, responding to a burglar alarm, he lost control of his patrol car a 1974 Dodge Monaco. The car slid off the highway, over a curb, through a small sign, and into an unyielding steel pole that was fifteen inches in diameter. The car struck the pole in a backwards direction at a forty-five degree angle on the left side of the vehicle; the point of impact was the left rear wheel well. As a result of the force of the collision, the vehicle literally wrapped itself around the pole. The pole ripped through the body of the car and crushed Dawson between the seat and the “header” area of the roof, located just above the windshield. The so-called “secondary collision” of Dawson with the interior of the automobile dislocated Dawson’s left hip and ruptured his fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae. As a result of the injuries, Dawson is now a quadriplegic. He has no control over his body from the neck down, and requires constant medical attention.</p>
<p id="661fdd29-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dawson, his wife, and their son brought suit in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia against the Chrysler Corporation, the manufacturer of the vehicle in which Dawson was injured. Chrysler removed the case to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on the grounds of diversity, and subsequently had the case transferred to the District Court for the District of New Jersey. The plaintiffs’ [strict products liability theory was] that the patrol car was defective because it did not have a full, continuous steel frame extending through the door panels, and a cross-member running through the floor board between the posts located between the front and rear doors of the vehicle. Had the vehicle been so designed, the Dawsons alleged, it would have “bounced” off the pole following relatively slight penetration by the pole into the passenger space.</p>
<p id="661fdd2a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Expert testimony was introduced by the Dawsons to prove that the existing frame of the patrol car was unable to withstand side impacts at relatively low speed, and that the inadequacy of the frame permitted the pole to enter the passenger area and to injure Dawson. The same experts testified that the improvements in the design of the frame that the plaintiffs proposed were <span title="774" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-774">p. 774</span>feasible and would have prevented Dawson from being injured as he was. According to plaintiffs’ expert witnesses, a continuous frame and cross-member would have deflected the patrol car away from the pole after a minimal intrusion into the passenger area and, they declared, Dawson likely would have emerged from the accident with only a slight injury.</p>
<p id="661fdd2b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In response, Chrysler argued that it had no duty to produce a “crashproof” vehicle, and that, in any event, the patrol car was not defective. Expert testimony for Chrysler established that the design and construction of the 1974 Dodge Monaco complied with all federal vehicle safety standards, and that deformation of the body of the vehicle is desirable in most crashes because it absorbs the impact of the crash and decreases the rate of deceleration on the occupants of the vehicle. Thus, Chrysler’s experts asserted that, for most types of automobile accidents, the design offered by the Dawsons would be less safe than the existing design. They also estimated that the steel parts that would be required in the model suggested by the Dawsons would have added between 200 and 250 pounds to the weight, and approximately $300 to the price of the vehicle. It was also established that the 1974 Dodge Monaco’s unibody construction was stronger than comparable Ford and Chevrolet vehicles.</p>
<p id="661fdd2c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After all testimony had been introduced, Chrysler moved for a directed verdict, which the district judge denied. The jury thereupon returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs. The jury awarded Mr. Dawson $2,064,863.19 for his expenses, disability, and pain and suffering, and granted Mrs. Dawson $60,000.00 for loss of consortium and loss of services. After the district court entered judgment, Chrysler moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, alternatively for a new trial. The court denied both motions.</p>
<p id="661fdd2d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the outset, it is important, indeed crucial, to point out, that the substantive issues of this diversity case are controlled by the law of New Jersey. [W]e proceed with the adjudication of this appeal pursuant to the rubric of strict liability.</p>
<p id="661fdd2e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chrysler urges that…it had no obligation to manufacture a vehicle that would protect a passenger against the type of harm suffered by Dawson. As we understand Chrysler’s argument, however, it appears to be directed, not to Chrysler’s duty vis-a-vis Dawson, but rather to the question whether the patrol car was defective inasmuch as it did not adequately prevent Dawson from sustaining serious injury. For, as we stated in <i>Huddell</i>, it is “beyond peradventure that an automobile manufacturer today has some legal obligation to design and produce a reasonably crashworthy vehicle. Rephrased in the terminology of strict liability, the manufacturer must consider accidents as among the “intended uses of its products,” and passengers injured in such accidents as among the group of reasonably foreseeable plaintiffs.</p>
<p id="661fdd2f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, the controlling issue in the case is whether the jury could be permitted to find, under the law of New Jersey, that the patrol car was defective.</p>
<p id="661fdd30-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The determination whether a product [contains a design defect] is to be informed by what the New Jersey Supreme Court has termed a “risk/utility analysis.” <i>Cepeda v. Cumberland Engineering Co., Inc.</i>, 386 A.2d 816, 825-29 <span title="775" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-775">p. 775</span>(N.J. 1978). Under this approach, a product is defective if “a reasonable person would conclude that the magnitude of the scientifically perceivable danger as it is proved to be at the time of trial outweighed the benefits of the way the product was so designed and marketed.” <i>Id</i>. at 826. The court in <i>Cepeda</i> identified seven factors that might be relevant to this balancing process:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="661fdd31-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(1) The usefulness and desirability of the product its utility to the user and to the public as a whole.</p>

<p id="66200448-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court suggested that the trial judge first determine whether a balancing of these factors precludes liability as a matter of law. If it does not, then the judge is to incorporate into the instructions any factor for which there was presented specific proof and which might be deemed relevant to the jury’s consideration of the matter.</p>
<p id="66200449-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chrysler maintains that, under these standards, the district court erred in submitting the case to the jury because the Dawsons failed, as a matter of law, to prove that the patrol car was defective. Specifically, it insists that the Dawsons did not present sufficient evidence from which the jury reasonably might infer that the alternative design that they proffered would be safer than the existing design, or that it would be cost effective, practical, or marketable. In short, Chrysler urges that the substitute design would be less socially beneficial than was the actual design of the patrol car. In support of its argument, Chrysler emphasizes that the design of the 1974 Dodge Monaco complied with all of the standards authorized by Congress in the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, Pub. L. 89-563, tit. I, §107, 80 Stat. 718, codified in 15 U.S.C. §1396 (1976), and set forth in accompanying regulations, 49 C.F.R. §571.1 (1979).</p>
<p id="6620044a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Compliance with the safety standards promulgated pursuant to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, however, does not relieve Chrysler of liability in this action. For, in authorizing the Secretary of Transportation to enact these standards, Congress explicitly provided, “Compliance with any Federal motor vehicle safety standard issued under this subchapter does not exempt any person from any liability under common law.” 15 U.S.C. §1397(c) (1976). <span title="776" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-776">p. 776</span>Thus, consonant with this congressional directive, we must review Chrysler’s appeal on the question of the existence of a defect under the common law of New Jersey that is set forth above.</p>
<p id="6620044b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our examination of the record persuades us that the district court did not err in denying Chrysler’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The Dawsons demonstrated that the frame of the 1974 Dodge Monaco was noncontinuous that is, it consisted of a front portion that extended from the front of the car to the middle of the front passenger seat, and a rear portion that ran from the middle of the rear passenger seat to the back end of the vehicle. Thus, there was a gap in the seventeen-inch side area of the frame between the front and rear seats. The plaintiffs also proved that, after colliding with the pole, the car slid along the left side portion of the rear frame until it reached the gap in the frame. At that point, the pole tore through the body of the vehicle into the passenger area and proceeded to push Dawson into the header area above the windshield.</p>
<p id="6620044c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Three experts, a design analyst, a mechanical engineer, and a biochemical engineer also testified on behalf of the Dawsons. These witnesses had examined the patrol car and concluded that it was inadequate to withstand side impacts. They testified that there was an alternative design available which, had it been employed in the 1974 Monaco, would have prevented Dawson from sustaining serious injuries. The substitute design called for a continuous frame with an additional cross member running between the so-called B-posts the vertical posts located at the side of the car between the front and rear seats. According to these witnesses, this design was known in the industry well before the accident and had been tested by a number of independent testing centers in 1969 and in 1973.</p>
<p id="6620044d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The mechanical engineer conducted a number of studies in order to ascertain the extent to which the alternative design would have withstood the crash. On the basis of these calculations, he testified that the pole would have penetrated only 9.9 inches into the passenger space, and thus would not have crushed Dawson. Instead, the engineer stated, the car would have deflected off the pole and back into the highway. Under these circumstances, according to the biochemical engineer, Dawson would have been able to “walk away from the accident” with but a bruised shoulder.</p>
<p id="6620044e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Also introduced by the Dawsons were reports of tests conducted for the United States Department of Transportation, which indicated that, in side collisions with a fixed pole at twenty-one miles per hour, frame improvements similar to those proposed by the experts presented by the Dawsons reduced intrusion into the passenger area by fifty percent, from sixteen inches to eight inches. The study concluded that the improvements, “in conjunction with interior alterations, demonstrated a dramatic increase in occupant protection.” There was no suggestion at trial that the alternative design recommended by the Dawsons would not comply with federal safety standards. On cross-examination, Chrysler’s attorney did get the Dawsons’ expert witnesses to acknowledge that the alternative design would add between 200 and 250 pounds to the <span title="777" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-777">p. 777</span>vehicle and would cost an additional $300 per car. The Dawsons’ experts also conceded that the heavier and more rigid an automobile, the less able it is to absorb energy upon impact with a fixed object, and therefore the major force of an accident might be transmitted to the passengers. Moreover, an expert for Chrysler testified that, even if the frame of the patrol car had been designed in conformity with the plaintiffs’ proposals, Dawson would have sustained injuries equivalent to those he actually incurred. Chrysler’s witness reasoned that Dawson was injured, not by the intrusion of the pole into the passenger space, but as a result of being thrown into the header area of the roof by the vehicle’s initial contact with the pole that is, prior to the impact of the pole against the driver’s seat.</p>
<p id="6620044f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the basis of the foregoing recitation of the evidence presented respectively by the Dawsons and by Chrysler, we conclude that the record is sufficient to sustain the jury’s determination…that the design of the 1974 Monaco was defective. The jury was not required to ascertain that all of the factors enumerated by the New Jersey Supreme Court in <i>Cepeda</i> weighed in favor of the Dawsons in order to find the patrol car defective. Rather, it need only to have reasonably concluded, after balancing these factors, that, at the time Chrysler distributed the 1974 Monaco, the car was “not reasonably fit, suitable and safe for its intended or reasonably foreseeable purposes.” <i>Suter</i>, 406 A.2d at 149.</p>
<p id="66200450-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although we affirm the judgment of the district court, we do so with uneasiness regarding the consequences of our decision and of the decisions of other courts throughout the country in cases of this kind.</p>
<p id="66202b61-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As we observed earlier, Congress, in enacting the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, provided that compliance with the Act does not exempt any person from liability under the common law of the state of injury. The effect of this provision is that the states are free, not only to create various standards of liability for automobile manufacturers with respect to design and structure, but also to delegate to the triers of fact in civil cases arising out of automobile accidents the power to determine whether a particular product conforms to such standards. In the present situation, for example, the New Jersey Supreme Court has instituted a strict liability standard for cases involving defective products, has defined the term “defective product” to mean any such item that is not “reasonably fit, suitable and safe for its intended or reasonably foreseeable purposes,” and has left to the jury the task of determining whether the product at issue measures up to this standard.</p>
<p id="66202b62-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The result of such arrangement is that while the jury found Chrysler liable for not producing a rigid enough vehicular frame, a factfinder in another case might well hold the manufacturer liable for producing a frame that is too rigid. Yet, as pointed out at trial, in certain types of accidents head-on collisions it is desirable to have a car designed to collapse upon impact because the deformation would absorb much of the shock of the collision, and divert the force of deceleration away from the vehicle’s passengers. In effect, this permits individual juries applying varying laws in different jurisdictions to set nationwide automobile safety standards and to impose on automobile manufacturers conflicting requirements. It <span title="778" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-778">p. 778</span>would be difficult for members of the industry to alter their design and production behavior in response to jury verdicts in such cases, because their response might well be at variance with what some other jury decides is a defective design. Under these circumstances, the law imposes on the industry the responsibility of insuring vast numbers of persons involved in automobile accidents.</p>
<p id="66202b63-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Equally serious is the impact on other national social and economic goals of the existing case-by-case system of establishing automobile safety requirements. As we have become more dependent on foreign sources of energy, and as the price of that energy has increased, the attention of the federal government has been drawn to a search to find alternative supplies and the means of conserving energy. More recently, the domestic automobile industry has been struggling to compete with foreign manufacturers which have stressed smaller, more fuel-efficient cars. Yet, during this same period, Congress has permitted a system of regulation by ad hoc adjudications under which a jury can hold an automobile manufacturer culpable for not producing a car that is considerably heavier, and likely to have less fuel efficiency.</p>
<p id="66202b64-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, this appeal has brought to our attention an important conflict that implicates broad national concerns. Although it is important that society devise a proper system for compensating those injured in automobile collisions, it is not at all clear that the present arrangement of permitting individual juries, under varying standards of liability, to impose this obligation on manufacturers is fair or efficient. Inasmuch as it was the Congress that designed this system, and because Congress is the body best suited to evaluate and, if appropriate, to change that system, we decline today to do anything in this regard except to bring the problem to the attention of the legislative branch.</p>
<p id="66202b65-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Bound as we are to adjudicate this appeal according to the substantive law of New Jersey, and because we find no basis in that law to overturn the jury’s verdict, the judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>

<div class="epub-heading cc-font-xlarge left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="66202b67-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b">NOTES AND PROBLEMS</p></h3></div>
<p id="66202b68-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Similarities to Negligence</i>.</b> The comparison of the product’s utility with the risks associated with the product’s intended or foreseeable uses, appears strangely familiar to the Learned Hand analysis for breach of duty in a negligence case (see Chapter 4). You might say that a reasonable automobile designer would necessarily take into account the same factors that courts utilize in applying the risk utility analysis. This has led to the observation by some that strict liability design defect claims are functionally the equivalent of a negligence claim.</p>
<p id="66202b69-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Differences from Negligence</i>.</b> Despite similarities between negligence analysis and the risk utility test, many theoretical and some practical differences demonstrate that they are not identical. For example, the “state of the art” of an <span title="779" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-779">p. 779</span>industry’s knowledge can be utilized in determining the risk portion of the risk utility test, even if there is no proof that a reasonable manufacturer did or should have known of the risk. Furthermore, some courts explicitly (and others implicitly) permit hindsight to be considered in applying the risk utility test; whereas this application of hindsight would be abhorrent to a court evaluating a negligence claim. In addition, the jury considers the qualitative aspects of the product in a strict liability claim rather than the conduct of the defendant seller—evidence of what the defendant knew is theoretically not germane in a strict liability case. Finally, when the risk utility test is applied in the case of a non-manufacturing commercial seller of a product (for which liability is just as broad under Restatement (Second) of Torts §402A), the fact that the seller was not involved with the design of the product is no defense.</p>
<p id="66202b6a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Crashworthiness as a Design Defect</i>.</b> Many auto manufacturers have argued that a car need not be designed to perform in any particular way during a crash because the car’s intended purpose is not to be involved in an accident. They argue that being in a crash constitutes a type of product “misuse” that need not be taken into account in designing the product. Most (though not all) courts have rejected this argument because of the inevitability of car accidents. These courts have held that such use is a foreseeable, even if not desired, use of the product and that this foreseeability compels consideration of the risks involved in designing the car. <i>See e.g.</i>, Larsen v. General Motors Corp., 391 F.2d 495, 502 (8th Cir. 1968). In applying this crashworthy doctrine, most courts put the burden on the defendant, once a defect is proven, to differentiate between the underlying damages from the accident itself and the enhancement of the injuries from the car not being safe in the event of a crash. If the defendant cannot provide a basis for the jury separating out the initial harm from the secondary injury, the defendant is liable for all of the harm incurred in the accident.</p>
<p id="66202b6b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Federal Issue: Preemption of State Law Claims</i>.</b> The court above refused the defense offered by the defendant that its compliance with federal regulations in designing the product offered a safe harbor of immunity. There are instances where courts have found that congressional legislation evidences either an express or implied <i>preemption</i> of any state law to the contrary. If the court believes that Congress did not intend to tolerate any standard for the defendant’s conduct different than a federal standard, preemption would sometimes preclude a state law tort claim where the defendant’s design (or warning) for a product finds federal approval. Because the federal statute in the above case expressly stated otherwise, there was no federal preemption of the claims. In an important and relatively recent opinion, the U.S. Supreme Court held in Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.S. 555 (2009), that the FDA’s approval of certain drug labels did not preempt any state law strict liability claim asserting a marketing (warning) defect. In its opinion written by Justice Stevens, the court said that there is a strong presumption against preemption, which could only be <span title="780" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-780">p. 780</span>rebutted by a “clear and manifest purpose” in the legislation to supersede the historic police powers of the state.</p>
<p id="66202b6c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. <i>State Law Issue: Weight to Be Given Compliance</i>.</b> Even where there is no federal preemption (a question of federal law), it is up to each state to determine what weight, if any, to give to the fact that the federal government has approved a design or warning for a particular product. While some courts expressly hold that such a circumstance is irrelevant to the state law inquiry into a possible product defect (<i>see</i> Edwards v. Basel Pharmaceuticals, 933 P.2d 298 (Okla. 1997)), other states have ruled otherwise, often by virtue of tort reform statutes giving great weight to evidence of federal approval of the product. For example, Texas has enacted a statute creating a rebuttable presumption that there is no defective design or warning when the manufacturer has “complied with mandatory safety standards or regulations adopted and promulgated by the federal government.” Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §82.008(a). Such a presumption is only rebuttable upon proof that the federal regulations were inadequate to protect the public or that the manufacturer lied to the government to obtain approval for the design or warning.</p>

<p id="6620527f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">As the court in the <i>Dawson</i> case mentioned, under the risk utility analysis, a jury need not find that each factor favors the existence of a defect. Instead, a balancing of the totality of these considerations is supposed to drive the jury’s verdict. Notwithstanding the general agreement with most courts of this concept, some jurisdictions have held that under the risk utility analysis a mandatory prerequisite for finding a design defect is the plaintiff’s proof of an alternative feasible product design. The <i>Grinnell</i> case, which we have previously reviewed in part with respect to manufacturing defects, addresses this evidentiary requirement in ruling upon the summary judgment granted to the tobacco company on the design defect claim.</p>

<p id="66205285-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[As set forth previously in this chapter as Part I, the decedent began smoking the defendant’s cigarettes in 1952 and contracted cancer 33 years later.

<p id="66205286-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The duty to design a safe product is “an obligation imposed by law.” <i>McKisson v. Sales Affiliates, Inc.</i>, 416 S.W.2d 787, 789 (Tex. 1967). Whether a seller has breached this duty, that is, whether a product is unreasonably dangerous, is a question of fact for the jury. <i>See Turner v. General Motors Corp.</i>, 584 S.W.2d 844, 848 (Tex. 1979). In determining whether a product is defectively designed, the jury must conclude that the product is unreasonably dangerous as designed, taking into consideration the utility of the product and the risk involved in its use.</p>
<p id="66205287-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Turner</i> we held that evidence of the following factors of risk and utility were admissible in design defect cases: (1) the utility of the product to the user and to the public as a whole weighed against the gravity and likelihood of injury from its use; (2) the availability of a substitute product which would meet the same need and not be unsafe or unreasonably expensive; (3) the manufacturer’s ability to eliminate the unsafe character of the product without seriously impairing its usefulness or significantly increasing its costs; (4) the user’s anticipated awareness of the dangers inherent in the product and their avoidability because of general public knowledge of the obvious condition of the product, or of the existence of suitable warnings or instructions; and (5) the expectations of the ordinary consumer. <i>Id.</i> at 846, 847. <i>See also Caterpillar, Inc.</i>, 911 S.W.2d at 384; <i>Boatland of Houston, Inc. v.

<p id="66205288-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">American argues that the common-knowledge defense bars the Grinnells’ design defect claims as a matter of law. But, as we stated in <i>Turner</i>, “the user’s anticipated awareness of the dangers inherent in the product and their avoidability because of general public knowledge of the obvious condition of the product,” and “the expectations of the ordinary consumer,” are but two factors for the jury to consider when determining whether a product was defectively designed. American’s attempt to invoke the common-knowledge defense is actually an attempt to invoke the “open and obvious defense” or “patent danger rule,” which this Court has rejected in design defect cases:</p>

<p id="66205289-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">A number of courts are of the view that obvious risks are not design defects which must be remedied. <i>See, e.g., Gray</i>, 771 F.2d 866, 870 (applying Mississippi law); <i>Delvaux v. Ford Motor Co.</i>, 764 F.2d 469, 474 (7th Cir. 1985) (applying Wisconsin law); <i>Young v. Tide Craft, Inc.</i>, 270 S.C. 453, 242 S.E.2d 671, 680 (1978). However, our Court has held that liability for a design defect may attach even if the defect is apparent. <i>Turner</i>, 584 S.W.2d at 850. Determining if a design is unreasonably dangerous requires balancing the utility of the product against the risks involved in its use. <i>Id.</i> at 847 &amp; n.1.</p></div>

<span title="782" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-782">p. 782</span>
<p id="6620528b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alternatively, American argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because no safer alternative cigarette design exists. In <i>Turner</i>, we held that “the availability of a substitute product which would meet the same need and not be unsafe or unreasonably expensive,” was one factor for juries to consider when determining whether a product was defectively designed. We reaffirmed this holding in <i>Caterpillar, Inc. v. Shears</i> by stating that “if there are no safer alternatives, a product is not unreasonably dangerous as a matter of law.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1083E_a3959580-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1083E_a3959580-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d">1</a></span>” 911 S.W.2d at 384. Accordingly, if there is no safer alternative to the cigarette manufactured by American, then its cigarettes are not unreasonably dangerous as a matter of law.</p>
<p id="6620799d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Grinnells assert that American’s cigarettes could have been made reasonably safer by filtration, and by reducing the amount of tobacco, tar, nicotine, and toxins in them. In making its argument that no reasonably safer alternative design exists, American relies on the testimony of the Grinnells’ experts, Drs. Greenberg, Stevens, and Ginzel.

<p id="662079a9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Differing List of Factors</i>.</b> Note that in the <i>Grinnell</i> case, the court identifies itself as a risk utility jurisdiction for purposes of analyzing a design defect case. Not all such jurisdictions recite an identical list of considerations, though they all tend to overlap significantly. The last factor identified by <i>Grinnell</i> actually incorporates the consumer expectation test into the risk utility analysis as one of the considerations. It thus represents a hybrid approach.</p>
<p id="6620a0ba-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Mandatory Proof of Alternative Feasible Design</i>.</b> The court indicates that both the court and the legislature had demanded that in design defect cases, the plaintiff offer evidence of an alternative feasible design that would provide essentially the same functions of the product, but in a safer and economically and technologically feasible manner. Courts that require this as an element of a design defect claim have held that the plaintiff need not actually build a prototype of the proposed alternative design but simply offer expert testimony showing the feasibility of such a design. See General Motors v. Sanchez, 997 S.W.2d 584, 592 (Tex. 1999) (“[P]laintiffs did not have to build an automobile transmission to prove a safer alternative design. A design need only prove ‘capable of being developed.’”). Not all courts agree that this one factor in the risk utility analysis requires proof of an alternative feasible design as a prerequisite for finding a defect. <i>See e.g.</i>, Potter v. Chicago Pneumatic Tool Co., 694 A.2d 1319 (Conn. 1997).</p>

<p id="6620a0bd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">In some cases, the choice between the consumer expectation test and the risk utility test might make no difference—when products are either so obviously flawed or well-designed that either test should yield the same verdict. But in other cases, the choice between the two tests might change the verdict. The following case offers a unique opportunity to gain one court’s insight into the difference between the two tests in the context of an actual case. In <i>Denny</i>, the plaintiff asserted both a strict liability design defect claim as well as a breach of warranty claim. The court found the two claims different enough to permit submission of both theories to the jury. New York utilizes the risk utility test for strict liability design defect claims but, in effect, uses a consumer expectation test for breach of warranty claims.

<p id="6620a0c4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Are the elements of New York’s causes of action for strict products liability and breach of implied warranty always coextensive? If not, can the latter be broader than the former? These are the core issues presented by the questions that the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has certified to us in this diversity action involving an allegedly defective vehicle. On the facts set forth by the Second Circuit, we hold that the causes of action are not identical and that, under the circumstances presented here, it is possible to be liable for breach of implied warranty even though a claim of strict products liability has not been satisfactorily established.</p>
<p id="6620a0c5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As stated by the Second Circuit, this action arises out of a June 9, 1986 accident in which plaintiff Nancy Denny was severely injured when the Ford Bronco II that she was driving rolled over. The rollover accident occurred when Denny slammed on her brakes in an effort to avoid a deer that had walked directly into her motor vehicle’s path. Denny and her spouse sued Ford Motor Co., the vehicle’s manufacturer, asserting claims for negligence, strict products liability and breach of implied warranty of merchantability. The case went to trial in the District Court for the Northern District of New York in October of 1992.</p>

<p id="6620a0c8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permits a plaintiff to join as many claims as desired against a particular defendant.

</div>
<p id="6620a0c9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial evidence centered on the particular characteristics of utility vehicles, which are generally made for off-road use on unpaved and often rugged terrain. Such use sometimes necessitates climbing over obstacles such as fallen logs and rocks. While utility vehicles are traditionally considerably larger than passenger cars, some manufacturers have created a category of down-sized “small” utility vehicles, which are designed to be lighter, to achieve better fuel economy and, presumably, to appeal to a wider consumer market. The Bronco II in which Denny was injured falls into this category.</p>
<p id="6620a0ca-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs introduced evidence at trial to show that small utility vehicles in general, and the Bronco II in particular, present a significantly higher risk of rollover accidents than do ordinary passenger automobiles. Plaintiffs’ evidence also showed <span title="785" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-785">p. 785</span>that the Bronco II had a low stability index attributable to its high center of gravity and relatively narrow track width. The vehicle’s shorter wheelbase and suspension system were additional factors contributing to its instability. Ford had made minor design changes in an effort to achieve a higher stability index, but, according to plaintiffs’ proof, none of the changes produced a significant improvement in the vehicle’s stability.</p>
<p id="6620c7db-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ford argued at trial that the design features of which plaintiffs complained were necessary to the vehicle’s off-road capabilities. According to Ford, the vehicle had been intended to be used as an off-road vehicle and had not been designed to be sold as a conventional passenger automobile. Ford’s own engineer stated that he would not recommend the Bronco II to someone whose primary interest was to use it as a passenger car, since the features of a four-wheel-drive utility vehicle were not helpful for that purpose and the vehicle’s design made it inherently less stable.</p>
<p id="6620c7dc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite the engineer’s testimony, plaintiffs introduced a Ford marketing manual which predicted that many buyers would be attracted to the Bronco II because utility vehicles were “suitable to contemporary life styles” and were “considered fashionable” in some suburban areas. According to this manual, the sales presentation of the Bronco II should take into account the vehicle’s “suitab[ility] for commuting and for suburban and city driving.” Additionally, the vehicle’s ability to switch between two-wheel and four-wheel drive would “be particularly appealing to women who may be concerned about driving in snow and ice with their children.” Plaintiffs both testified that the perceived safety benefits of its four-wheel-drive capacity were what attracted them to the Bronco II. They were not at all interested in its off-road use.</p>
<p id="6620c7dd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the close of the evidence, the District Court Judge submitted both the strict products liability claim and the breach of implied warranty claim, despite Ford’s objection that the two causes of action were identical. [The jury rejected the negligence claim and no appeal was taken as to it.] With respect to the strict products liability claim the court told the jury that “[a] manufacturer who places a product on the market in a defective condition is liable for injury which results from use of the product when the product is used for its intended or reasonably foreseeable purpose.” Further, the court stated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="6620c7de-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">A product is defective if it is not reasonably safe. It is not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendant knew or should have known of the product[’]s potential for causing injury to establish that the product was not reasonably safe. Rather, the plaintiffs must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a reasonable person…who knew of the product’s potential for causing injury and the existence of available alternative designs…would have concluded that such a product should not have been marketed in that condition. Such a conclusion should be reached after balancing the risks involved in using the product against the product[’]s usefulness and its costs against the risks, usefulness and costs of the alternative design as compared to the product defendant did market.</p>

<p id="6620c7e0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">The law implies a warranty by a manufacturer which places its product on the market that the product is reasonably fit for the ordinary purpose for which it was intended.

<p id="6620c7e1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiffs claim that the Bronco II was not fit for its ordinary purpose because of its alleged propensity to rollover and lack of warnings to the consumer of this propensity.</p></div>
<p id="6620c7e2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Neither party objected to the content of these charges.</p>
<p id="6620c7e3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In response to interrogatories, the jury found that the Bronco II was not “defective” and that defendant was therefore not liable under plaintiffs’ strict products liability cause of action. However, the jury also found that defendant had breached its implied warranty of merchantability and that the breach was the proximate cause of Nancy Denny’s injuries. Following apportionment of damages, plaintiff was awarded judgment in the amount of $1.2 million.</p>
<p id="6620c7e4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this proceeding, Ford’s sole argument is that plaintiffs’ strict products liability and breach of implied warranty causes of action were identical and that, accordingly, a defendant’s verdict on the former cannot be reconciled with a plaintiff’s verdict on the latter. This argument is, in turn, premised on both the intertwined history of the two doctrines and the close similarity in their elements and legal functions. Although Ford recognizes that New York has previously permitted personal injury plaintiffs to simultaneously assert different products liability theories in support of their claims, it contends that the breach of implied warranty cause of action, which sounds in contract, has been subsumed by the more recently adopted, and more highly evolved, strict products liability theory, which sounds in tort. Ford’s argument has much to commend it. However, in the final analysis, the argument is flawed because it overlooks the continued existence of a separate <i>statutory</i> predicate for the breach of warranty theory and the subtle but important distinction between the two theories that arises from their different historical and doctrinal root.</p>
<p id="6620c7e5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When products liability litigation was in its infancy, the courts relied upon contractual warranty theories as the only existing means of facilitating economic recovery for personal injuries arising from the use of defective. Eventually, the contractually based implied warranty theory came to be perceived as inadequate in an economic universe that was dominated by mass-produced products and an impersonal marketplace. Its primary weakness was, of course, its rigid requirement of a relationship of privity between the seller and the injured consumer—a requirement that often could not be satisfied. However, the warranty approach remained unsatisfactory, and the courts shifted their focus to the development of a new, more flexible tort cause of action: the doctrine of strict products liability.</p>
<p id="6620c7e6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The establishment of this tort remedy has, as this Court has recognized, significantly diminished the need to rely on the contractually based breach of implied warranty remedy as a means of compensating individuals injured because of defective products. Further, although the available defenses and <span title="787" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-787">p. 787</span>applicable limitations principles may differ, there is a high degree of overlap between the substantive aspects of the two causes of action. Indeed, on an earlier occasion, this Court observed, in dictum, that “strict liability in tort and implied warranty in the absence of privity are merely different ways of describing the very same cause of action.”</p>
<p id="6620c7e7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nonetheless, it would not be correct to infer that the tort cause of action has completely subsumed the older breach of implied warranty cause of action or that the two doctrines are now identical in every respect.</p>
<p id="6620c7e8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the products liability theory sounding in tort and the breach of implied warranty theory authorized by the UCC coexist and are often invoked in tandem, the core element of “defect” is subtly different in the two causes of action. Under New York law, a design defect may be actionable under a strict products liability theory if the product is not reasonably safe. [T]he New York standard for determining the existence of a design defect has required an assessment of whether “if the design defect were known at the time of manufacture, a reasonable person would conclude that the utility of the product did not outweigh the risk inherent in marketing a product designed in that manner.”</p>
<p id="6620c7e9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The adoption of this risk/utility balance as a component of the “defectiveness” element has brought the inquiry in design defect cases closer to that used in traditional negligence cases, where the reasonableness of an actor’s conduct is considered in light of a number of situational and policy-driven factors. While efforts have been made to steer away from the fault-oriented negligence principles by characterizing the design defect cause of action in terms of a product-based rather than a conduct-based analysis, the reality is that the risk/utility balancing test is a “negligence-inspired” approach, since it invites the parties to adduce proof about the manufacturer’s choices and ultimately requires the fact finder to make “a judgment about [the manufacturer’s] judgment.” In other words, an assessment of the manufacturer’s conduct is virtually inevitable, and, as one commentator observed, “[i]n general,…the strict liability concept of ‘defective design’ [is] functionally synonymous with the earlier negligence concept of unreasonable designing.”</p>
<p id="6620c7ea-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is this negligence-like risk/benefit component of the defect element that differentiates strict products liability claims from UCC-based breach of implied warranty claims in cases involving design defects. While the strict products concept of a product that is “not reasonably safe” requires a weighing of the product’s dangers against its over-all advantages, the UCC’s concept of a “defective” product requires an inquiry only into whether the product in question was “fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used.” The latter inquiry focuses on the expectations for the performance of the product when used in the customary, usual and reasonably foreseeable manners. The cause of action is one involving true “strict” liability, since recovery may be had upon a showing that the product was not minimally safe for its expected purpose—without regard to the feasibility of alternative designs or the manufacturer’s “reasonableness” in marketing it in that unsafe condition.</p>
<p id="6620c7eb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This distinction between the “defect” analysis in breach of implied warranty actions and the “defect” analysis in strict products liability actions is explained by the differing etiology and doctrinal underpinnings of the two distinct <span title="788" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-788">p. 788</span>theories. The former class of actions originates in contract law, which directs its attention to the purchaser’s disappointed expectations; the latter originates in tort law, which traditionally has concerned itself with social policy and risk allocation by means other than those dictated by the marketplace.</p>
<p id="6620eefc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Some] criticize the consumer-expectation-based tests for product defect and argue instead for the use of a risk/utility approach.…One of the cited commentators, for example, argues that the consumer expectation test is a “blunt instrument” “when it comes to recognizing and maximizing the…goals, objectives, interests and values <i>important to modern tort law</i>” (Kennedy, <i>The Role of the Consumer Expectation Test Under Louisiana’s Products Liability Tort Doctrine</i>, 69 Tul. L. Rev. 117, 152 [emphasis supplied]).</p>
<p id="6620eefd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Significantly, the consumer-expectation test has its advocates as well as its critics. In view of the “rigors of the risk-utility test,” it has been suggested that it is “worthwhile” to retain the consumer-expectation test…rather than simply abandoning it.</p>
<p id="6620eefe-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In any event, while the critics and commentators may debate the relative merits of the consumer-expectation and risk/utility tests, there is no existing authority for the proposition that the risk/utility analysis is appropriate when the plaintiff’s claim rests on a claimed breach of implied warranty under UCC 2-314(2)(c) and 2-318. Further,…the negligence-like risk/utility approach is foreign to the realm of contract law.</p>
<p id="6620eeff-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a practical matter, the distinction between the defect concepts in tort law and in implied warranty theory may have little or no effect in most cases. In this case, however, the nature of the proof and the way in which the fact issues were litigated demonstrates how the two causes of action can diverge. In the trial court, Ford took the position that the design features of which plaintiffs complain, i.e., the Bronco II’s high center of gravity, narrow track width, short wheel base and specially tailored suspension system, were important to preserving the vehicle’s ability to drive over the highly irregular terrain that typifies off-road travel. Ford’s proof in this regard was relevant to the strict products liability risk/utility equation, which required the fact finder to determine whether the Bronco II’s value as an off-road vehicle outweighed the risk of the rollover accidents that could occur when the vehicle was used for other driving tasks.</p>
<p id="6620ef00-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, plaintiffs’ proof focused, in part, on the sale of the Bronco II for suburban driving and everyday road travel. Plaintiffs also adduced proof that the Bronco II’s design characteristics made it unusually susceptible to rollover accidents when used on paved roads. All of this evidence was useful in showing that routine highway and street driving was the “ordinary purpose” for which the Bronco II was sold and that it was not “fit”—or safe—for that purpose.</p>
<p id="6620ef01-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, under the evidence in this case, a rational fact finder could have simultaneously concluded that the Bronco II’s utility as an off-road vehicle outweighed the risk of injury resulting from rollover accidents <i>and</i> that the vehicle was not safe for the “ordinary purpose” of daily driving for which it was marketed and sold. Under the law of this State such a set of factual judgments would lead to the concomitant legal conclusion that plaintiffs’ strict products liability <span title="789" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-789">p. 789</span>cause of action was not viable but that defendant should nevertheless be held liable for breach of its implied promise that the Bronco II was “merchantable” or “fit” for its “ordinary purpose.” Importantly, what makes this case distinctive is that the “ordinary purpose” for which the product was marketed and sold to the plaintiff was <i>not</i> the same as the utility against which the risk was to be weighed. It is these unusual circumstances that give practical significance to the ordinarily theoretical difference between the defect concepts in tort and statutory breach of implied warranty causes of action.</p>

Although the court believed there was substantial overlap between a strict liability design defect claim and a breach of warranty claim, it indicated that they had different definitions of “defect”—at least under the laws of many jurisdictions. If that jurisdiction had employed a consumer expectation test for a design defect, would it have made sense to submit a separate issue on the breach of warranty claim? Regarding the court’s suggestion that strict liability and negligence were almost one and the same, some scholars would agree. Some have suggested that it is foolishness to believe that a design defect claim is analyzed differently than a negligence claim, at least when the risk utility test is employed. Judge Posner made this argument in the context of Indiana law requiring proof of negligence in a design defect case:</p>

<p id="66213d31-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">There are instances where a product has great utility accompanied with risks for which no better design is available. While such products would not generally be considered to have a design defect, strict products liability law also recognizes that a marketing defect can exist when needed warnings are not properly given to consumers. In these cases, two primary areas of dispute concern (a) when is a warning required, and (b) what exactly must the warning say? When the plaintiff has suffered an injury from an intended or foreseeable use of the product, and no warning of this risk was given, the issue of liability for a marketing or warning defect is concentrated solely on the former issue. In some instances, however, the defendant has provided a warning of a known risk, but the plaintiff complains that the warning was not good enough. These two issues tend, in practice, to be mutually exclusive because it is difficult for a defendant who has given some warning of a particular risk to argue that no warning was necessary. In the following case, what is the nature of the defendant’s defense to the argument that the product was defective in its marketing?</p>

<p id="66213d3a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dearmedia Richter appeals from the district court’s grant of judgment as a matter of law to Limax International, Inc. and LMX-Manufactures Consultants, Inc. (collectively Limax). Richter claimed that repetitive use of a mini-trampoline manufactured by Limax caused stress fractures in her ankles. In March 1991, Richter sued Limax alleging the mini-trampoline was defectively designed and came with an inadequate warning. The jury found, in a special verdict, that <span title="791" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-791">p. 791</span>the mini-trampoline was not defectively designed. However, it nonetheless found Limax was liable under theories of strict liability and negligence for its failure to warn and determined damages to be $472,712 reduced by Richter’s percentage of fault of thirty-eight percent.</p>
<p id="6621644b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Limax then moved for judgment as a matter of law, which the court granted. The court concluded the defendant had no duty to warn because the plaintiff had failed to prove that Limax had knowledge of the danger of stress fractures or that the danger was known in the state of the art. The court further concluded that under these circumstances Kansas law does not impose a duty on manufacturers to warn about dangers they might have discovered by conducting reasonable tests. Richter appealed. We reverse and remand to the district court with instructions to reinstate the jury’s verdict and enter a judgment on the verdict.</p>
<p id="6621644c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Richter purchased a mini-trampoline from Limax on February 1, 1989. There were no instructions in or on the box containing the mini-trampoline, although the trampoline did have sticker on it stating: “This product was designed to be used only as an exercise device. It is not designed to be used for acrobatics, trampolining or any springboard type activities.” Richter stated she only used the trampoline for jogging. She began by jogging for short periods of time but eventually increased her time up to sixty minutes per day. She used the product until March 10, 1989. The next day she experienced severe pain in her ankles while walking. A doctor diagnosed her as having stress fractures in her ankles. Richter testified the pain forced her to discontinue her work as a sales representative for a furniture manufacturer.</p>
<p id="6621644d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff produced expert testimony which established relatively simple tests would have revealed that because the surface of a mini-trampoline depresses furthest in the center and decreasingly towards the edges, as a jogger’s feet strike the trampoline’s surface and it gives way, the inside of each foot drop further than the outside. This rotation of the foot, which is termed “eversion,” occurs to a lesser degree in normal jogging, but rebound jogging markedly accentuates the degree of rotation.</p>
<p id="6621644e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Further testimony established it has long been known that lateral pulling on a bone by ligaments or muscles can cause microscopic fractures. If the bone is not allowed time to heal and the stress on the bone continues, these tiny fractures can coalesce into a stress fracture. The eversion of the feet caused by the mini-trampoline results in certain tissues pulling laterally on particular ankle bones. Richter’s expert witnesses testified that long-term use of the trampoline could cause stress fractures in the affected anklebones.</p>
<p id="6621644f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Limax admitted it conducted no tests relating to the long-term effects of jogging on the mini-trampoline and did not systematically review published studies of mini-trampolines by sports medicine and exercise specialists. The CEO of Limax testified the company had sold approximately two million mini-trampolines world-wide and Richter’s complaint about stress fractures was the first Limax had received. Further, although mini-trampolines had been in use since 1975, by the time of Richter’s purchase no one had yet <span title="792" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-792">p. 792</span>suggested their use entailed a risk of stress fractures. No expert testifying at trial could identify any study or article on rebound jogging or mini-trampolines that reported ankle stress fractures or pointed out the risk joggers faced of incurring such an injury.</p>
<p id="66216450-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Richter, however, produced testimony by experts that observations from very simple tests, interpreted in light of well-established knowledge about the structure of the foot and the causes of stress fractures, would have made it apparent that the repetitive use of the mini-trampoline for jogging could cause stress fractures. Two experts testified the danger was well within the state of society’s knowledge about such matters. One of Richter’s experts pointed out that although there were no known reports concerning mini-trampolines as a cause of stress fractures, sport and exercise magazines as well as scientific and medical journals have long published articles establishing that repetitive jogging can cause stress fractures. The testimony verified that such repetitive jogging on a mini-trampoline exaggerates the stresses that result from repetitive jogging on a flat surface. Although the mini-trampoline was found by the jury not to have a defective design, Richter’s expert witness testimony established that the marked accentuation of eversion caused by the design of the mini-trampoline could result in her kind of injury developing from her repetitive jogging.</p>

<p id="66216453-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Richter contends Kansas law imposes a duty on manufacturers to test their products and warn consumers appropriately. In <i>Wooderson v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp.</i>, the Kansas Supreme Court held an ethical drug company had a duty to warn the medical profession about what “it knows, has reason to know, or should know, based upon its position as an expert in the field, upon its research, upon cases reported to it, and upon scientific development, research, and publications in the field.” 681 P.2d 1038, 1057 (Kan.), <i>cert. denied</i>, 469 U.S. 965 (1984). Richter interprets the language “upon its research,” to require manufacturers to test their products for their potential to injure consumers.</p>
<p id="66216454-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The district court held, “though not without misgivings,” that Kansas law does not require a manufacturer to test its products for dangers not otherwise <span title="793" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-793">p. 793</span>known in <i>the state of the art.</i> The court held that because the evidence indicated that prior to Richter’s injuries, no one was aware of the possibility that jogging on a mini-trampoline could cause stress fractures, there was nothing to give rise to a duty warn.</p>
<p id="66216455-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We find the district court’s restrictive interpretation is contrary to Kansas law on the duty of a manufacturer to warn consumers of foreseeable dangers. An earlier district court decision summed up Kansas law relating to the duty to warn consumers:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="66216456-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Ordinarily, a manufacturer has a duty under Kansas law to warn consumers and users of its products when it knows or has reason to know that its product is or is likely to be dangerous during normal use. The duty to warn is a continuous one, requiring the manufacturer to keep abreast of the current state of knowledge of its products as acquired through research, adverse reaction reports, scientific literature, and other available methods. A manufacturer’s failure to adequately warn of its product’s reasonably foreseeable dangers renders that product defective under the doctrine of strict liability.</p></div>

<p id="66218b68-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Kansas applies the same test to whether a manufacturer met his duty to warn under negligence as it does under strict liability.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A76_a3959580-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10A76_a3959580-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d">5</a></span></p>
<p id="66218b6a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Kansas law makes clear this general duty to warn consumers of foreseeable dangers is not limited to ethical drug companies. In 1976, Kansas adopted the rule set out in the Restatement (Second) of Torts §402A (1965) in <i>Brooks v. Dietz</i>, 545 P.2d 1104, 1108 (Kan. 1976), an adoption that has been repeatedly affirmed. Section 402A establishes strict liability for a seller of a product whose defective condition makes the product unreasonably dangerous. Comment <i>h</i> to section 402A states that where a seller “has reason to anticipate that danger may result from a particular use…he may be required to give adequate warning of the danger (see Comment <i>j</i>), and a product sold without such warning is in a defective condition.” Kansas courts have relied on both comments <i>j</i> and <i>k</i> to section 420A in concretizing the duty to warn announced in comment <i>h</i>.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A97_a3959580-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10A97_a3959580-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d">7</a></span></p>

These comments make clear that a product may not be defectively designed, but may nonetheless be defective because the manufacturer failed to adequately warn the users of the product of a reasonably foreseeable hazard. The Kansas Supreme Court in <i>Savina</i> stated this proposition as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="66218b71-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Under the strict liability theory, a plaintiff is not required to establish misconduct by the maker or seller but, instead, is required to impugn the product. The plaintiff must show the product is in “a defective condition unreasonably dangerous,” which means that it must be defective in a way that subjects persons or tangible property to an unreasonable risk of harm. Prosser and Keeton, Law of Torts §99, p. 695 (5th ed. 1984) A product can be defective in one of the following three ways: (1) a flaw is present in the product at the time it is sold; (2) <i>the Producer or assembler of the product fails to adequately warn of a risk or hazard related to the way the product was designed;</i> or (3) the product, although perfectly manufactured, contains a defect that makes it unsafe. Prosser, §99, pp. 695-98.</p></div>
<p id="66218b72-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">795 P.2d at 923 (emphasis added).</p>
<p id="66218b73-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The district court’s restriction of the general duty to warn to specific design defects overlooks that under Kansas law of strict liability, even if a product does not have a design defect, failure to warn of a foreseeable danger arising from the product’s normal use makes the product defective.</p>
<p id="66218b74-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The mini-trampoline was specifically intended for exercise, and in particular, for jogging. When used for this purpose, however, the mini-trampoline’s design results in the foot turning in a way that places stress on the anklebones. That the design is not defective, within the state of the known art, does not detract from the manufacturer’s duty to warn the consumer of foreseeable dangers that can arise from normal use.</p>
<p id="66218b75-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given that repetitive jogging on the mini-trampoline could cause stress fractures, the question becomes whether Richter presented sufficient evidence that a jury could permissibly conclude reasonable tests would have been effective in bringing this danger to light. Richter presented a substantial amount of expert testimony to the effect that visual observation of a person jogging on the mini-trampoline by someone with expertise in biomechanics, would reveal eversion and further that relatively simple tests could measure the degree of eversion. A comparison of that measurement with a measurement of the eversion caused by jogging on a flat surface would have revealed mini-trampolines cause users’ feet to evert to a markedly greater degree. Testimony established that it is well known that such stresses, experienced on a repetitive basis, could cause <span title="795" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-795">p. 795</span>fractures. We hold the jury could have reasonably found Richter’s injury was causally related to repetitive jogging on the mini-trampoline, the use for which Limax’s product was intended. The jury could also reasonably have concluded Limax should have warned users of this danger because the danger was eminently knowable given the state of the art and Limax should have known of it.</p>

<p id="6621b289-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under Kansas law, both strict liability and negligence require warnings only for dangers which are reasonably foreseeable in light of the intended use of a product. The jury could reasonably have concluded that a simple consultation with a biomechanics expert would have given Limax sufficient information to arrange for appropriate testing of the mini-trampoline. No expert witness for either side expressed any doubt that the mini-trampoline accentuates eversion of the ankles or that eversion could cause stress fractures. It is true that no one appears to have considered the problem until Richter’s injury occurred, but it is also true that plaintiff’s evidence demonstrated that the danger was patently obvious to any expert who had a reason to look for it. The jury could permissibly conclude Limax should reasonably have foreseen that design of the mini-trampoline could result in the harm produced. Limax conceded that it did no testing or research to consider foreseeable harm arising out of the uses to which the mini-trampoline would be put.</p>
<p id="6621b28a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Manufacturers do not have a duty to test for inconceivable dangers, nor do they have a duty to test for every conceivable danger. They do have a duty to warn of dangers of harmful effects arising from the foreseeable use and misuse of a product that are known or are readily foreseeable in the state of art. In any given case, plaintiff’s evidence must sufficiently demonstrate that the harm incurred should have been reasonably foreseeable to the manufacturer of the product. Absent such proof a manufacturer cannot be held liable for harm that no reasonable person could anticipate.</p>
<p id="6621b28b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Every case must turn on its own evidentiary facts. In the present case, plaintiff’s experts testified that the accentuated eversion of the foot caused by prolonged jogging on the mini-trampoline made Richter’s injury foreseeable and that the manufacturer should have warned the user of the product of the possible foreseeable harm she encountered. We do not make this ruling as a matter of law. We simply find that there existed substantial evidence in the record from which the jury could find that the harm was foreseeable. As earlier stated, we must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict holder. A fair and impartial jury concluded under the evidence that because of the specific <span title="796" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-796">p. 796</span>design of the mini-trampoline, Richter’s harm was foreseeable. We simply conclude there was sufficient evidence to allow the jury to make that finding.</p>
<p id="6621b28c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We find that the district court erred in granting a judgment as a matter of law and we therefore hold that the verdict and judgment in favor of the plaintiff should be reinstated.</p>
<p id="6621b28d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On cross appeal, Limax…contends Richter made no showing as to whether the warning would have been effective in avoiding her injury.</p>
<p id="6621b28e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Under] Kansas law, an inadequate warning creates a “presumption of causation.” <i>O’Gilvie v. International Playtex, Inc.</i>, 821 F.2d 1438, 1442 (10th Cir. 1987) (citing <i>Wooderson</i>, 681 P.2d at 1057). Limax insists that because the jury heard no evidence as to what an adequate warning might have been, the jury had no basis for deciding a warning would have been effective. Limax contends that to establish causation, Richter should have had to testify she would have behaved differently had she been warned. Kansas does not require such self-serving testimony from plaintiffs and Limax’s argument entirely ignores that the effect of the presumption is to place the burden on Limax to rebut it.

<p id="6621b292-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Duty to Warn</i>.</b> According to the Restatement (Third), a product has a marketing defect “because of inadequate instructions or warnings when the foreseeable risks of harm posed by the product could have been reduced or avoided by the provision of reasonable instructions or warnings by the seller or other distributor…and the omission of the instructions or warnings renders the product not reasonably safe.” §2(c) (1998).</p>
<p id="6621b293-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Negligence Revisited</i>.</b> Of all of the areas of strict products liability, the defective marketing (or warning) area overlaps most with negligence law. The court above quotes Kansas courts as holding that negligence and strict liability for marketing defects are one and the same. With respect to manufacturing and design defects, where would those fit on the continuum of negligence law versus true strict (no fault) liability?</p>
<p id="6621b294-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Design and Marketing Defect Claims</i>.</b> A defective marketing claim might be made in conjunction with a design defect claim or independently. In the <i>Limax</i> case above, the plaintiff sued on both theories though the jury rejected the defective design claim. Can you understand why, at least in a risk-utility jurisdiction, it might be difficult to prevail on a defective design of a min-trampoline claim? Exactly how else could a mini-trampoline be designed to avoid the “eversion” referred to in the case? On the other hand, even a product <span title="797" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-797">p. 797</span>with a proper design might still have foreseeable risks associated with its use. In these instances, the product will still be considered defective if it lacks a reasonably adequate warning of those foreseeable risks.</p>
<p id="6621b295-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Read and Heed Presumption</i>.</b> Courts have recognized a “read and heed” presumption to help facilitate the plaintiff’s proof of causation in cases where no warning has been given. Because plaintiff must demonstrate that any defect caused the plaintiff’s physical harm, this doctrine provides that if the required warning had been given, the plaintiff would have read it and abided by the warning to protect herself from the injury. This presumption thus helps the plaintiff in such a case to prove actual causation from the failure to warn. However, it is a <i>rebuttable</i> presumption, meaning that defendants are allowed to try to persuade the fact finder that, had the necessary warning been given, a particular plaintiff would have still disregarded it, making the failure to warn immaterial. In such instances, there is no causal link between the product defect and the plaintiff’s harm and so no liability attaches.</p>
<p id="6621b296-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. <i>Learned Intermediary Doctrine</i>.</b> In most cases, the duty to warn is satisfied when a reasonably adequate warning is given to the consumer (often with instructions accompanying the product or on the packaging itself). However, under the learned intermediary doctrine, the duty to warn is satisfied with respect to <i>prescription</i> drugs and devices by providing the warning to the physician instead. The law presumes that the physician can decipher such warnings and decide in her professional judgment what information needs to be shared with the patient when prescribing the drugs or device:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">

It is settled in a substantial majority of jurisdictions that the duty a manufacturer of ethical drugs owes to the consumer is to warn only physicians (or other medical personnel permitted by state law to prescribe drugs) of any risks or contra-indications associated with that drug.</p></div>

Interestingly, some courts have held that the learned intermediary doctrine no longer insulates sellers of prescription drugs from liability where they have engaged in the direct marketing of such drugs to the consumers (through advertisements) because the sellers are trying to influence the consumers directly. <i>See e.g.</i>, Perez v. Wyeth Laboratories, 734 A.2d 1245 (N.J. 1999) (“The direct marketing of drugs to consumers generates a corresponding duty requiring manufacturers to warn of defects in the product”). <i>But cf.</i> In re Norplant Contraceptive Prods.

<p id="6621d9ab-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Tort law has a practical component to many of its doctrines. One of those practical principles concerns a disdain for requiring unnecessary action. In Chapter 6, Special Duty Rules, we encountered the <i>open and obvious danger doctrine</i> that eliminates any duty by a premises owner to eliminate or warn about dangerous conditions on the land of which an ordinary person would obviously be aware. With respect to strict liability claims for defecting marketing, tort law has come up with an analogous exception to the normal duty to provide warnings about the risks arising from the intended or foreseeable uses of products. This <i>common knowledge</i> defense is applied in the <i>Grinnell</i> case, which we have already encountered in both the manufacturing defect and design defect sections. Pay close attention to the subtle distinction the court makes between two different risks of smoking as we visit this case one final time.</p>

Texas Indus., Inc.</i>, 696 S.W.2d 372, 377 (Tex. 1984).

Saenz</i>, 873 S.W.2d 353, 356 (Tex. 1993). Generally, a manufacturer has a duty to warn if it knows or should know of the potential harm to a user because of the nature of its product. <i>Bristol-Myers Co. v. Gonzales</i>, 561 S.W.2d 801, 804 (Tex. 1978). Nevertheless, this Court has recognized that there is no duty to warn when the risks associated with a particular product are matters “within the ordinary knowledge common to the community.” <i>Joseph E.

McGuire</i>, 814 S.W.2d 385, 388 (Tex. 1991) (holding that no legal duty exists to warn of the health risks of alcohol consumption because such risks are common knowledge).

<p id="6621d9bd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, we do not find the dangers of alcohol and cigarettes, or the public’s awareness of those respective dangers, to be commensurate. Unlike Seagram &amp; Sons, which did not dispute the health dangers of prolonged alcohol use, the tobacco industry, including American, actively disputed that cigarettes posed any health risk at the time Grinnell began smoking in 1952. Indeed, the industry continues to dispute the health risks of smoking and the addictive nature of cigarettes, before Congress, in the national press, and even at oral argument before the Court in this case. Despite this ongoing “dispute,” we are bound to apply the rule that whether knowledge has become common to the community is an objective determination. <i>See Caterpillar, Inc. v. Shears</i>, 911 S.W.2d 379, 383 (Tex. 1995).</p>
<p id="6621d9be-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The party asserting the common-knowledge defense must establish that the dangers attributable to alcohol, tobacco, or other products were a matter of common knowledge when the consumer began using the product.

However, we also hold that American did not establish that the addictive quality of cigarettes was commonly known when Grinnell began smoking in 1952.</p>

<p id="662200d2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, by 1962, when the Surgeon General’s advisory committee began examining the health risks associated with smoking, there were already more than seven thousand publications of professional and general circulation examining the relationship between smoking and health. Of these publications, articles published in nationally circulated magazines dating back to the early 1900s informed readers about the deleterious effects of smoking. Brown, <i>Is a Tobacco Crusade Coming?</i>, Atlantic Monthly, Oct. 1920, at 447 (adverse medical science findings on smoking have been brought before the public for the past thirty years); <i>Does Tobacco Make One Tired?</i>, The Literary Digest, Apr. 15, 1922, at 27 (noting the effect of heavy smoking, light smoking, and nonsmoking on workers’ efficiency); Hirshberg, <i>Truth About Tobacco</i>, Harper’s Weekly, Jan. 4, 1913 (consumer awareness of claims linking smoking to cancer, health disease, and bronchitis is pervasive); Norr, <i>Cancer by the Carton</i>, Reader’s Digest, Dec. 1952, at 7 (examining data and projecting the number of future lung cancer deaths from smoking).</p>
<p id="662200d3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During this same period, many books examined the health risks associated with smoking and argued against the use of cigarettes.…These books and articles published before 1952 indicate that the general dangers of smoking were common knowledge even before Grinnell began smoking. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Crist &amp; Majoras, <i>The “New” Wave in Smoking and Health Litigation—Is Anything Really So New?</i>, 54 Tenn. L. Rev. 551, 553 (1987) (“Even prior to the beginning of this century,…the public [was] constantly exposed to innumerable reports associating smoking with health risks.”); Henderson &amp; Twerski, <i>Closing the American Products Liability Frontier: The Rejection of Liability Without Defect</i>, 66 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1263, 1325 (1991) (“The amount of information available to American consumers about the dangers of smoking is, and for some while has been, staggering.”).</p>
<p id="662200d4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not only does historical evidence illustrate the public’s pre-1952 awareness of smoking’s dangerous effects, but the Grinnells’ experts also confirmed that the health hazards of smoking were common knowledge when Grinnell began smoking. Dr. Ravenholt, an expert on cancer and its causes, testified that the dangers of smoking were well known by the 1950s: “I think the majority [of people] would have been aware, you know, an adult, reasonably intelligent.” He also testified that, in 1950, “evidence emerged of the lung cancer producing capability of smoking” and that the dangers attributable to smoking were extensively published and frequently front-page news stories in the 1950s. Dr. Greenberg likewise testified that the decision to smoke or refrain from <span title="802" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-802">p. 802</span>smoking cigarettes is a matter of “individual personal responsibility” in light of the health risks.</p>
<p id="662200d5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that the general health dangers attributable to cigarettes were commonly known as a matter of law by the community when Grinnell began smoking. <i>See Caterpillar, Inc. v. Shears</i>, 911 S.W.2d at 383 (common knowledge is usually determined as a matter of law).</p>
<p id="662200d6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We cannot conclude, however, that the specific danger of nicotine addiction was common knowledge when Grinnell began smoking. Addiction is a danger apart from the direct physical dangers of smoking because the addictive nature of cigarettes multiplies the likelihood of and contributes to the smoker’s ultimate injury, in Grinnell’s case, lung cancer. <i>See</i> Garner, <i>Cigarette Dependency and Civil Liability: A Modest Proposal</i>, 53 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1423, 1430 (1980) (“Dependency adds a new dimension to smoking, for it greatly increases the likelihood of high volume, long term use which leads to disease, disability, and early death.”). This Court has also recognized the seriousness of addiction and the need for manufacturers to warn of this danger in the context of prescription drugs. <i>Crocker v. Winthrop Labs.</i>, 514 S.W.2d 429, 432-33 (Tex. 1974) (holding drug manufacturer liable under <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> §402B for misrepresenting that drug “was free and safe from all dangers of addiction”); <i>see also Carlisle v. Philip Morris, Inc.</i>, 805 S.W.2d 498, 516 (Tex. App.—Austin 1991, writ denied) (“Indeed, the failure to warn of cigarettes’ addictive nature could be the essence of a plaintiff’s complaint.”). We acknowledge that some authorities support the proposition that some members of the community associated addiction with smoking cigarettes earlier in this century. <i>Ploch v. City of St. Louis</i>, 345 Mo. 1069, 138 S.W.2d 1020, 1023 (Mo. 1940) (cigarettes have “harmful properties” and it is common knowledge that nicotine produces “tobacco addicts”); Wiley, <i>The Little White Slaver</i>, Good Housekeeping, Jan. 1916, at 91 (people can become “slaves” to the cigarette habit and cigarette smoking can “shorten their lives”).</p>
<p id="662200d7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Surgeon General spoke to the addictive nature of tobacco in the most recent and comprehensive report on the subject in 1988. In that report, the Surgeon General concluded that: (1) cigarettes and other forms of tobacco are addicting, (2) nicotine is the drug in tobacco that causes addiction, and (3) the pharmacologic and behavioral processes that determine tobacco addiction are similar to those that determine addiction to drugs such as heroin and cocaine. More recently, the Food and Drug Administration has concluded that tobacco products are addictive.</p>
<p id="662200d8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But we cannot simply assume that common knowledge of the general health risks of tobacco use naturally includes common knowledge of tobacco’s addictive quality. Indeed, as David Kessler, former head of the FDA, has pointed out:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="662200d9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Before 1980, when FDA last considered its jurisdiction over tobacco products, <i>no</i> major public health organization had determined that nicotine was an addictive drug. Today, however, <i>all</i> major public health organizations in the United States and abroad with expertise in tobacco or drug addiction recognize that the nicotine delivered by cigarettes and smokeless tobacco is addictive.</p></div>
<span title="803" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-803">p. 803</span>
<p id="662200da-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The FDA based its 1996 assertion of jurisdiction on “a wealth of epidemiologic and laboratory data establishing that tobacco users display the clinical symptoms of addiction and that nicotine has the characteristics of other addictive drugs.” Thus, unlike the general dangers associated with smoking, as late as 1988 and certainly in 1952, the danger of addiction from smoking cigarettes was not widely known and recognized in the community in general, or, particularly, by children or adolescents. The FDA has explained that because of tobacco’s addictive effects, the only way to prevent the ensuing disease and death is to prevent children and adolescents from starting to use tobacco: “Most people who suffer the adverse health consequences of using cigarettes and smokeless tobacco begin their use before they reach the age of 18, an age when they are not prepared for, or equipped to, make a decision that, for many, will have lifelong consequences.”</p>
<p id="662200db-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the community’s knowledge concerning the danger of nicotine addiction associated with cigarettes was not beyond dispute in 1952, the <i>Seagram</i> standard for finding common knowledge as a matter of law has not been met. We agree with the court in <i>Rogers v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.</i>:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="662200dc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">There is no basis for our judicially noticing what the ordinary consumer’s knowledge concerning the addictive qualities of cigarettes may have been when [the plaintiff] began smoking in 1940.

It was not until 1988 that the Surgeon General published a report informing of the addictive nature of cigarettes.</p></div>

<p id="662200de-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because we conclude that American did not conclusively establish that the danger of addiction to nicotine was common knowledge, the Grinnells may maintain their strict liability marketing defect claims to the extent they are based on the addictive qualities of cigarettes, if no other defenses defeat those claims.</p>
<p id="662200df-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Grinnells assert that American breached its duty to warn users about it product’s addictive nature because before January 1, 1966, the product’s packages contained no warnings. A manufacturer is required to give an adequate warning if it knows or should know that potential harm may result from use of the product. <i>Bristol-Myers Co. v. Gonzales</i>, 561 S.W.2d 801, 804 (Tex. 1978). In the absence of a warning, a <i>rebuttable</i> presumption arises that the “user would have read and heeded such warnings and instructions.” <i>Magro v. Ragsdale Bros., Inc.</i>, 721 S.W.2d 832, 834 (Tex. 1986) (citing <i>Technical Chem. Co. v. Jacobs</i>, 480 S.W.2d 602, 606 (Tex. 1972)). A manufacturer may rebut the presumption with evidence that the plaintiff did not heed whatever warnings were given, or would not have heeded any proposed warnings. <i>See Magro</i>, 721 S.W.2d at 834; <i>see also GeneralMotors Corp. v. Saenz</i>, 873 S.W.2d 353, 358-59 (Tex. 1993).</p>
<span title="804" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-804">p. 804</span>
<p id="662200e0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Grinnells assert that when Grinnell started smoking in 1952 he did not know and had heard nothing about any risk of addiction associated with smoking. The Grinnells further assert that American’s failure to warn of the addictive nature of cigarettes caused Grinnell’s eventual death because Grinnell testified that had he known what he later learned, he would never have started smoking. In rebuttal, American cites testimony that in the late 1950s and the 1960s, Grinnell continued smoking despite warnings from his father, coaches, and friends.</p>
<p id="662200e1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At most, the evidence relied on by American establishes that some people warned Grinnell about the general dangers of smoking. It does not conclusively establish that had Grinnell been warned that cigarettes were addictive <i>before</i> he began smoking he would have refused to follow the warnings. Grinnell testified at his deposition that if he had known of the dangers associated with smoking, including addiction, he never would have <i>started</i> smoking. At the very least, this testimony creates a fact issue regarding whether Grinnell would have heeded warnings had they been given to him before he began smoking. Dr. Grabowski, an expert on addiction, testified that Grinnell was addicted to cigarettes by the late 1950s and early 1960s and could not have stopped smoking without “intensive intervention.” In short, American’s summary judgment evidence does not conclusively establish that adequate warnings would not have been followed and thus would not have “made a difference in the outcome.” Summary judgment on the Grinnells’ marketing defect theory related to the addictive nature of cigarettes was therefore improper.</p>
<p id="662200e2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, to the extent we hold that the general health risks of smoking were within the knowledge common to the community even before Grinnell began smoking in 1952, American has established that its cigarettes were not unreasonably dangerous. Summary judgment was, therefore, proper to the extent the Grinnells’ strict liability claims relate to the general health risks associated with smoking. However, we also hold that American did not establish as a matter of law that the specific danger of addiction from smoking was knowledge common to the community. Therefore, we hold that the Grinnells’ marketing defect claim survives to the extent it is based on the allegation that the addictive nature of cigarettes rendered American’s products unreasonably dangerous, and to the extent it is not preempted by federal law.</p>

<p id="662227f8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Knowledge as a Creator and Destroyer of Duty</i>.</b> The foreseeability of a risk of harm associated with the use of a product can be seen on a continuum as both the creator and destroyer of a duty to warn. On the one hand, tort law requires there to be some foreseeable risk of harm associated with the product—at least in the so-called “state of the art”—as a prerequisite for imposing any obligation (or duty) to warn about the uses of the product. But where that knowledge rises to the level of undisputed common knowledge, the duty to warn is eviscerated.</p>

<p id="66222800-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Some defenses apply equally to strict products liability claims as they do to any other tort claim. For example, a plaintiff’s delinquency in filing a strict liability claim gives rise to a defense under the applicable statute of limitations (as covered in Chapter 7). Other defenses are unique to products claims. As was discussed in <i>Dawson</i>, a federal statute might be interpreted to expressly or implicitly preempt the availability of state law products liability claims. Or a state might give presumptive or controlling weight to the federal government’s approval of a manufacturer’s design or warning. All of these defenses, both general to any tort suit and unique to a products liability claim, have already been discussed. What remains for our consideration, however, is the extent to which defenses based upon a claimant’s <i>misconduct</i> might be recognized in a strict liability products suit.</p>
<span title="806" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-806">p. 806</span>
<p id="66222801-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Initially at common law, courts uniformly refused to recognize any general act of negligence by a claimant as even a partial defense to a claim for strict liability. Punishing the plaintiff for her misconduct seemed repugnant to the goal of holding the defendant absolutely liable—such refusal to recognize contributory negligence applying with equal force to <i>all varieties of strict liability claims</i>, whether involving wild animals, unusually dangerous activities or defective products. This rule of law was adopted at a time when any degree of negligence by the claimant acted as a complete defense. Nevertheless, courts were willing to recognize qualified (i.e., unreasonable) secondary implied assumption of risk as a complete defense. Further, in a strict products liability lawsuit, courts likewise recognized product misuse as an additional complete defense.</p>
<p id="66222802-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With almost all jurisdictions shifting to comparative fault, courts began to reexamine these traditional rules for blaming the plaintiff. Some courts have steadfastly refused to change their view of defenses in strict liability cases while others have embraced the application of comparative fault (and the elimination of secondary implied assumption of the risk as a separate defense) to strict liability suits. This section will first examine the ongoing debate over whether to recognize negligence as a defense to a strict liability claim. The <i>Bowling</i> and <i>Daly</i> cases contain excellent contrary opinions on this question. Finally, we will look at the continuing role that the defense of product misuse has in strict products liability suits.</p>

<p id="66224e1a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant, Emma K. Bowling, brought this action against appellee, the Heil Company (“Heil”), among others, in her representative capacity as the administratrix of the estate of her husband, David B. Bowling, seeking to recover damages for his alleged wrongful death. Bowling died when he was crushed between the chassis of a truck and the dump bed mounted onto it.</p>
<p id="66224e1b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Heil is engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling dump truck beds and hydraulic dump hoist systems designed to be installed on the chassis of trucks produced by various truck manufacturers. Heil does not install its dump beds and hoist systems; rather, it sells them to authorized distributors who install them onto the chassis of trucks selected by their customers.</p>
<p id="66224e1c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In May 1979, Ralph Rogers purchased the dump truck at issue for use in his backhoe business. The truck was equipped with a Heil 1617 DL dump hoist system, which included a dump bed, a hydraulic hoist, and a hydraulic pump valve assembly.</p>
<p id="66224e1d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As originally mounted, the 1617 DL system utilized a cable control system linking the truck cab controls to the hydraulic pump valve. Rogers was <span title="807" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-807">p. 807</span>dissatisfied with the operation of the cable control system, however, and returned the truck to [the seller,] Sweeney, requesting that a lever control system be installed. Sweeney contacted Robco, Inc. (“Robco”), another Heil distributor, and Robco replaced the cable control system with a lever control system, which had also been manufactured by Heil. The failure of one of Robco’s welds made while installing the lever control system triggered the tragic series of events culminating in David Bowling’s death.</p>
<p id="66224e1e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On April 26, 1980, [the truck was being used to move five tons of gravel. One of the individuals using the truck] pushed the in-cab control lever forward to lower the dump bed, but due to the failure of Robco’s weld, the bed would not come down. David Bowling, [who was present and assisting in the job], leaned over the chassis, underneath the raised bed, to investigate the problem. Bowling reached in with his hand and grabbed the control lever on the pump valve assembly, and when he manually manipulated it the dump bed rapidly descended upon him, killing him instantly.</p>
<p id="66224e1f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant proceeded against Heil on [a theory of] strict liability in tort. The jury returned a verdict in favor of appellant against Heil and assessed damages at $1.75 million. Upon written interrogatories, the jury determined that Heil was strictly liable, that Bowling was contributorily negligent but that he had not assumed a known risk, and [apportioned 30% of the loss to Bowling].</p>
<p id="66224e20-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Based on the jury’s findings, the trial court entered judgment against Heil for $1.75 million plus funeral costs, less those amounts previously received by appellant by way of settlement with [Sweeney and Robco].

<p id="66224e23-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Included in the body of Ohio law governing products liability is an analysis of the defenses available in actions involving allegedly defective products. Currently, two affirmative defenses based upon a plaintiff’s misconduct are recognized. First, an otherwise strictly liable defendant has a complete defense if the plaintiff voluntarily and knowingly assumed the risk occasioned by the defect. Second, such a defendant is also provided with a complete defense if the plaintiff misused the product in an unforeseeable manner.</p>
<p id="66224e24-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court of appeals below, construing Comment <i>n</i> to Section 402A, attempted to distinguish between negligent “affirmative action” by a plaintiff and negligent <i>passive</i> conduct by him in failing either to discover a defect or to guard against the possibility of its existence. The court held that although a plaintiff’s passive contributory negligence provides no defense to a products liability action, his contributorily negligent “affirmative action” does provide a <span title="808" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-808">p. 808</span>defense, and that such affirmative negligence should be compared by a jury to the fault of a strictly liable manufacturer of a defective product, in a manner similar to the principles of comparative negligence.</p>

On the other hand the form of contributory negligence which consists in voluntarily and unreasonably proceeding to encounter a known danger, and commonly passes under the name of assumption of risk, is a defense under this Section as in other cases of strict liability. If the user or consumer discovers the defect and is aware of the danger, and nevertheless proceeds unreasonably to make use of the product and is injured by it, he is barred from recovery.</p></div>
<p id="66224e27-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court of appeals has carved out a middle ground, to wit: contributory negligence consisting of “affirmative action,” theoretically located between a plaintiff’s failure to discover or guard against a defect and his voluntary assumption of a known risk. There is no such middle ground. Comment <i>n</i> covers the entire spectrum of conduct which can be termed “contributory negligence,” as applicable to products liability actions. That spectrum begins with a mere failure to discover a defect in a product, continues with a failure to guard against the existence of a defect, and concludes with an assumption of the risk of a known defect. “Affirmative action” by the plaintiff is not left uncovered. Failure to guard against a defect can be “affirmative action.” Indeed such would describe the conduct of David Bowling in this case.</p>
<p id="66224e28-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under Comment <i>n</i>, either a plaintiff’s contributory negligence amounts to a voluntary assumption of a known risk, or it does not. If it does, then that conduct provides an otherwise strictly liable defendant with a complete defense. If it does not, the contributory negligence of the plaintiff provides no defense.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10DF0_a3959580-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10DF0_a3959580-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d">3</a></span></p>
<p id="66224e2a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the case <i>sub judice</i>, the jury found that Bowling was contributorily negligent but that he had not assumed a known risk. Therefore, his contributory negligence did not provide Heil with a defense to appellant’s strict liability claim.</p>
<p id="66224e2b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, the absence of support in either the Restatement or existing Ohio law for the recognition of comparative negligence as a defense to strict liability does not preclude this court from adopting comparative negligence principles as part of the law of products liability.

We now turn to a consideration of the public policy underlying the application of strict liability in tort to products liability cases, in order to demonstrate why such modification is not appropriate.</p>
<p id="66224e2c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dean Prosser has [explained the goals of strict products liability in these] terms:</p>

<p id="6622753d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">The costs of damaging events due to defectively dangerous products can best be borne by the enterprisers who make and sell these products. <i>Those who are merchants and especially those engaged in the manufacturing enterprise have the capacity to distribute the losses of the few among the many who purchase the products</i>. It is not a ‘deep pocket’ theory but rather a ‘risk-bearing economic’ theory. The assumption is that the manufacturer can shift the costs of accidents to purchasers for use by charging higher prices for the costs of products.</p></div>

<p id="6622753f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under negligence principles, on the other hand, liability is determined according to <i>fault</i>. In negligence, we seek to make the person or persons responsible for causing a loss pay for it. In other words, we “blame” the loss on the negligent party or parties because it was they who could have avoided the loss by conforming to due care. Conversely, in strict liability in tort we hold the manufacturer or seller of a defective product responsible, not because it is “blameworthy,” but because it is more able than the consumers to spread that loss among those who use and thereby benefit from the product.</p>
<p id="66227540-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We recognize that strict liability cannot be absolutely divorced from traditional concepts of fault. In a sense we “blame” the loss on the manufacturer or seller because it introduced the defective product into the marketplace. However, it must be reemphasized that strict liability is at odds with traditional notions of due care.</p>
<p id="66227541-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, the public policy and goals underlying strict liability differ in important respects from those underlying the law of negligence.</p>
<p id="66227542-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Comparative negligence or comparative fault has been applied in products liability cases by a number of courts, both in states that have comparative negligence statutes and in states where comparative negligence was judicially adopted. See, <i>e.g., Duncan v. Cessna Aircraft Co</i>. (Tex. 1984), 665 S.W.2d 414; <i>Mulherin v. Ingersoll-Rand Co</i>. (Utah 1981), 628 P.2d 1301; <i>Daly v. General Motors Corp</i>., 575 P.2d 1162 (Cal. 1978). On the other hand, numerous courts have refused to apply comparative negligence principles to products liability cases.

Thus when a faulty design or otherwise defective product is involved, the litigation should not be diverted to consideration of the negligence of the plaintiff. The liability issues are simple: was the product or its design faulty, did the defendant inject the defective product into the stream of commerce, and did the defect cause the injury? The conduct of the ultimate consumer-victim who used the product in the contemplated or foreseeable manner is wholly irrelevant to those issues.</p></div>

Thus, the case involves a so-called “second collision” in which the “defect” did not contribute to the original impact, but only to the “enhancement” of injury.</p>
<p id="66229c60-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Over plaintiffs’ objections, defendants were permitted to introduce evidence [of the decedent’s intoxication and failure to utilize either the seat belt or the door locks].</p>
<p id="66229c61-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In response to plaintiffs’ assertion that the “intoxication-nonuse” evidence was improperly admitted, defendants contend that the deceased’s own conduct contributed to his death. Because plaintiffs’ case rests upon strict products liability based on improper design of the door latch and because defendants assert a failure in decedent’s conduct, namely, his alleged intoxication and nonuse of safety equipment, without which the accident and ensuing death would not have occurred, there is thereby posed the overriding issue in the case, should comparative principles apply in strict products liability actions?</p>
<p id="66229c62-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It may be useful to refer briefly to certain highlights in the historical development of the two principles—strict and comparative liability. Tort law has evolved from a legal obligation initially imposed without “fault,” to recovery which, generally, was based on blameworthiness in a moral sense. For reasons of social policy and because of the unusual nature of defendants’ acts, liability without fault continued to be prescribed in a certain restricted area, for example, upon keepers of wild animals, or those who handled explosives or other dangerous substances, or who engaged in ultrahazardous activities.</p>
<p id="66229c63-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">General dissatisfaction continued with the conceptual limitations which traditional tort and contract doctrines placed upon the consumers and users of manufactured products, this at a time when mass production of an almost infinite variety of goods and products was responding to a myriad of ever-changing societal demands stimulated by wide-spread commercial advertising. From an historic combination of economic and sociological forces was born the doctrine of strict liability in tort.</p>
<p id="66229c64-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We, ourselves, were perhaps the first court to give the new principle judicial sanction. In <i>Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc</i>., 377 P.2d 897 (Cal. 1963), [w]e rejected both contract and warranty theories, as the basis for liability. Strict liability, we said, did not rest on a consensual foundation but, rather, on one created by law. The liability was created judicially because of the economic and social need for the protection of consumers in an increasingly complex and mechanized society, and because of the limitations in the negligence and warranty remedies. Subsequently, the <i>Greenman</i> principle was incorporated in §402A of the Restatement Second of Torts, and adopted by a majority of American jurisdictions.</p>
<p id="66229c65-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From its inception, however, strict liability has never been, and is not now, <i>absolute</i> liability. As has been repeatedly expressed, under strict liability the manufacturer does not thereby become the insurer of the safety of the product’s user. On the contrary, the plaintiff’s injury must have been caused by a “defect” in the product. Thus the manufacturer is not deemed responsible when injury results from an unforeseeable use of its product. Furthermore, we have <span title="812" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-812">p. 812</span>recognized that though most forms of contributory negligence do not constitute a defense to a strict products liability action, plaintiff’s negligence is a complete defense when it comprises assumption of risk.</p>
<p id="66229c66-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Li v. Yellow Cab Co.</i>, 532 P.2d 1226 (Cal. 1975), we introduced the other doctrine with which we are concerned, comparative negligence. We examined the history of contributory negligence, the massive criticism directed at it because its presence in the slightest degree completely barred plaintiff’s recovery, and the increasing defection from the doctrine. [W]e announced in <i>Li</i> the adoption of a “pure” form of comparative negligence which, when present, reduced but did not prevent plaintiff’s recovery. We held that the defense of assumption of risk, insofar as it is no more than a variant of contributory negligence, was merged into the assessment of liability in proportion to fault.</p>
<p id="66229c67-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We stand now at the point of confluence of these two conceptual streams, having been greatly assisted by the thoughtful analysis of the parties and the valuable assistance of numerous amici curiae. We are by no means the first to consider the interaction of these two developing principles. As with the litigants before us, responsible and respected authorities have reached opposing conclusions stressing in various degrees the different considerations which we now examine.</p>
<p id="6622c378-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those counseling against the recognition of comparative fault principles in strict products liability cases vigorously stress, perhaps equally, not only the conceptual, but also the semantic difficulties incident to such a course. The task of merging the two concepts is said to be impossible, that “apples and oranges” cannot be compared, that “oil and water” do not mix, and that strict liability, which is not founded on negligence or fault, is inhospitable to comparative principles. The syllogism runs, contributory negligence was only a defense to negligence, comparative negligence only affects contributory negligence, therefore comparative negligence cannot be a defense to strict liability. While fully recognizing the theoretical and semantic distinctions between the twin principles of strict products liability and traditional negligence, we think they can be blended or accommodated.</p>
<p id="6622c379-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The inherent difficulty in the “apples and oranges” argument is its insistence on fixed and precise definitional treatment of legal concepts. In the evolving areas of both products liability and tort defenses, however, there has developed much conceptual overlapping and interweaving in order to attain substantial justice. The concept of strict liability itself, as we have noted, arose from dissatisfaction with the wooden formalisms of traditional tort and contract principles in order to protect the consumer of manufactured goods. Similarly, increasing social awareness of its harsh “all or nothing” consequences led us in <i>Li</i> to moderate the impact of traditional contributory negligence in order to accomplish a fairer and more balanced result. We acknowledged an intermixing of defenses of contributory negligence and assumption of risk and formally effected a type of merger: “We think it clear that the adoption of a system of comparative negligence should entail the merger of the defense of assumption of risk into the general scheme of assessment of liability in proportion to fault in <span title="813" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-813">p. 813</span>those particular cases in which the form of assumption of risk involved is no more than a variant of contributory negligence.”</p>
<p id="6622c37a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Furthermore, the “apples and oranges” argument may be conceptually suspect. We think, accordingly, the conclusion may fairly be drawn that the terms “comparative negligence,” “contributory negligence” and “assumption of risk” do not, standing alone, lend themselves to the exact measurements of a micrometer-caliper, or to such precise definition as to divert us from otherwise strong and consistent countervailing policy considerations. Fixed semantic consistency at this point is less important than the attainment of a just and equitable result. The interweaving of concept and terminology in this area suggests a judicial posture that is flexible rather than doctrinaire.</p>
<p id="6622c37b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The [goals sought to be achieved by strict products liability] will not be frustrated by the adoption of comparative principles. Plaintiffs will continue to be relieved of proving that the manufacturer or distributor was negligent in the production, design, or dissemination of the article in question. Defendant’s liability for injuries caused by a defective product remains strict. The principle of protecting the defenseless is likewise preserved, for plaintiff’s recovery will be reduced <i>only</i> to the extent that his own lack of reasonable care contributed to his injury. The cost of compensating the victim of a defective product, albeit proportionately reduced, remains on defendant manufacturer, and will, through him, be “spread among society.” However, we do not permit plaintiff’s own conduct relative to the product to escape unexamined, and as to that share of plaintiff’s damages which flows from his own fault we discern no reason of policy why it should, following <i>Li</i>, be borne by others. Such a result would directly contravene the principle announced in <i>Li</i>, that loss should be assessed equitably in proportion to fault.</p>
<p id="6622c37c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude, accordingly, that the expressed purposes which persuaded us in the first instance to adopt strict liability in California would not be thwarted were we to apply comparative principles. What would be forfeit is a degree of semantic symmetry. However, in this evolving area of tort law in which new remedies are judicially created, and old defenses judicially merged, impelled by strong considerations of equity and fairness we seek a larger synthesis. If a more just result follows from the expansion of comparative principles, we have no hesitancy in seeking it, mindful always that the fundamental and underlying purpose of <i>Li</i> was to promote the equitable allocation of loss among all parties legally responsible in proportion to their fault.</p>
<p id="6622c37d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In passing, we note one important and felicitious result if we apply comparative principles to strict products liability. This arises from the fact that under present law when plaintiff sues in negligence his own contributory negligence, however denominated, may diminish but cannot wholly defeat his recovery. When he sues in strict products liability, however, his “assumption of risk” <i>completely bars</i> his recovery. Under <i>Li</i>, as we have noted, “assumption of risk” is merged into comparative principles. The consequence is that after <i>Li</i> in a negligence action, plaintiff’s conduct which amounts to “negligent” assumption of risk no longer defeats plaintiff’s recovery. Identical conduct, however, in a <span title="814" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-814">p. 814</span>strict liability case acts as a complete bar under rules heretofore applicable. Thus, strict products liability, which was developed to free injured consumers from the constraints imposed by traditional negligence and warranty theories, places a consumer plaintiff in a worse position than would be the case were his claim founded on simple negligence. This, in turn, rewards adroit pleading and selection of theories. The application of comparative principles to strict liability obviates this bizarre anomaly by treating alike the defenses to both negligence and strict products liability actions. In each instance the defense, if established, will reduce but not bar plaintiff’s claim.</p>
<p id="6622c37e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We note that the majority of our sister states which have addressed the problem, either by statute or judicial decree, have extended comparative principles to strict products liability.</p>
<p id="6622c37f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having examined the principal objections and finding them not insurmountable, and persuaded by logic, justice, and fundamental fairness, we conclude that a system of comparative fault should be and it is hereby extended to actions founded on strict products liability. In such cases the separate defense of “assumption of risk,” to the extent that it is a form of contributory negligence, is abolished. While, as we have suggested, on the particular facts before us, the term “equitable apportionment of loss” is more accurately descriptive of the process, nonetheless, the term “comparative fault” has gained such wide acceptance by courts and in the literature that we adopt its use herein.</p>
<p id="6622c380-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The court ruled that the admission of evidence of the decedent’s intoxication and failure to use safety equipment was improper because it was not germane to showing any assumption of the risk or product misuse—the only blame-the-plaintiff defenses available at the time of trial. The court said the introduction of such evidence was instead a “thinly disguised” attempt to inject issues of general contributory negligence into the case—a defense not yet available as of the time of trial. The court believed it was this evidence that led to the jury’s defense verdict. This improper admission of evidence, therefore, necessitated a new trial. In the event of the new trial, such evidence could be offered but only as relevant to the issue of the decedent’s comparative fault under the newly applicable pure comparative fault system.]</p>

<p id="6622c383-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Apples and Oranges.</i></b> As illustrated by the two cases above, courts have disagreed over whether comparative fault principles should apply to strict products liability suits. The traditional rule, preserved by Ohio, is that contributory negligence is no defense to strict products liability, but secondary implied assumption of the risk and product misuse are complete defenses. One reason these courts refuse to apply contributory negligence to strict liability is because of the harsh consequences of its application. However, once most jurisdictions abandoned contributory negligence for comparative fault, the <span title="815" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-815">p. 815</span>pressure mounted to recognize this partial defense. In response, some courts continued to resist the argument for application of comparative fault due to the notion that the disparate concepts of “negligence” and “strict liability” are like apples and oranges and impossible to compare to one another. Of course, some scholars (and most courts) observe that even strict liability contains some notion of fault:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="6622c384-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">In the case of products liability, the fault inheres primarily in the nature of the product. The product is “bad” because it is not duly safe; it is determined to be defective and (in most jurisdictions) unreasonably dangerous. [S]imply maintaining the bad condition or placing the bad product on the market is enough for liability.…One does not have to stigmatize conduct as negligent in order to characterize it as fault.</p></div>
<p id="6622c385-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Wade, <i>Products Liability and Plaintiff’s Fault</i>, 29 Mercer L. Rev. 373, 377 (1978). Do you find the opinion of the Ohio court or the California court more persuasive?</p>
<p id="6622ea96-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Is Application of Comparative Fault Pro-Plaintiff?</i></b> As you read the Ohio Supreme Court’s decision adamantly refusing to apply comparative fault to strict liability, the impression given is that the court’s holding is designed to protect the ability of injured consumers to recover—by refusing to permit their misconduct to be used as even a partial defense. On the other hand, retaining the traditional rules also leaves intact the defense of secondary implied assumption of the risk as a <i>complete</i> defense. In the California decision, the court stressed that one advantage of applying comparative fault principles to strict products liability cases was that this permitted cases involving conduct amounting to a secondary implied assumption of the risk to no longer raise a total defense; instead, it would merely permit the jury to apportion any fault associated with such an assumption and to reduce the damage recovery accordingly. Thus, the decision whether to retain the traditional defense rules or to apply comparative fault principles is neither purely pro-consumer nor pro-seller. Which set of rules is better for a plaintiff is dependent upon the particular circumstances of the plaintiff’s case.</p>

<p id="6622ea99-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">In Justice Traynor’s concurring opinion in <i>Escola</i> advocating for the adoption of strict products liability, his final caveat was that the seller’s liability “should, of course, be defined in terms of the safety of the product in <i>normal and proper use</i>.” Similarly, in his majority opinion in <i>Greenman</i> adopting strict liability, he summarized the plaintiff’s burden of proof as follows: “To establish the <span title="816" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-816">p. 816</span>manufacturer’s liability it was sufficient that plaintiff proved that he was injured while using the [product] in a <i>way it was intended to be used</i> as a result of a defect in design and manufacture.” Seizing upon such language, courts have refused to hold product sellers liable for injuries associated with some misuses of products. On the other hand, as we have already seen in <i>Dawson</i>, where the court rejected the manufacturer’s argument that an automobile need not be crashworthy because crashing is not the intended purpose of a car, the misuse defense has its limits. A product “misuse” technically might entail any use of the product not intended by the manufacturer or seller. The <i>Daniell</i> case below involves a particularly notorious misuse of the allegedly defective product. Observe what role the plaintiff’s misconduct plays in the court’s analysis of whether a defect existed in the product. What is most instructive about this case is the court’s determination about what factor will determine whether a consumer’s misuse provides a complete defense to the strict liability claim. You will also observe that the defendant could potentially have used the consumer’s misuse to its legal advantage in two different ways. In the <i>Tokai</i> case that follows <i>Daniell</i>, the court considers how to correctly analyze a claim of a possible design defect when the product hurt an unintended, yet foreseeable, user.</p>

<p id="6622eaa0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This matter comes on for consideration of defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The court, having considered the accompanying memoranda submitted by the parties, the deposition and affidavits relied upon by the parties, and the relevant law, finds that the motion is well taken and should be granted. Summary judgment is a severe remedy that should be cautiously applied. It should not be used for resolution of factual issues appearing on the record. Summary judgment is appropriate in this case, however, because certain uncontroverted facts bar plaintiff’s recovery.</p>
<p id="6622eaa1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1980, the plaintiff became locked inside the trunk of a 1973 Ford LTD automobile, where she remained for some nine days. Plaintiff now seeks to recover for psychological and physical injuries arising from that occurrence. She contends that the automobile had a design defect in that the trunk lock or latch did not have an internal release or opening mechanism. She also maintains that the manufacturer is liable based on a failure to warn of this condition. Plaintiff advances several theories for recovery: (1) strict products liability under §402A of the Restatement 2d of Torts, (2) negligence, and (3) breach of express warranty and implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.</p>
<p id="6622eaa2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Three uncontroverted facts bar recovery under any of these theories. First, the plaintiff ended up in the trunk compartment of the automobile because she <span title="817" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-817">p. 817</span>felt “overburdened” and was attempting to commit suicide. Second, the purposes of an automobile trunk are to transport, stow and protect items from elements of the weather. Third, the plaintiff never considered the possibility of exit from the inside of the trunk when the automobile was purchased. Plaintiff has not set forth evidence indicating that these facts are controverted.</p>
<p id="6622eaa3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The overriding factor barring plaintiff’s recovery is that she intentionally sought to end her life by crawling into an automobile trunk from which she could not escape. This is not a case where a person inadvertently became trapped inside an automobile trunk. The plaintiff was aware of the natural and probable consequences of her perilous conduct. Not only that, the plaintiff, at least initially, sought those dreadful consequences. Plaintiff, not the manufacturer of the vehicle, is responsible for this unfortunate occurrence.</p>
<p id="6622eaa4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recovery under strict products liability and negligence will be discussed first because the concept of duty owed by the manufacturer to the consumer or user is the same under both theories in this case. As a general principle, a design defect is actionable only where the condition of the product is unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer. Under strict products liability or negligence, a manufacturer has a duty to consider only those risks of injury which are foreseeable. A risk is not foreseeable by a manufacturer where a product is used in a manner which could not reasonably be anticipated by the manufacturer and that use is the cause of the plaintiff’s injury. The plaintiff’s injury would not be foreseeable by the manufacturer.</p>
<p id="6622eaa5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The purposes of an automobile trunk are to transport, stow and secure the automobile spare tire, luggage and other goods and to protect those items from elements of the weather. The design features of an automobile trunk make it well near impossible that an adult intentionally would enter the trunk and close the lid. The dimensions of a trunk, the height of its sill and its load floor and the efforts to first lower the trunk lid and then to engage its latch, are among the design features which encourage closing and latching the trunk lid while standing outside the vehicle. The court holds that the plaintiff’s use of the trunk compartment as a means to attempt suicide was an unforeseeable use as a matter of law. Therefore, the manufacturer had no duty to design an internal release or opening mechanism that might have prevented this occurrence.</p>
<p id="662311b6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor did the manufacturer have a duty to warn the plaintiff of the danger of her conduct, given the plaintiff’s unforeseeable use of the product. Another reason why the manufacturer had no duty to warn the plaintiff of the risk inherent in crawling into an automobile trunk and closing the trunk lid is because such a risk is obvious. There is no duty to warn of known dangers in strict products liability or tort. Moreover, the potential efficacy of any warning, given the plaintiff’s use of the automobile trunk compartment for a deliberate suicide attempt, is questionable.</p>
<p id="662311b7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court notes that the automobile trunk was not defective under these circumstances. The automobile trunk was not unreasonably dangerous within the contemplation of the ordinary consumer or user of such a trunk when used <span title="818" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-818">p. 818</span>in the ordinary ways and for the ordinary purposes for which such a trunk is used. <i>Skyhook Corp. v. Jasper</i>, 90 N.M. 143, 147, 560 P.2d 934, 938 (1977); Restatement 2d of Torts §402A, comment i.</p>
<p id="662311b8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having held that the plaintiff’s conception of the manufacturer’s duty is in error, the court need not reach the issues of the effect of comparative negligence or other defenses such as assumption of the risk on the products liability claim. <i>See Scott v. Rizzo</i>, 634 P.2d 1234 at 1240-41 (N.M. 1981) (In adopting comparative negligence, the New Mexico Supreme Court indicated that in strict products liability a plaintiff’s “misconduct” would be a defense, but not a complete bar to recovery). The court also does not reach the comparative negligence defense on the negligence claim.</p>
<p id="662311b9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having considered the products liability and negligence claims, plaintiff’s contract claims for breach of warranty are now analyzed. Plaintiff has come forward with no evidence of any express warranty regarding exit from the inside of the trunk. [The implied warranty of merchantability claim also is flawed.] [T]he usual and ordinary purpose of an automobile trunk is to transport and store goods, including the automobile’s spare tire. Plaintiff’s use of the trunk was highly extraordinary, and there is no evidence that that trunk was not fit for the ordinary purpose for which it was intended.</p>
<p id="662311ba-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lastly, plaintiff’s claim for a breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, cannot withstand summary judgment because the plaintiff has admitted that, at the time she purchased the automobile neither she nor her husband gave any particular thought to the trunk mechanism. Plaintiff has admitted that she did not even think about getting out from inside of the trunk when purchasing the vehicle. Plaintiff did not rely on the seller’s skill or judgment to select or furnish an automobile suitable for the unfortunate purpose for which the plaintiff used it.</p>
<p id="662311bb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">IT IS ORDERED that defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment is granted.</p>

But in terms of whether the defendant had an obligation (or duty) to take the risks of being trapped in the trunk into consideration in designing the car, or in preparing instructions or warnings for its use, the key determination was whether the misuse was <i>foreseeable</i> or not. Given the characteristics of the car’s trunk and the rather bizarre nature of the plaintiff’s conduct, the court concludes as a matter of law that her misuse was unforeseeable. This conclusion alone was sufficient to permit the conclusion that no product defect existed. The duty to design or provide warnings does not encompass risks that arise only out of unforeseeable misuses of the product. Would this conclusion change if <span title="819" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-819">p. 819</span>the manufacturer of the vehicle starts receiving numerous reports of others attempting suicide in the same manner?</p>
<p id="662311bf-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Problems with Duty to Warn Claim</i>.</b> The unforeseeable misuse of the product meant that the defendant was under no duty to provide a warning for the product. The court also concludes that the danger of being locked inside the trunk would have been obvious. This conclusion would remove any duty to warn because of the <i>common knowledge doctrine</i>. As if those two fatal flaws were not enough, the court also observes that any warning about the danger of being locked in the trunk would have been ineffective in preventing this plaintiff’s harm since the plaintiff desired to kill herself. This is an example of the facts rebutting the read and heed presumption. Any one of these three rationales would have been sufficient to warrant the grant of the defendant’s motion for summary judgment on this claim.</p>
<p id="662311c0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Negligent Misuse</i>.</b> The court’s conclusion that the plaintiff’s misuse was unforeseeable ended the necessary analysis of the strict liability claims. The court stated, therefore, that it need not consider the possible negligence by the plaintiff in her misuse of the product. Like the majority of jurisdictions, New Mexico has applied comparative fault to strict liability claims (whether the misconduct relates to negligently assuming a known risk or involves some other general act of carelessness). Had the plaintiff’s misuse been foreseeable, the plaintiff might have still been able to prove a defect existed. This is true in automobile defect cases involving allegations that the car was not crashworthy. As we have already seen in that context, most courts hold that such foreseeable misuse does not relieve the sellers of potential liability for defects related to the car’s crashworthiness. But in such instances, if the plaintiff’s misuse involves any negligence on the plaintiff’s part, the misuse can give rise to demonstrating comparative fault which will serve at least as a partial defense by reducing the recoverable damages. Thus, the two questions any defendant must consider in cases of product misuse are (1) was the misuse foreseeable to the seller, and if so, (2) did the plaintiff’s misuse involve negligence?</p>

<p id="662338db-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has certified to us the following question:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="662338dc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Under the Texas Products Liability Act of 1993 [Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ch. 82] can the legal representative of a minor child injured as a result of the misuse of a product by another minor child maintain a defective-design products liability claim against the product’s manufacturer where the product was intended to be used only by adults, the risk that children might misuse the product was obvious to the product’s manufacturer and to its intended users, and a safer alternative design was available?</p></div>
<p id="662338dd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the context of this case, the question, more specifically, is whether a disposable butane lighter, intended only for adult use, can be found to be defectively designed if it does not have a child-resistant mechanism that would have prevented or substantially reduced the risk of injury from a child’s foreseeable misuse of the lighter.</p>
<p id="662338de-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The factual circumstances in which the certified question comes to us are these.</p>
<p id="662338df-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rita Emeterio bought disposable butane lighters for use at her bar. Her daughter, Gloria Hernandez, took lighters from the bar from time to time for her personal use. Emeterio and Hernandez both knew that it was dangerous for children to play with lighters. They also knew that some lighters were made with child-resistant mechanisms, but Emeterio chose not to buy them. On April 4, 1995, Hernandez’s five-year-old daughter, Daphne, took a lighter from her mother’s purse on the top shelf of a closet in a bedroom in her grandparents’ home and started a fire in the room that severely burned her two-year-old brother, Ruben.</p>
<p id="662338e0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hernandez, on Ruben’s behalf, sued the manufacturers and distributors of the lighter, Tokai Corporation and Scripto-Tokai Corporation (collectively, “Tokai”), in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, San Antonio Division. Hernandez alleged that the lighter was defectively designed and unreasonably dangerous because it did not have a child-resistant safety mechanism that would have prevented or substantially reduced the likelihood that a child could have used it to start a fire. Tokai does not dispute that mechanisms for making disposable lighters child-resistant were available when the lighter Daphne used was designed and marketed, or that such mechanisms can be incorporated into lighters at nominal cost.</p>
<p id="662338e1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Tokai moved for summary judgment on the grounds that a disposable lighter is a simple household tool intended for adult use only, and a manufacturer has no duty to incorporate child-resistant features into a lighter’s design to protect unintended users—children—from obvious and inherent dangers. <span title="821" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-821">p. 821</span>Tokai also noted that adequate warnings against access by children were provided with its lighters, even though that danger was obvious and commonly known. In response to Tokai’s motion, Hernandez argued that, because an alternative design existed at the time the lighter at issue was manufactured and distributed that would have made the lighter safer in the hands of children, it remained for the jury to decide whether the lighter was defective under Texas’ common-law risk-utility test.</p>
<p id="662338e2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The federal district court granted summary judgment for Tokai, and Hernandez appealed.</p>
<p id="662338e3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A product’s utility and risk under the common-law test must both be measured with reference to the product’s intended users. A product intended for adults need not be designed to be safe for children solely because it is possible for the product to come into a child’s hands.</p>
<p id="662338e4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A child may hurt himself or others with a hammer, a knife, an electrical appliance, a power tool, or a ladder; he may fall into a pool, or start a car. The manufacturers and sellers of such products need not make them childproof merely because it is possible for children to cause harm with them and certain that some children will do so. The risk that adults, for whose use the products were intended, will allow children access to them, resulting in harm, must be balanced against the products’ utility to their intended users.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1105B_a3959580-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1105B_a3959580-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d">23</a></span></p>
<p id="66235ff6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if an alternative design does not [overly] restrict a product’s utility…it still may not be sufficient for defective-design liability if it overly restricts consumer choice. The <i>Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability</i> offers [an example]: a smaller car that is not as crashworthy as a larger car merely because it is not as large. A chemistry set designed for the ordinary teenager is not unreasonably dangerous solely because it is possible that a younger sibling could get into it and harm himself or others. Products liability law does not force experienced carpenters to use only nail guns that are safe for the garage workshop. To make such products safe for the least apt, and unintended, user would hold other users hostage to the lowest common denominator.</p>
<p id="66235ff7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A disposable lighter without a child-resistant mechanism is safe as long as its use is restricted to adults, as its manufacturer and users intend. Tokai makes lighters with and without child-resistant devices. Adults who want to minimize the possibility that their lighter may be misused by a child may purchase the child-resistant models. Adults who prefer the other model, as Hernandez and Emeterio did, may purchase it [though such products have since been banned by the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission]. Whether adult users of lighters should [have been] deprived of this choice of product design because of the risk that some children will obtain lighters that are not child-resistant and cause harm is the proper focus of the common-law risk-utility test.</p>
<span title="822" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-822">p. 822</span>
<p id="66235ff8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The utility of disposable lighters must be measured with reference to the intended adult users. Consumer preference—that is, that users like Hernandez and Emeterio simply prefer lighters without child-resistant features—is one consideration. Tokai also argues that adults whose dexterity is impaired, such as by age or disease, cannot operate child-resistant lighters, but Hernandez disputes this. If Tokai were shown to be correct, then that would be an additional consideration in assessing the utility of non-child-resistant lighters.</p>
<p id="66235ff9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The relevant risk includes consideration of both the likelihood that adults will allow children access to lighters and the gravity of the resulting harm. The risk is not that a child who plays with a lighter may harm himself. We assume that that risk is substantial. As Hernandez and Emeterio both acknowledged in this case, they would not allow a child to have a lighter and would discipline a child caught playing with one. Rather, the risk is that a lighter will come into a child’s hands. The record before us suggests that children will almost certainly obtain access to lighters, that this will not happen often in comparison with the number of lighters sold, but that when it does happen the harm caused can be extreme. Each of these considerations is relevant in assessing the risk of non-child-resistant lighters.</p>
<p id="66235ffa-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, a manufacturer’s intention that its product be used only by adults does not insulate it from liability for harm caused by a child who gains access to the product, but liability standards must be applied in the context of the intended users.</p>
<p id="66235ffb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center ">□ □ □</p>
<p id="66235ffc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether in the present case the issue is one of fact or law is not for us to decide. The Fifth Circuit has asked whether a defective-design claim can be maintained under stated conditions. We respond that it can, depending on the evidence, but there will also be cases—the present case may or may not be one—in which a claim cannot be maintained as a matter of law, for the reasons we have explained.</p>
<p id="66235ffd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A few other arguments remain to be addressed.</p>
<p id="66235ffe-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Tokai contends that a defective-design claim cannot be maintained in the circumstances before us because a manufacturer has no duty whatsoever to make products intended solely for adults child-proof. As we have explained, a product that is safely designed for its intended users is not unreasonably dangerous solely because someone else may obtain the product. But we think the issue should be resolved by applying the standard risk-utility analysis rather than as a matter of legal policy, at least in the circumstances of this case.</p>
<p id="66235fff-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Tokai also contends that simple tools, like hammers and knives, whose essential utility involves intrinsic and obvious dangers to children, should not, as a matter of law, be unreasonably dangerous. [W]e do not think [this suggested approach is] helpful. The obviousness of the risk of harm and the inherent nature of the danger are, as we have explained, important factors to <span title="823" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-823">p. 823</span>be considered in determining whether a product is unreasonably dangerous, and in a given case they may be conclusive of that issue. But that depends on an assessment of all the relevant considerations in the risk-utility analysis, not on whether a product can be called a simple tool. Many simple tools are not defectively designed merely because they are not child-proof, but the reason is because they are not unreasonably dangerous under the risk-utility test, not because they are simple tools.</p>
<p id="66236000-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Tokai argues that the risk-utility analysis is ill-suited for cases like this when the utility of a product design is largely satisfaction of consumer preference and the risk of harm, while improbable relative to the number of products sold, is often calamitous. We recognize that such circumstances make the use of the risk-utility test difficult. But we are reluctant to carve out exceptions to the risk-utility test that we have employed for years and that has been adopted by the <i>Restatement</i>, especially when consumer expectation is a factor to be considered in applying the risk-utility test and may in some cases outweigh all other considerations. We believe that the risk-utility test, properly focused, can be applied in a case like this.</p>
<p id="66236001-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Tokai argues that the weight of authority in other jurisdictions is to reject disposable lighter design-defect claims as a matter of law. This is true, but there is more to it. Courts in jurisdictions that employ a consumer-expectation test for determining defect have mostly held that disposable lighters without childproof features are not defectively designed because they function in the manner expected by the intended adult consumers. But courts in jurisdictions employing a risk-utility analysis have mostly concluded that the determinative considerations are usually matters for the jury.</p>
<p id="66236002-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum: a claimant can maintain a defective-design claim in the circumstances posited by the certified question if, but only if, with reference to the product’s intended users, the design defect makes the product unreasonably dangerous, a “safer alternative design” as defined by statute is available, and the defect is the producing cause of the injury.</p>

<p id="66238715-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Foreseeable but Unintended Users and Uses.</i></b> The <i>Tokai</i> case involves the misuse (playing with a lighter) of a product by one not intended to be using the product. But as with the <i>Daniell</i> case, whether or not such unintended use creates an automatic defense to liability depends on whether this misuse is unforeseeable. The Texas Supreme Court was unwilling to say that a child getting hold of a lighter is unforeseeable. In fact, the manufacturer concedes as much with its own observation that the danger of access by children to lighters is “obvious and commonly known.” Given this concession, it is difficult for the court to rule as a matter of law that a manufacturer of such lighters need not take into account the risk of injury to a child.</p>
<span title="824" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-824">p. 824</span>
<p id="66238716-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>A Refined Application of the Risk Utility Test</i>.</b> The court in <i>Tokai</i> is careful to differentiate how the court (or factfinder) should apply the risk utility test in the circumstance of a foreseeable but unintended user of the product. It states that the risk utility test should be applied with reference to the intended adult users with the caveat that the product might end up in the hands of a child. If the court had instead indicated that the test should be applied with reference solely to child users, do you see why the risk utility test would obviously declare the lack of childproof features to be defective? Given the proper focus, why is the question of a defective design here much closer?</p>
<p id="66238717-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Risk Utility vs. Consumer Expectation Test</i>.</b> Near the end of the opinion, the court explains that most of the cases ruling in favor of lighter manufacturers in this factual circumstance come from states that employ the alternative consumer expectation test. Why under that test is the product’s design not defective? Although as a general rule, plaintiff’s lawyers often prefer the consumer expectation test (due to its simplicity and the lower cost of proving a defect since experts may not be necessary), this case illustrates that there are exceptions to this generalization. Which test might be more likely to lead to the conclusion that a design defect exists ultimately depends upon the facts of the particular case and the identity of the product involved?</p>
<p id="66238718-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Problem</i>.</b> An unlicensed 14-year-old obtains the key to the family sedan and goes joy riding on the interstate at 90 m.p.h. Due to vibrations in the steering mechanism, he loses control of the car and is injured. What role will the child’s inappropriate use of the car play in determining whether the car was defectively designed to handle being driven at such speeds?</p>

<div class="epub-feature epub-feature3 ">
<div class="epub-feature-heading2 cc-font-medium epub-text-left"><p id="6623871a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-left">Upon Further Review</p></div>
<p id="6623871b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Even when a product is well-built according to the original plans, sellers may face liability either because the design rendered the product unreasonably dangerous or because the product was unsafe absent some appropriate warnings regarding its safe use. Analysis of design defects is either done using the warranty-like consumer expectation test or the negligence-like risk-utility test, depending upon jurisdiction and the circumstances. Marketing defect claims are analyzed in a manner closest to negligence analysis—some would argue identically to negligence analysis. Even the language used by courts in marketing defects cases—<i>duty, breach, constructive or actual knowledge, reasonably adequate</i>—all allude to negligence-based concepts.</p>
<p id="6623871c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In terms of affirmative defenses, general forms of negligence were not permitted to be used at all at common law in a strict liability case. The only silver-bullet defenses were related to the consumer’s misuse of the <span title="825" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-825">p. 825</span>product or secondary implied assumption of the risk. The shift away from contributory negligence to forms of comparative fault has convinced many jurisdictions to now permit the plaintiff’s negligence to be a partial defense—something to be apportioned with the tortfeasors’ conduct and which will at least reduce the claimant’s recovery. Some courts are adamant in refusing to permit any ordinary negligence to constitute a defense, however. In most jurisdictions that permit comparative fault as a defense, they require the factfinder to apportion as merely another type of fault any conduct amounting to an unreasonable secondary implied assumption of the risk or unreasonable misuse. Of course, unforeseeable misuses of the product need not be taken into account when designing a product or providing warnings about the risks associated with its foreseeable uses.</p>

<p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="66218b6f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b">Unavoidably unsafe products. There are some products which, in the present state of human knowledge, are quite incapable of being made safe for their intended and ordinary use.…Such a product, properly prepared, and accompanied by proper directions and warning, is not defective, nor is it unreasonably dangerous.…The seller of such products, again with the qualification that they are properly prepared and marketed, and proper warning is given, where the situation calls for it, is not to be held to strict liability for unfortunate consequences attending their use, merely because he has undertaken to supply the public with an apparently useful and desirable product, attended with a known but apparently reasonable risk.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="6621d9bc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10C1B_a3959580-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d" id="note-N10C1B_a3959580-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d">3</a></span>&nbsp;As we have stated, whether the risks associated with a product are common knowledge is one factor courts consider when determining the existence of a duty to warn. Common knowledge is referred to as a defense, <i>see Seagram</i>, 814 S.W.2d at 388 n.5, because the product user has the burden to prove that the seller had a duty warn of a product’s danger, while the product seller may assert that no such duty existed because of the common knowledge regarding such danger.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="66224e29-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10DF0_a3959580-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d" id="note-N10DF0_a3959580-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d">3</a></span>&nbsp;Here, we discuss only the language of Comment <i>n</i>, which does not mention the defense consisting of a plaintiff’s misuse of a product in an unforeseeable manner. In some sense, such misuse is an act of contributory negligence. Nonetheless, it remains a defense to a products liability action based upon strict liability in tort.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="66235ff5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN1105B_a3959580-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d" id="note-N1105B_a3959580-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d">23</a></span>&nbsp;“Texas law does not require a manufacturer to destroy the utility of his product in order to make it safe.” <i>Hagans v.

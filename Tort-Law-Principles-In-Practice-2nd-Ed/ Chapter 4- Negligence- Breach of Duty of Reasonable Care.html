<p id="65b0a11f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">The tort of negligence is undoubtedly the most important, and most pervasive, tort cause of action today. Unlike most other tort claims that tend to be self-limiting to certain particular circumstances (e.g., battery claims generally involve someone getting hit by another on purpose), the tort of negligence has great flexibility—it can be, and is, applied to an infinite variety of differing factual circumstances. Examples of negligence claims include the motor vehicle accident when a car runs a red light; the skier who hits an object left on the slope; the house that burns after the furnace is poorly repaired; the doctor who forgets about a disastrous drug interaction; the radiologist who misses the tumor; and the hunter who fails to notice another hunter in the woods. These examples barely begin to scratch the surface of an area of the law whose potential application is only limited by one’s imagination.</p>
<p id="65b0a120-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The only thing common in each of these instances may be the fact that the injuries were not caused on purpose. They were all accidents rather than intentional torts. Tort law evolved long ago to provide a cause of action for these accidental scenarios. While not all accidents create negligence liability, if the court finds the defendant to be at fault, the defendant can be ordered to pay the plaintiff’s damages legally caused by the negligent conduct. A claim for negligence involves four easily stated elements: <i>Duty, Breach, Cause,</i> and <i>Damage</i>. This chapter will focus upon the duty and breach elements. Chapter 5 will consider the element of causation in a tort case. These seemingly <span title="158" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-158">p. 158</span>straightforward elements have been the grist for thousands upon thousands of judicial opinions in which courts have grappled with the conceptual and legal wrinkles involved in applying this cause of action to particular circumstances in a way that promotes just results, while providing clear enough rules so that citizens and litigants can modify and plan their behavior. We begin in this chapter with a look at what is meant by the duty of reasonable care.</p>

<p id="65b0a123-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Fundamental to negligence analysis is understanding and applying the duty of reasonable care. This model for finding fault in an accidental tort case is so ingrained in common law tort jurisprudence that it is often assumed that no other alternatives were ever possible. The following classic English case presented the court with the opportunity to choose different standards for application in a case of alleged negligence. As you read it, consider the arguments of the defendant as to why his proposed standard should be utilized instead of the one chosen by the trial court. Would there be anything wrong with picking the defendant’s model?</p>

Defendant was an adjacent property owner who built a hayrick on his own property. The hayrick caught fire on its own and spread across the property lines causing the plaintiff’s damages. Plaintiff alleged in his suit that the defendant had been negligent in the manner in which he built the hayrick, <span title="159" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-159">p. 159</span>and that this permitted the hayrick to catch on fire. At trial, the jury was instructed by the court that the defendant owed a duty to act as a prudent man would have acted under the circumstances. The jury found in the plaintiff’s favor, but the defendant obtained a new trial order from the trial court arguing that the court had used the wrong standard. The defendant had urged that the jury was instead to have been instructed to consider the defendant’s possible negligence judged not by the standard of ordinary prudence, but with reference to whether the defendant had acted bona fide to the best of his judgment. If he had, he was not responsible for the plaintiff’s damages just because he did not possess the “highest order of intelligence.” Upon review of the trial court’s order granting the new trial request, the Court of Common Pleas stated as follows:]</p>
<p id="65b0c83c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is contended that the question ought to have been whether the defendant had acted honestly and bona fide to the best of his own judgment. That, however, would leave so vague a line as to afford no rule at all, the degree of judgment belonging to each individual being infinitely various; and though it has been urged that the care which a prudent man would take is not an intelligible proposition as a rule of law, yet such has always been the rule adopted in cases of bailment. The care taken by a prudent man has always been the rule laid down; and as to the supposed difficulty of applying it, a jury has always been able to say, whether, taking that rule as their guide, there has been negligence on the occasion in question.</p>
<p id="65b0c83d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Instead, therefore, of saying that the liability for negligence should be co-extensive with the judgment of each individual, which would be as variable as the length of the foot of each individual, we ought rather to adhere to the rule which requires in all cases a regard to caution such as a man of ordinary prudence would observe. That was in substance the criterion presented to the jury in this case, and therefore the present rule must be discharged.</p>

The reasonable man is a fictitious person, who is never negligent, and whose conduct is always up to standard. He is not to be identified with the members of the jury, individually or collectively. It is therefore error to instruct the jury that the conduct of a reasonable man is to be determined by what they would themselves have done.</p></div>

<p id="65b0ef5d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Defendant agreed to ship a 329-pound crate for an individual from New York City to San Francisco for a fee, in the ordinary course of defendant’s business. Upon arrival in San Francisco, as the crate was being moved to the wharf defendant discovered that it appeared to be leaking some fluid. The fluid had the appearance of sweet oil. An adjacent box had stains on its outside and defendant believed it too was leaking its contents due to the damage. Defendant’s standard business practice was to take any damaged crates into a nearby building for inspection of the contents. Both the crate and the box were, therefore, taken inside for this purpose. Defendants’ agents, in the presence of other persons, took a mallet and chisel to the crate and began to open it. In the process of doing so, the contents of the crate exploded killing all present, and causing significant damage to that building as well as other nearby buildings occupied by defendant. It was later determined that the crate contained <span title="161" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-161">p. 161</span>nitroglycerine. The other box contained silverware. In 1866 the properties and dangers of nitroglycerine were not well known or understood. Although the substance was discovered 20 years earlier, few experiments had been conducted with it and those were confined to certain laboratories. Merely eight days before the accident involved in this case, another steamer travelling from Hamburg exploded while carrying the same substance, though news of this had not yet reached San Francisco. These two accidents attracted the attention of scientists to the subject and led to more careful investigation and experiments regarding the substance and to greater industrial uses for it. On plaintiff’s claim for negligence, the trial court held that defendant had no tort liability for the accident and plaintiff sought review.]</p>
<p id="65b0ef5e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Justice F<span class="epub-small-caps">IELD</span>: It appears from the record that the court finds, that neither the defendants, nor any of their employees…who had anything to do with the case of nitroglycerine, knew the contents of the case, or had any means of such knowledge, or had any reason to suspect its dangerous character, and that they did not know anything about nitroglycerine, or that it was dangerous. And it also appears that the court finds, that there was no negligence on the part of the defendants in receiving the case, or in their failure to ascertain the dangerous character of the contents; and in view of the condition of their knowledge, of the want of means of knowledge, and the absence of any reasonable ground of suspicion, that there was no negligence in the handling of the case at the time of the explosion.</p>
<p id="65b0ef5f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question presented to us is, whether upon this state of facts the plaintiff is entitled to recover for the injuries caused by the explosion to his buildings, outside of that portion occupied by the defendants under their lease.</p>
<p id="65b0ef60-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To fasten a further liability on the defendants, and hold them for injuries to that portion of the buildings not covered by their lease, it was contended in the court below, and it is urged here, that, as matter of law, they were chargeable with notice of the character and properties of the merchandise in their possession, and of the proper mode of handling and dealing with it, and were consequently guilty of negligence in receiving, introducing, and handling the box containing the nitroglycerine.</p>
<p id="65b11671-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If express carriers are thus chargeable with notice of the contents of packages carried by them, they must have the right to refuse to receive packages offered for carriage without knowledge of their contents. It would, in that case, be unreasonable to require them to accept, as conclusive in every instance, the information given by the owner. They must be at liberty, whenever in doubt, to require, for their satisfaction, an inspection even of the contents as a condition of carrying the packages. This doctrine would be attended in practice with great inconvenience, and would seldom lead to any good. Fortunately the law is not so unreasonable. It does not exact any such knowledge on the part of the carrier, nor permit him, in cases free from suspicion, to require information as to the contents of the packages offered as a condition of carrying them.</p>
<span title="162" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-162">p. 162</span>
<p id="65b11672-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Cases cited from other courts] recognize the right of the carrier to refuse to receive packages offered without being made acquainted with their contents, when there is good ground for believing that they contain anything of a dangerous character. It is only when such ground exists, arising from the appearance of the package or other circumstances tending to excite his suspicions, that the carrier is authorized, in the absence of any special legislation on the subject, to require a knowledge of the contents of the packages offered as a condition of receiving them for carriage.</p>
<p id="65b11673-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It not, then, being his duty to know the contents of any package offered to him for carriage, when there are no attendant circumstances awakening his suspicions as to their character, there can be no presumption of law that he had such knowledge in any particular case of that kind, and he cannot accordingly be charged as matter of law with notice of the properties and character of packages thus received. The first proposition of the plaintiff, therefore, falls, and the second, which depends upon the first, goes with it.</p>
<p id="65b11674-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendants, being innocently ignorant of the contents of the case, received in the regular course of their business, were not guilty of negligence in introducing it into their place of business and handling it in the same manner as other packages of similar outward appearance were usually handled. “Negligence” has been defined to be “the omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided by those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do, or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do.” It must be determined in all cases by reference to the situation and knowledge of the parties and all the attendant circumstances. What would be extreme care under one condition of knowledge, and one state of circumstances, would be gross negligence with different knowledge and in changed circumstances. The law is reasonable in its judgments in this respect. It does not charge culpable negligence upon any one who takes the usual precautions against accident, which careful and prudent men are accustomed to take under similar circumstances.</p>
<p id="65b11675-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he gist of the action is the negligence of the defendants: unless that be established, they are not liable. The mere fact that injury has been caused is not sufficient to hold them. No one is responsible for injuries resulting from unavoidable accident, whilst engaged in a lawful business. A party charging negligence as a ground of action must prove it. He must show that the defendant, by his act or by his omission, has violated some duty incumbent upon him, which has caused the injury complained of.</p>
<p id="65b11676-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here no such proof was made, and the case stands as one of unavoidable accident, for the consequences of which the defendants are not responsible.

<p id="65b11677-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This principle is recognized and affirmed in a great variety of cases—in cases where fire originating in one man’s building has extended to and destroyed the property of others; in cases where injuries have been caused by fire ignited by sparks from steamboats or locomotives, or caused by horses <span title="163" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-163">p. 163</span>running away, or by blasting rocks, and in numerous other cases which will readily occur to every one. The rule deducible from them is, that the measure of care against accident, which one must take to avoid responsibility, is that which a person of ordinary prudence and caution would use if his own interests were to be affected, and the whole risk were his own.</p>

<p id="65b13d98-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">The standard of the <i>reasonable person under the circumstances</i> has proven to be a very flexible standard, useful in many different contexts for determining whether an actor in question (typically the defendant, but sometimes a plaintiff too) is at fault for an accidental injury. But how does this reasonable person act under different sorts of recurring circumstances? Is reasonable care the same under emergencies as in other instances? When an activity involves a greater degree of inherent danger, does the reasonable person act the same? And what about actors that have different types of character traits? Does the reasonable person have ordinary knowledge, intelligence, and experience even if the defendant does not? Is the reasonable person sometimes blind, disabled, or mentally infirm if the actor we are judging has such a condition? The following cases answer these questions. Consider as you read these cases to what extent the answers to these questions are intellectually cohesive and consistent.</p>

<p id="65b164b2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case arose when Larry B. Cervelli [plaintiff] filed a personal injury suit for injuries he sustained when a pickup truck driven by him collided with a cement truck owned by DeBernardi Brothers, Inc. [and driven by its employee, Kenneth H. Graves, both defendants]. After trial, a jury found no negligence on the part of [defendants]. [Plaintiff] argues the jury was incorrectly instructed and, as a result, found as it did thereby prejudicing him. He raises the following issues on appeal: Did the court err in instructing the jury that it was not to consider a person’s skills in determining whether that person is negligent?</p>
<p id="65b164b3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We will reverse and remand.</p>
<p id="65b164b4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Around 7:30 a.m., February 22, 1980, a collision occurred approximately nine miles west of Rock Springs, Wyoming in the westbound lane of Interstate <span title="165" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-165">p. 165</span>Highway 80 involving a pickup driven by [plaintiff] and [defendant’s] cement truck. At the time of the accident, the road was icy and very slick; witnesses described it as covered with “black ice.” Just prior to the accident [plaintiff] had difficulty controlling his vehicle and began to “fishtail” on the ice. He eventually lost control of his vehicle and started to slide. Graves, who had been approaching appellant from behind at a speed of 35-40 m.p.h., attempted to pass appellant’s swerving vehicle first on the left side, then the right. He too, thereafter, lost control of his cement truck and the two vehicles collided. It was from that accident that [plaintiff] brought suit to recover damages for the numerous injuries he suffered.</p>
<p id="65b164b5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By his own admission, Graves at the time of the accident was an experienced, professional truck driver with over ten years of truck driving experience. He possessed a class “A” driver’s license which entitled him to drive most types of vehicles including heavy trucks. He had attended the Wyoming Highway Patrol’s defensive driver course and had kept up-to-date with various driving safety literature. He was the senior driver employed by DeBernardi Brothers, Inc.</p>
<p id="65b164b6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The suit was tried to a jury on the issues of [defendant’s] negligence as well as the degree, if any, of [plaintiff’s] own negligence. After a four-day trial, the jury was instructed and received the case for their consideration. They found no negligence on the part of [defendants]. Judgment was entered on the jury verdict and [plaintiff] moved for a new trial claiming the jury was improperly instructed. The district court took no action on the motion; it was deemed denied in sixty days. This appeal followed.</p>
<p id="65b18bc7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Plaintiff] calls our attention to and alleges as error [that] the district court…instructed the jury that:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65b18bc8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Negligence is the lack of ordinary care. It is the failure of a person to do something a reasonable, careful person would do, or the act of a person in doing something a reasonable, careful person would not do, under circumstances the same or similar to those shown by the evidence. The law does not say how a reasonable, careful person would act under those circumstances, as that is for the Jury to decide.</p>
<p id="65b18bc9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A reasonable, careful person, whose conduct is set up as a standard, is not the extraordinarily cautious person, nor the exceptionally skillful one, but rather a person of reasonable and ordinary prudence.</p></div>

[Plaintiff’s] counsel…argued the jury is at least allowed to take cognizance of any knowledge and skill he possesses; therefore, the instruction’s second paragraph should be deleted.</p>
<p id="65b18bcb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree.</p>
<p id="65b18bcc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That language is an apparent attempt to enlarge upon the reasonable man standard. In that attempt to explain the reasonable man concept, however, the instruction goes too far.

Simply put, the first paragraph of the instruction correctly states that negligence is the failure to exercise ordinary care where ordinary care is that degree of care which a reasonable person is expected to exercise under the same or similar circumstances. The trial court’s instruction first allows the jury to consider the parties’ acts as compared to how the reasonable person would act in similar circumstances and then limits the circumstances the jury can consider by taking out of their purview the circumstances of exceptional skill or knowledge which are a part of the totality of circumstances.</p>

<p id="65b18bcf-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">The reasonable person, who is the central focus in negligence analysis, actually permeates tort law. Examples we have already seen of the employment of the reasonable person have included:</p>

<p id="65b18bd5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our view that negligence should be determined in view of the circumstances is in accord with the general view. The <i>Restatement, Torts 2d §283</i> (1965) defines the standard of conduct in negligence actions in terms of the reasonable man under like circumstances. Professor Prosser, discussing the reasonable man, likewise said that “negligence is a failure to do what the reasonable man would do ‘under the same or similar circumstances.’” He contended a jury must be instructed to take the circumstances into account. Prosser, Law of Torts §32, p. 151 (4th ed. 1971). Prosser also went on to note that under the latitude of the phrase “under the same or similar circumstances,” courts have made allowance not only for external facts but for many of the characteristics of the actor himself.</p>
<p id="65b18bd6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At a minimum, as Justice Holmes once said, the reasonable man is required to know what every person in the community knows. Holmes, Common Law p. 57 (1881). In a similar vein, Professor Prosser notes there is, at least, a minimum standard of knowledge attributable to the reasonable man based upon what is common to the community. Prosser, supra at pp. 159-160. Prosser went on to say, however, that although the reasonable man standard provides a minimum standard below which an individual’s conduct will not be permitted to fall, the existence of knowledge, skill, or even intelligence superior to that of an ordinary man will demand conduct consistent therewith. Along that same line, <i>Restatement, Torts 2d §289</i> (1965) provides:</p>

<p id="65b18bd7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The actor is required to recognize that his conduct involves a risk of causing an invasion of another’s interest if a reasonable man would do so while exercising</p>

<p id="65b1b2ea-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Section 289 comment m</i> expands further on the effect of superior qualities of an individual when it states:</p>

Superior qualities of actor.</i> The standard of the reasonable man requires only a minimum of attention, perception, memory, knowledge, intelligence, and judgment in order to recognize the existence of the risk. If the actor has in fact more than the minimum of these qualities, he is required to exercise the superior qualities that he has in a manner reasonable under the circumstances. The standard becomes, in other words, that of a reasonable man with such superior attributes.</p></div>
</div>
<p id="65b1b2ec-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The instruction given by the trial court could easily have been construed by the jury to preclude their consideration of exceptional skill or knowledge on the part of either party which the evidence may have shown. In determining negligence the jury must be allowed to consider all of the circumstances surrounding an occurrence, including the characteristics of the actors in reaching their decision. Where, as here, there was evidence from which the jury could have concluded appellee Graves was more skillful than others as a result of his experience as a driver, they should be allowed to consider that as one of the circumstances in reaching their decision. The second paragraph of [the challenged instruction], as [plaintiff] points out, could easily have misled the jury into disregarding what they may have found from the evidence regarding [defendant’s] skill and as such prejudiced appellant. The objectionable language of the instruction is surplus language which, rather than clarifying the fictional concept of the reasonable person, actually unduly limited it. Therefore, because [this] instruction was both an incorrect statement of the law and more importantly very probably misleading, we hold that the trial court committed reversible error in using it to instruct the jury.</p>

We have just explored differing rules regarding how <i>below</i> versus <i>above</i> average intelligence is considered. One potential argument against considering the actor’s physical attributes (or disability) is that this trends toward a variable standard of care dependent upon the actor in question. The more such idiosyncratic variables factor into the analysis, the greater the shift is toward a subjective standard. On the other hand, is it reasonable to assume that a blind person will act the same as someone without a vision disability?</p>

<p id="65b1d906-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This action for personal injuries was brought by William J. Poyner, who is legally blind, after he fell from an elevated walkway. The trial judge granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, concluding that Mr. Poyner was contributorily negligent as a matter of law. On appeal, Mr. Poyner contends that, in light of his handicap, a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether he exercised reasonable care, and that the entry of summary judgment was therefore erroneous. We affirm.</p>
<p id="65b1d907-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The essential evidentiary facts are undisputed. Mr. Poyner suffers from glaucoma and retrobulbar neuritis. He testified that he is able to see approximately six to eight feet in front of him. Notwithstanding his handicap, Mr. Poyner does not use a cane or a seeing eye dog in pursuing his daily activities.</p>
<p id="65b1d908-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On August 24, 1993, Mr. Poyner was proceeding from his home to Parklane Cleaners, a dry cleaning establishment located on the west side of the 4300 block of Connecticut Avenue, N.W. in Washington, D.C. The entrance to Parklane Cleaners is adjacent to an inclined platform which is located approximately four feet above street level. Mr. Poyner testified that he had walked by the area on three or four previous occasions, and that he was aware of the general layout. He stated that there were bushes along the edge of the platform, and that these bushes provided a natural barrier which would prevent him from falling if he attempted to walk too far. On the day of the accident, however, and unbeknownst to Mr. Poyner, one of the bushes was missing, and there was thus nothing to restrain him from falling off the platform.</p>
<p id="65b1d909-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Poyner testified that as he was walking along the elevated area, he heard someone call “Billy!” from Connecticut Avenue. He turned his head to the right, but continued to walk forward to the location at the end of the platform where he thought that a bush would be. There was no bush, however, and Mr. Poyner fell, suffering personal injuries.</p>
<p id="65b1d90a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Poyner brought suit against several defendants, including the owners of the building, the property manager in charge of its maintenance, and the proprietor of Parklane Cleaners. After the parties had conducted discovery, the defendants moved for summary judgment, contending, <i>inter alia</i>, that Mr. Poyner had been contributorily negligent as a matter of law. The trial judge granted the motion, and she stated her reasons, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65b1d90b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here we have a plaintiff who is partially visually impaired, legally blind, who can see some in front of him and gets about without the assistance of any mechanical or other disability aids.</p>
<p id="65b1d90c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">He was aware, as he was approaching this area to enter the cleaners, that he was on an elevated surface. He was not paying full attention, having been distracted <span title="169" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-169">p. 169</span>by a call from someone out in the street. And according to the plaintiff’s own testimony at his deposition, [he] continued to proceed forward and went over the edge into the lower—falling from the part where the bushes were, into the lower stairwell, and sustained injuries.</p>
<p id="65b1d90d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Poyner’s actions, in the court’s judgment, clearly violate an objective reasonableness standard…. No reasonable jurors could conclude that the plaintiff was not negligent when he continued to walk on an elevated surface with limited vision while his head was turned away from the direction of his travel in an area in which he was not very familiar.</p></div>
<p id="65b1d90e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ordinarily, questions of negligence and contributory negligence must be decided by the trier of fact. A party asserting the defense of contributory negligence is required to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the plaintiff failed to exercise reasonable care. “Only in the exceptional case is evidence so clear and unambiguous that contributory negligence should be found as a matter of law.” <i>Tilghman v. Johnson</i>, 513 A.2d 1350, 1351 (D.C. 1986) (citations omitted).</p>
<p id="65b1d90f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial judge concluded that this was one of those rare cases in which contributory negligence—a defense with respect to which the defendants had the burden of proof—had been established as a matter of law. We agree. Indeed, we are satisfied, as was the trial judge, that Mr. Poyner’s own testimony established that he did not exercise reasonable care and that his own contributory negligence proximately caused the accident.</p>
<p id="65b1d910-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is undisputed that, at the time of the accident, a shrub at the end of the elevated platform was missing. A photograph which is a part of the record demonstrates that this was readily apparent, at least to any sighted person who chose to look. “[A] person must see what is reasonably there to be seen.” <i>Jackson v. Schenick</i>, 174 A.2d 353, 355 (D.C. 1961) (citation omitted). In this case, Mr. Poyner acknowledged that his attention was distracted when someone called his name, and that he turned his head to the right, but continued to walk forward. At the critical moment, according to his own testimony, Mr. Poyner, who could see six to eight feet in front of him and was aware of his handicap, did not look where he was going.</p>
<p id="65b20021-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Poyner argues, however, that he is not a sighted person, and that “it is reasonable <i>for a legally blind person</i>…as a response to his name being called, [to] turn towards the direction of his caller, reach for the handle and continue his step towards the door.” (Emphasis added.) He claims that those actions “do not constitute contributory negligence.” He contends, in other words, that on account of his visual impairment, his conduct should be tested against a different standard of care.</p>

The precedents in other jurisdictions, however, support affirmance of the trial court’s order. “It seems to be the general rule that a blind or otherwise handicapped person, in using the public ways, must exercise for his own safety due care, or care commensurate with the known or reasonably foreseeable dangers.

<p id="65b20025-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Smith v. Sneller</i>, 26 A.2d 452 (Pa. 1942), the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania considered a situation similar to the one before us, and its disposition is instructive. Sneller, a plumbing contractor, had removed a portion of the sidewalk and had dug a trench in order to make a sewer connection. On the north side of the trench, Sneller constructed a barricade. On the south side, however, Sneller simply left a pile of earth two feet high. The plaintiff, Smith, was walking north along the sidewalk towards the trench. As a result of defective eyesight, he failed to see the pile of earth. Mr. Smith fell into the trench, and sustained personal injuries. A jury returned a verdict in his favor.</p>
<p id="65b20026-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The intermediate appellate court expressed sympathy for Mr. Smith “in his effort to make a living in spite of his physical handicap,” but nevertheless felt constrained to reverse the decision and enter judgment n.o.v. in Sneller’s favor. Smith appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which affirmed the judgment. Noting that Mr. Smith’s vision was so defective that he could not see a dangerous condition immediately in front of him, and that the accident could have been avoided if he had used “one of the common well-known compensatory devices for the blind, such as a cane, a ‘seeing eye’ dog, or a companion,” the court concluded:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65b20027-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff’s conduct was not equal to the degree of care required of him. The Superior Court very properly said: “A blind man may not rely wholly upon his other senses to warn him of danger but must use the devices usually employed, to compensate for his blindness. Only by so doing can he go about with comparative safety to himself.” We are in accord with that learned court, that plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law, and we must, therefore, affirm the judgment.</p></div>
<p id="65b20028-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">26 A.2d at 454.</p>
<p id="65b20029-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The reasoning of the court in <i>Smith</i> applies equally to the present case. Here, as in <i>Smith</i>, the plaintiff was walking alone, and he did not use a guide dog or a cane. As a result, he fell from the walkway. Indeed, the evidence of contributory negligence is stronger here than in <i>Smith</i>, for Mr. Poyner, who could see six to eight feet in front of him, acknowledged that, at the moment that he fell, he was not looking where he was going.</p>

<p id="65b2002a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Coker v. McDonald’s Corp.</i>, 537 A.2d 549 (Del. Super. 1987), the legally blind plaintiff was walking to the entrance of a McDonald’s restaurant from the parking lot. Unlike the plaintiffs in <i>Smith</i> and in the present case, however, she was carrying a cane in her right hand, and she was holding on to a companion with her left hand. Ms. Coker lost her balance while attempting to navigate around an obstruction, and she sustained injuries. The defendant claimed that the obstruction was “open and obvious,” and that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent as a matter of law. The court disagreed:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65b2002b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A blind person is not bound to discover <i>everything</i> which a person of normal vision would. He is bound to use due care under the circumstances. Due care for a blind person includes a reasonable effort to compensate for his unfortunate affliction by use of artificial aids for discovery of obstacles in his path. When an effort in this direction is made, it will ordinarily be a jury question whether or not such effort was a reasonable one.</p></div>
<p id="65b2273c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Id.</i> at 550-51 (emphasis in original) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Characterizing the issue presented as being whether Ms. Coker acted reasonably under the circumstances, the court concluded that “where the blind plaintiff is not using any aid,…as in <i>Smith v. Sneller, supra</i>, a court could rule as a matter of law that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent.” <i>Id.</i> at 551. Because Ms. Coker was using two different aids, however—the cane and the companion—the question of contributory negligence was for the jury, and the defendant was not entitled to summary judgment. <i>Id</i>.</p>
<p id="65b2273d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree with the analysis of the courts both in <i>Smith v. Sneller</i> and in <i>Coker</i>. Like the plaintiff in <i>Smith</i>, but unlike the plaintiff in <i>Coker</i>, Mr. Poyner was alone, and he used neither a cane nor a seeing eye dog. He also looked away at the critical moment. Under these circumstances, he was contributorily negligent as a matter of law, and summary judgment was properly granted.</p>

Yet as we will see below, courts have long held that mental impairment is not an excuse for conduct that would otherwise be considered careless. Interestingly, the original philosophical impetus for the rule—that those with mental impairment should be institutionalized—has fallen into disfavor. Yet the rule remains the same. Consider whether the modern justification for this old rule is sufficiently compelling. Notwithstanding its acceptance of this rule of law, the court below nevertheless finds in favor of the defendant for reasons more fundamental than our definition of reasonable care—it ultimately concludes that the actor owed no duty of care whatsoever.</p>

We hold that adults with mental disabilities have the same general duty of care toward others as those without. But we conclude that the relationship between the parties and public policy considerations here are such that Rusk had no such duty to Creasy.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="65b24e58-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b"><i>Background</i></p></div>
<p id="65b24e59-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In July, 1992, Lloyd Rusk’s wife admitted Rusk to the Brethren Healthcare Center (“BHC”) because he suffered from memory loss and confusion and Rusk’s wife was unable to care for him. Rusk’s primary diagnosis was Alzheimer’s disease. Over the course of three years at BHC, Rusk experienced periods of anxiousness, confusion, depression, disorientation, and agitation. Rusk often resisted when staff members attempted to remove him from prohibited areas of the facility. On several occasions, Rusk was belligerent with both staff and other residents. In particular, Rusk was often combative, agitated, and aggressive and would hit staff members when they tried to care for him.</p>
<p id="65b24e5a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">BHC had employed Creasy as a certified nursing assistant for nearly 20 months when the incident at issue occurred. Creasy’s responsibilities included caring for Rusk and other patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Residents with Alzheimer’s had bruised Creasy during the course of her work for BHC, and Creasy knew that Rusk had Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p id="65b24e5b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On May 16, 1995, Creasy and another certified nursing assistant, Linda Davis, were working through their routine of putting Rusk and other residents to bed. Creasy knew that Rusk had been “very agitated and combative that evening.” By Creasy’s account:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65b24e5c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Davis] was helping me put Mr. Rusk to bed. She was holding his wrists to keep him from hitting us and I was trying to get his legs to put him to bed. He was hitting and kicking wildly. During this time, he kicked me several times in my left knee and hip area. My lower back popped and I yelled out with pain from my lower back and left knee.</p></div>
<p id="65b24e5d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Creasy filed a civil negligence suit against Rusk, seeking monetary damages for the injuries she suffered as a result of Rusk’s conduct. Rusk moved for summary judgment and the trial court granted his motion. Creasy appealed. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding “that a person’s mental capacity, whether that person is a child or an adult, must be factored [into] the determination of whether a legal duty exists,” and that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to the level of Rusk’s mental capacity.</p>

<p id="65b24e5e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case requires us to decide two distinct questions of Indiana common law:</p>
<p id="65b24e5f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(1) Whether the general duty of care imposed upon adults with mental disabilities is the same as that for adults without mental disabilities?</p>
<p id="65b24e60-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(2) Whether the circumstances of Rusk’s case are such that the general duty of care imposed upon adults with mental disabilities should be imposed upon him?</p>
<p id="65b24e61-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In many, if not most, jurisdictions, the general duty of care imposed on adults with mental disabilities is the same as that for adults without mental disabilities. <i>See Restatement (Second) of Torts §283B</i> (1965). Adults with mental disabilities are held to the same standard of care as that of a reasonable person under the same circumstances without regard to the alleged tortfeasor’s capacity to control or understand the consequences of his or her actions.</p>
<p id="65b24e62-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Judge Kirsch, writing for the Court of Appeals in this case, found that Indiana law does not follow the Restatement rule. The Court of Appeals held “that a person’s mental capacity, whether that person is a child or an adult, must be factored [into] the determination of whether a legal duty exists.” <i>Creasy v. Rusk</i>, 696 N.E.2d 442, 446 (Ind. Ct. App. 1998<i>)</i>. We believe that the Court of Appeals accurately stated Indiana law but that the law is in need of revision.</p>
<p id="65b24e63-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he generally accepted rule in jurisdictions other than Indiana is that mental disability does not excuse a person from liability for “conduct which does not conform to the standard of a reasonable man under like circumstances.” <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts §283B</i>; <i>accord</i> Restatement (Third) of Torts §9(c) (Discussion Draft Apr. 5, 1999) (“Unless the actor is a child, the actor’s mental or emotional disability is not considered in determining whether conduct is negligent.”). People with mental disabilities are commonly held liable for their intentional and negligent torts. No allowance is made for lack of intelligence, ignorance, excitability, or proneness to accident.</p>
<p id="65b27574-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The public policy reasons most often cited for holding individuals with mental disabilities to a standard of reasonable care in negligence claims include the following.</p>
<p id="65b27575-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(1) Allocates losses between two innocent parties to the one who caused or occasioned the loss.</p>
<p id="65b27576-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(2) Provides incentive to those responsible for people with disabilities and interested in their estates to prevent harm and “restrain” those who are potentially dangerous.</p>
<p id="65b27577-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(3) Removes inducements for alleged tortfeasors to fake a mental disability in order to escape liability. The Restatement mentions the ease with which mental disability can be feigned as one possible basis for this policy concern.</p>
<p id="65b27578-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(4) Avoids administrative problems involved in courts and juries attempting to identify and assess the significance of an actor’s disability.</p>
<p id="65b27579-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(5) Forces persons with disabilities to pay for the damage they do if they [are to live in the world.]. The Restatement adds that it is better that the assets, if any, of the one with the mental deficiency be used “to compensate innocent victims than that [the assets] remain in their hands.”</p>
<span title="174" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-174">p. 174</span>
<p id="65b2757a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To assist in deciding whether Indiana should adopt the generally accepted rule, we turn to an examination of contemporary public policy in Indiana as embodied in enactments of our state legislature.</p>
<p id="65b2757b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since the 1970’s, Indiana law has strongly reflected policies to deinstitutionalize people with disabilities and integrate them into the least restrictive environment. National policy changes have led the way for some of Indiana’s enactments in that several federal acts either guarantee the civil rights of people with disabilities or condition state aid upon state compliance with desegregation and integrationist practices.</p>
<p id="65b2757c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These legislative developments reflect policies consistent with those supporting the Restatement rule generally accepted outside Indiana in that they reflect a determination that people with disabilities should be treated in the same way as non-disabled persons.</p>
<p id="65b2757d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We pause for a moment to consider in greater detail…that the Restatement rule may very well have been grounded in a policy determination that persons with mental disabilities should be institutionalized or otherwise confined rather than “live in the world.” It is clear from our recitation of state and federal legislative and regulatory developments that contemporary public policy has rejected institutionalization and confinement for a “strong professional consensus in favor of…community treatment…and integration into the least restrictive…environment.” We observe that it is a matter of some irony that public policies favoring the opposite ends—institutionalization and confinement on the one hand and community treatment and integration into the least restrictive environment on the other—should nevertheless yield the same common law rule: that the general duty of care imposed on adults with mental disabilities is the same as that for adults without mental disabilities.</p>
<p id="65b2757e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In balancing the considerations presented in the foregoing analysis, we reject the Court of Appeals’ approach and adopt the Restatement rule. We hold that a person with mental disabilities is generally held to the same standard of care as that of a reasonable person under the same circumstances without regard to the alleged tortfeasor’s capacity to control or understand the consequences of his or her actions.</p>
<p id="65b2757f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We turn now to the question of whether the circumstances of Rusk’s case are such that the general duty of care imposed upon adults with mental disabilities should be found to run from him to Creasy.</p>
<p id="65b27580-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In asking this question, we recognize that exceptions to the general rule will arise where the factual circumstances negate the factors supporting imposition of a duty particularly with respect to the nature of the parties’ relationship and public policy considerations.</p>
<p id="65b27581-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We find that the relationship between Rusk and Creasy and public policy concerns dictate that Rusk owed no duty of care to Creasy. <i>See Webb v. Jarvis</i>, 575 N.E.2d 992, 995 (Ind. 1991) (balancing three factors to determine whether an individual owes a duty to another: (1) the relationship between the parties; (2) the reasonable foreseeability of harm to the person injured; and (3) public policy concerns).</p>
<span title="175" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-175">p. 175</span>
<p id="65b27582-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unlike the typical victim supporting the Restatement rationale, Creasy was not a member of the public at large, unable to anticipate or safeguard against the harm she encountered. Creasy knew of Rusk’s violent history. She could have changed her course of action or requested additional assistance when she recognized Rusk’s state of mind on the evening when she received the alleged injury. Rusk’s inability to comprehend the circumstances of his relationship with Creasy and others was the very reason Creasy was employed to support Rusk. The nursing home and Creasy, through the nursing home, were “employed to encounter, and knowingly did encounter, just the dangers which injured” Creasy. <i>Anicet</i>, 580 So. 2d at 276.</p>
<p id="65b29c93-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second Restatement policy rationale creates an inducement for those responsible for a person with a mental disability to prevent harm to others. By placing Rusk in a nursing home, we presume Rusk’s wife made a difficult decision based on her desire to prevent Rusk from being violent and harming himself, herself, or others. Mrs. Rusk entrusted her husband’s care, including prevention of the harm he might bring to others, to the nursing home staff and the nursing home. And as a business enterprise, the nursing home received compensation for its services.</p>
<p id="65b29c94-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With respect to the third policy rationale, “it is virtually impossible to imagine circumstances under which a person would feign the symptoms of mental disability and subject themselves to commitment to an institution in order to avoid some future civil liability.” To the extent that such circumstances exist, there is no evidence whatsoever that they are present under the facts in this case.</p>
<p id="65b29c95-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, there are no administrative difficulties in this case with respect to determining the degree and existence of Rusk’s mental disability. Under the relationship analysis set forth above and the present policy analysis, it is unnecessary to determine the degree of Rusk’s mental disability. We need only conclude that Rusk had a mental disability which served as the reason for his presence in the nursing home and the foundation of his relationship with Creasy.</p>
<p id="65b29c96-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree with Judge Friedlander…that there was no material question of fact as to the existence, let alone the advanced stage, of Rusk’s Alzheimer’s disease and his inability to appreciate or control his violent behavior. Rusk was admitted to the nursing home because he was confused and suffering from memory loss such that his wife could not care for him. By May 1995, when Creasy was injured by Rusk, Rusk had been a resident of the nursing home for three years and his condition had deteriorated. He regularly displayed behaviors characteristic of a person with advanced Alzheimer’s disease such as aggression, belligerence, and violence.</p>
<p id="65b29c97-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to the public policy concerns behind the Restatement rule, we find that it would be contrary to public policy to hold Rusk to a duty to Creasy when it would place “too great a burden on him because his disorientation and potential for violence is the very reason he was institutionalized and needed the aid of employed caretakers.”</p>
<p id="65b29c98-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rusk was entitled to summary judgment because public policy and the nature of the relationship between Rusk, Creasy, and the nursing home preclude <span title="176" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-176">p. 176</span>holding that Rusk owed a duty of care to Creasy under these factual circumstances.</p>

The court rejected this because, among other things, it would adopt a standard infinitely variable with each case. But isn’t this also the result of the decision by courts, such as in <i>Cervelli</i>, to hold gifted and talented actors to a higher standard of care? In other words, if the reasonable person does not take on inferior knowledge and skills, why does the reasonable person take on superior knowledge and skills? Consider tort law’s purpose of deterring accidents. How might this purpose be fulfilled with the dichotomy courts have adopted?</p>
<p id="65b29c9c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Physical Disabilities vs. Mental Disabilities.</i></b> While it is often true that there is a physical explanation for or cause of many mental disabilities, the mental versus physical dichotomy courts recognize focuses upon the manifestation of the disability itself in applying the rules. Thus, while a traumatic brain injury is certainly a physical problem, the actor’s mental disability caused by the physical condition will be considered a mental disability for purposes of applying negligence rules. Can the decisions by the majority of courts, as demonstrated in <i>Poyner</i> and <i>Creasy</i>, to treat physical and mental disabilities differently in negligence cases be reconciled? What differences exist between such disabilities that would justify having the reasonable person take on the physical disabilities, but not the mental ones? With consideration for the Restatement’s five justifications for not considering mental disability (discussed in <i>Creasy</i>), which of these would point toward a different rule for physical disabilities?</p>

In the unit on <i>battery</i> we encountered an elderly patient at a nursing home with mental deficits. In that case, the court was asked whether the law of Colorado required the plaintiff to prove merely that the defendant had intended contact, or whether the defendant had also intended for the contact to be harmful or offensive—the single v. dual intent debate. The court there ruled in favor of the dual intent requirement, and affirmed the jury’s fact determination that the particular defendant sued did not appreciate that her slapping the plaintiff was an offensive contact. But the court also said there was no special rule for the mentally infirm—just that such persons were less likely to meet the dual intent requirement. In <i>Creasy</i>, the court rules first that the mentally infirm will have the same standard applied to them in a negligence claim as a person of sound mind (i.e., that the reasonable person was of sound <span title="177" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-177">p. 177</span>mind).

When a court needs to determine the reasonableness of a child’s conduct, however, it is clear that the law follows the expectations of the citizenry. Most people unschooled in the law would find it monstrous to hold a child to the same expectations for care as an adult. Tort law follows this school of thought by creating a <i>child standard of care</i> for use in analyzing children’s conduct in many scenarios. But this standard does not apply to any and all conduct by children.</p>

Menlove</i>, 132 Eng. Rep. 490 (1837).</p>
<p id="65b2ead7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Exceptions to the reasonable person standard developed when the individual whose conduct was alleged to have been negligent suffered from some physical impairment, such as blindness, deafness, or lameness. Courts also found it necessary, as a practical matter, to depart considerably from the objective standard when dealing with children’s behavior. Children are traditionally encouraged to pursue childhood activities without the same burdens and responsibilities with which adults must contend. <i>See</i> Bahr, <i>Tort Law and the Games Kids Play</i>, 23 S.D.L. Rev. 275 (1978). As a result, courts evolved a special standard of care to measure a child’s negligence in a particular situation.</p>

In the past we have always compared a child’s conduct to that expected of a reasonably careful child of the same age, intelligence, maturity, training and experience. This case is the first to consider the question of a child’s liability for injuries sustained as a result of his or her operation of a motorized vehicle or participation in an inherently dangerous activity.</p>
<span title="179" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-179">p. 179</span>
<p id="65b311ea-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts in other jurisdictions have created an exception to the special child standard because of the apparent injustice that would occur if a child who caused injury while engaged in certain dangerous activities were permitted to defend himself by saying that other children similarly situated would not have exercised a degree of care higher than his, and he is, therefore, not liable for his tort. Some courts have couched the exception in terms of children engaging in an activity which is normally one for adults only. <i>See, e.g., Dellwo v. Pearson</i>, 259 Minn. 452, 107 N.W.2d 859, 97 A.L.R.2d 866 (1961) (operation of a motorboat). We believe a better rationale is that when the activity a child engages in is inherently dangerous, as is the operation of powerful mechanized vehicles, the child should be held to an adult standard of care.</p>
<p id="65b311eb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Such a rule protects the need of children to be children but at the same time discourages immature individuals from engaging in inherently dangerous activities. Children will still be free to enjoy traditional childhood activities without being held to an adult standard of care. Although accidents sometimes occur as the result of such activities, they are not activities generally considered capable of resulting in “grave danger to others and to the minor himself if the care used in the course of the activity drops below that care which the reasonable and prudent adult would use…” <i>Daniels v. Evans</i>, 107 N.H. 407, 408, 224 A.2d 63 (1966).</p>
<p id="65b311ec-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other courts adopting the adult standard of care for children engaged in adult activities have emphasized the hazards to the public if the rule is otherwise. We agree with the Minnesota Supreme Court’s language in its decision in <i>Dellwo v. Pearson</i>, supra at 457-58:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65b311ed-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Certainly in the circumstances of modern life, where vehicles moved by powerful motors are readily available and frequently operated by immature individuals, we should be skeptical of a rule that would allow motor vehicles to be operated to the hazard of the public with less than the normal minimum degree of care and competence.</p></div>
<p id="65b311ee-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Dellwo</i> applied the adult standard to a 12-year-old defendant operating a motorboat. Other jurisdictions have applied the adult standard to minors engaged in analogous activities. <i>Goodfellow v. Coggburn</i>, 560 P.2d 873 (1977) (minor operating tractor); <i>Williams v. Esaw</i>, 522 P.2d 950 (1974) (minor operating motorcycle); <i>Perricone v. DiBartolo</i>, 302 N.E.2d 637 (1973) (minor operating gasoline-powered minibike); <i>Krahn v. LaMeres</i>, 483 P.2d 522, 525-26 (Wyo. 1971) (minor operating automobile). The holding of minors to an adult standard of care when they operate motorized vehicles is gaining approval from an increasing number of courts and commentators.</p>
<p id="65b311ef-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The operation of a snowmobile likewise requires adult care and competence. Currently 2.2 million snowmobiles are in operation in the United States.

When the injury occurred, petitioner was operating a 30-horsepower snowmobile at speeds of 10 to 20 miles per hour. The record indicates that the machine itself was capable of 65 miles per hour.

If the child standard is typically applied to children in order to avoid “monstrous” results, why do courts revert back to the adult standard for certain dangerous activities? What does this say about the law’s regard for the importance of allowing children to participate in such conduct (by encouraging it)?</p>
<p id="65b33905-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Objective vs. Subjective.</i></b> To the extent that the child standard takes so many of the child-actor’s own traits into consideration, what is left of the objective standard? Is the child standard a repudiation of the <i>Vaughan</i> decision to employ an objective standard for negligence analysis? Are we simply asking if the child acted in a bona fide manner? Even under the child standard of care, there is one attribute that is held inviolate—the trait of reasonableness. While the child standard of care takes on many of the particular traits of the actor—age, intelligence, and experience—the reasonably prudent child always remains careful under the circumstances. The age, intelligence, and experience may impact the perceptions of danger but, once perceived, the reasonably prudent child still makes prudent decisions.</p>

<p id="65b38742-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are instructing you that gasoline due to its inflammability is a very dangerous substance if not properly handled.…With an appreciation of such danger, and under conditions where its existence reasonably should have been known, there follows a high degree of care which circumscribes the conduct of everyone about the danger, and whether the parties…acted as reasonable men under the circumstances is for you the jury to decide.</p></div>
<p id="65b38743-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court denied this point of charge finding that it was “cumulative with respect to the standard charge given by the Court.…” In this appeal, Stewart argues that the trial court erred in failing to read point of charge No. 4 to the jury because Pennsylvania law applies an “extraordinary” or “heightened duty of care” to those employing a dangerous agency.</p>
<p id="65b38744-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We begin our discussion by reaffirming the principle that there is but one standard of care to be applied to negligence actions involving dangerous <span title="183" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-183">p. 183</span>instrumentalities in this Commonwealth.

<p id="65b38746-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Restatement (Second) of Torts §298 comment b</i> (1965).</p>
<p id="65b38747-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Properly read, our cases involving dangerous agencies reaffirm these well accepted principles found in the Restatement. In <i>Konchar v. Cebular</i>, 3 A.2d 913 (Pa. 1939),…the plaintiff drove into a gas station and ordered a gallon of gasoline. The defendant began pumping gas into the motorcycle, but when three-quarters of a gallon was placed in the tank, the gasoline overflowed and ran into the hot cylinders of the engine. The plaintiff, sitting on the motorcycle, was burned when the gasoline exploded.…In deciding the case, this Court noted that gasoline was a dangerous substance requiring a “high duty of care.” <i>Konchar</i>, 3 A.2d at 914. We affirmed, holding that, “it was for the jury to decide whether, under all of the circumstances, [the plaintiff] had acted as a reasonably prudent man.” <i>Id</i>. Thus, we recognized that the question of the plaintiff’s contributory negligence was to be determined using the reasonable care standard in light of the particular circumstances of the case. One such circumstance, we acknowledged, was that gasoline, a dangerous substance, was involved requiring that the reasonably prudent person exercise a higher degree of care under these circumstances. Taken in context, our statement that the plaintiff was under a “high duty of care” did nothing more than reaffirm the general principle that the care employed by a reasonable man must be proportionate to the danger of the activity.</p>
<p id="65b38748-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Admittedly, this notion of a heightened level of “extraordinary care” for the handling of dangerous agencies has crept into our jurisprudence. In <i>Kuhns v. Brugger</i>, 135 A.2d 395 (Pa. 1957), this Court considered the proper standard of care for negligence involving a handgun. The defendant in this case was a grandfather who had left a loaded handgun in an unlocked dresser drawer. While alone in the house, his grandchild found the gun and inadvertently shot another child. [W]e found that the possession of a loaded handgun placed upon the defendant the duty of, “exercising not simply ordinary, but extraordinary care so that no harm might be visited upon others.” This language in <i>Kuhns</i> on its face unfortunately suggests that this Commonwealth recognizes a separate standard of care, “extraordinary care,” for dangerous instrumentalities above and beyond “ordinary care.” We reject this suggestion.</p>
<p id="65b38749-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he <i>Kuhns</i> Court did not create a standard of “extraordinary care” for all dangerous instrumentalities as advocated by the appellant. Instead, we believe that the <i>Kuhns</i> Court considered the danger of an unattended handgun under the circumstances of this case and fashioned a standard of care proportionate to that danger.</p>

<p id="65b3ae5a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In summation, this Commonwealth recognizes only one standard of care in negligence actions involving dangerous instrumentalities—the standard of reasonable care under the circumstances. It is well established by our case law that the reasonable man must exercise care in proportion to the danger involved in his act. <i>See MacDougall</i>, 166 A. at 592 (“Vigilance must always be commensurate with danger. A high degree of danger always calls for a high degree of care”).</p>
<p id="65b3ae5b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With these principles in mind we must next examine the jury instructions in this case. Reviewing the charge as a whole, we cannot conclude that it was inadequate. The trial judge explained to the jury that negligence is “the absence of ordinary care which a reasonably prudent person would exercise in the circumstances here presented.” The trial judge further explained:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65b3ae5c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is for you to determine how a reasonably prudent person would act in those circumstances. Ordinary care is the care a reasonably prudent person would use under the circumstances presented in this case. It is the duty of every person to use ordinary care not only for his own safety and the protection of his property, but also to avoid serious injury to others. What constitutes ordinary care varies according to the particular circumstances and conditions existing then and there. The amount of care required by law must be in keeping with the degree of danger involved.</p></div>

<p id="65b3ae5e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We find that this charge, when read as a whole, adequately instructed the jury. The charge informed the jury that the proper standard of care was “reasonable” or “ordinary” care under the circumstances in accordance with the law of this Commonwealth. The charge properly instructed the jury that the level of care required changed with the circumstances. The charge also informed the jury that the level of care required increased proportionately with the level of danger in the activity. We find nothing in this charge that is confusing, misleading, or unclear. From these instructions, the jury had the tools to examine the circumstances of the case and determine that the defendant was required to exercise a “higher degree of care” in using the dangerous agency of gasoline.</p>

However, many courts have traditionally felt it appropriate to enhance the normal reasonable care jury instruction in cases where the actor faced a sudden emergency. The <i>sudden emergency</i> instruction highlights for the jury the circumstance in which an actor has decreased time for attention and deliberation when facing an emergency not of his own making. Whether this truism necessitates additional jury instructions is a matter hotly debated by courts today, with mixed results.</p>

<p id="65b3d581-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In November 1990, Elmo Knutson was driving north on 43rd Avenue near Bell Road in Phoenix when Theresa Magnusson entered 43rd Avenue from a shopping center driveway and headed south in Knutson’s lane. Seeing Magnusson’s car in his lane, Knutson accelerated and swerved left, avoiding what he perceived to be an impending head-on collision. In doing this, he crossed the double yellow line into oncoming traffic and collided with Bruce Myhaver’s pickup. Magnusson continued south not realizing she was involved. A police officer who saw the accident stopped her a short distance away and asked her to return to the scene.</p>
<p id="65b3d582-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Myhaver was seriously injured as a result of the collision and brought a damage action against both Knutson and Magnusson. Magnusson settled and was named as a non-party at fault, and the Myhavers proceeded to trial against Knutson.</p>
<p id="65b3d583-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At trial, [the] judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65b3d584-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In determining whether a person acted with reasonable care under the circumstances, you may consider whether such conduct was affected by an emergency. An “emergency” is defined as a sudden and unexpected encounter with a danger which is either real or reasonably seems to be real. If a person, without negligence on his or her part, encountered such an emergency and acted reasonably to avoid harm to self or others, you may find that the person was not negligent. This is so even though, in hindsight, you find that under normal conditions some other or better course of conduct could and should have been followed.</p></div>
<p id="65b3fc95-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The jury found Knutson not liable. On appeal, the Myhavers argued that the sudden emergency doctrine [embodied in the above instruction] should be abandoned. Alternatively, they urged that the trial judge erred in giving the instruction under the facts of the case and that it constituted an impermissible comment on the evidence….</p>

[A] few jurisdictions have abolished sudden emergency instructions, either generally or just in automobile accident cases, while others have discouraged their use, sometimes placing specific restrictions on which cases are appropriate for their use.

<p id="65b3fc9b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although criticizing the instruction and holding that it need not be given, other states leave it to the judge’s discretion. Massachusetts has held that a judge may instruct the jury that emergency conditions “are a factor in determining” whether a party acted with reasonable care. A number of states have carefully analyzed the issue and concluded that the instruction should not be routinely given in every claim of emergency. By definition, most accidents involve an emergency. These courts have concluded that the instruction should be discouraged because of the factors already mentioned, though it may be given, in the judge’s discretion, in the few cases presenting true, unanticipated emergencies.</p>
<p id="65b3fc9c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of the more careful analyses of the subject was made in <i>McKee v. Evans</i>, 551 A.2d 260 (Pa. Super. 1988). The Pennsylvania court found that the instruction had been improperly given in favor of a driver involved in a ten-mile pursuit. The court concluded that the instruction was not favored and should be given only in those cases in which evidence showed that (1) the party seeking the instruction had not been negligent prior to the emergency, (2) the emergency had come about suddenly and without warning, and (3) reaction to the emergency was spontaneous, without time for reflection. While these factors are certainly not all inclusive, we believe they help describe the situations to which the instruction should be confined.</p>
<p id="65b3fc9d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having noted that the instruction is but a factor to be considered in determining reasonable care, is subsumed within the general concept of negligence, is a matter of argument rather than a principle of law and can single out and unduly emphasize one factor and thus mislead a jury, we join those courts that have discouraged use of the instruction and urge our trial judges to give it only in the rare case. The instruction should be confined to the case in which the emergency is not of the routine sort produced by the impending accident but arises from events the driver could not be expected to anticipate.</p>
<p id="65b3fc9e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not, however, join those courts that absolutely forbid use of the instruction. There are cases in which the instruction may be useful or may help to explain the need to consider a sudden emergency and the consequent reflexive actions of a party when determining reasonable care. We believe, however, that in those few cases in which the instruction is given, it would <span title="188" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-188">p. 188</span>be important to explain that the existence of a sudden emergency and reaction to it are only some of the factors to be considered in determining what is reasonable conduct under the circumstances. Even though a judge may exercise his discretion and give a sudden emergency instruction in a particular case, it will rarely, if ever, be error to refuse to give it.</p>
<p id="65b3fc9f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying these principles to the case at bench, we conclude that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in giving the instruction. This is a case in which there was no evidence of antecedent negligence by Knutson, in whose favor the instruction was given. In light of the testimony of the various witnesses, there was no question about the existence of an emergency. Knutson was faced with a situation not ordinarily to be anticipated and one of imminent peril when Magnusson pulled out of the shopping center and suddenly turned toward him in the wrong lane of traffic. Finally, Knutson’s reaction—swerving across the center line into the path of Myhaver’s oncoming vehicle—was probably both reflexive in nature and the type of conduct that absent a sudden emergency would almost automatically be found as negligence, if not negligence per se. Given these facts, the real and only issue was whether Knutson’s conduct was reasonable under the circumstances of the emergency. We believe, therefore, the trial judge had discretion to instruct on the sudden emergency as a factor in the determination of negligence.</p>

Other courts believe it should never be given because it is simply unnecessary. At best then, the instruction might be viewed as a luxury option for the actor whose conduct under an emergency is being analyzed under the traditional reasonable person analysis. The good advocate should be armed with plenty of persuasive arguments for a finding of reasonableness, depending on the actual circumstances. When the actor is facing a possible significant injury to himself, and his ability to perceive the potential danger of his conduct is lessened, the actor’s conduct is then an understandable attempt to save his own life. If another car is about to hit you head on, you may not have the luxury of time to look around you to plot out your best options. Rather, fueled by a legitimate desire to avoid your own death, you reflexively swerve in one direction or another without a chance to look where you are turning. Without the emergency, such behavior would be obviously careless, maybe even reckless. But the sudden emergency circumstance, which is already permitted to be considered as part of the “under the circumstances” description of reasonable care, changes our expectations for reasonableness.</p>

With respect to the mental state of the actor, the reasonable person takes on the trait only of above average intelligence and experience while rejecting consideration of mental disability or below average mental acuity. Physical disabilities are considered on the other hand. Further, while the same standard applies equally (permitting consideration of both grave danger and a sudden emergency), courts will only consider a modified instruction with respect to the latter. The standard seems to change most fundamentally in the case of children, but only when the child is engaged in an activity to which society deems it appropriate for such a child to engage. These various rules seem chaotic at first blush, but there are sound rationales behind each of them. Whether the lawyer agrees or disagrees with such distinctions, competent representation nevertheless demands recognition and awareness of how such circumstances are factored into the analysis of reasonable care.</p>

<p id="65b423b9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">In a sense, by looking at case law discussing the meaning of the duty of reasonable care, we have already seen discussions of whether particular actors, in the factual contexts of those cases, had <i>breached</i> the applicable duty. The courts, and juries, were simply applying the reasonable person standard and theorizing how the hypothetical reasonable person would have acted. By then comparing that theoretical conduct with the actual conduct of the defendant (or plaintiff, where contributory negligence has been alleged), the fact finder can determine if the actor lived up to that reasonable person standard. But analysis of breach can be more sophisticated than what we have seen thus far. First, we will consider the famous <i>Learned Hand Formula</i>, which offers a mathematical formula for analyzing the care that a reasonable person would undertake to prevent an accident. Most negligence cases are analyzed, either explicitly or often implicitly, by reference to this formula. This formula allows for an express consideration of the most important factors in analyzing reasonable care, so that the process becomes somewhat less vaguely intuitive. But there are other potential tools, often considered short cuts, available for analyzing a possible breach of the duty <span title="190" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-190">p. 190</span>of reasonable care. We will consider the impact of an actor’s violation of a statutory duty as evidence of breach of the duty of care. We will also see what role evidence of an actor’s compliance with, or violation of, applicable industry customs will play in the breach determination. Finally, in certain instances where we lack information about the defendant’s actual conduct, but circumstances strongly suggest a negligent act, the doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> will be available to assist an otherwise out-of-luck plaintiff.</p>

<p id="65b44ad2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The high crime rate in the United States has interacted with expanding notions of tort liability to make suits charging hotel owners with negligence in failing to protect their guests from criminal attacks increasingly common. Dula McCarty, a guest at the Pheasant Run Lodge in St. Charles, Illinois, was assaulted by an intruder in her room, and brought suit against the owner of the resort. The suit charges negligence, and bases federal jurisdiction on diversity of citizenship. The parties agree that Illinois law governs the substantive issues. The jury brought in a verdict for the defendant, and Mrs. McCarty appeals on a variety of grounds.</p>
<p id="65b44ad3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1981 Mrs. McCarty, then 58 years old and a merchandise manager for Sears Roebuck, checked into Pheasant Run—a large resort hotel on 160 acres outside Chicago—to attend a Sears business meeting. In one wall of her second-floor room was a sliding glass door equipped with a lock and a safety chain. The door opens onto a walkway that has stairs leading to a lighted courtyard to which there is public access. The drapes were drawn and the door covered by them. Mrs. McCarty left the room for dinner and a meeting. When she returned, she undressed and got ready for bed. As she was coming out of the bathroom, she was attacked by a man with a stocking mask. He beat and threatened to rape her. She fought him off, and he fled. He has never been caught. Although Mrs. McCarty’s physical injuries were not serious, she claims that the incident caused prolonged emotional distress which, among other things, led her to take early retirement from Sears.</p>
<p id="65b44ad4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Investigation of the incident by the police revealed that the sliding glass door had been closed but not locked, that it had been pried open from the outside, and that the security chain had been broken. The intruder must have entered Mrs. McCarty’s room by opening the door to the extent permitted by the chain, breaking the chain, and sliding the door open the rest of the way. Then he concealed himself somewhere in the room until she returned and entered the bathroom.</p>
<span title="191" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-191">p. 191</span>
<p id="65b44ad5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mrs. McCarty argues that the judge should have granted her motion for judgment notwithstanding the jury’s verdict for the defendant.</p>
<p id="65b44ad6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[As one] ground for denying the motion for judgment n.o.v., the district judge correctly pointed out that the case was not so one-sided in the plaintiff’s favor that the grant of a directed verdict or judgment n.o.v. in her favor would be proper. Her theories of negligence are that the defendant should have made sure the door was locked when she was first shown to her room; should have warned her to keep the sliding glass door locked; should have equipped the door with a better lock; should have had more security guards (only two were on duty, and the hotel has more than 500 rooms); should have made the walkway on which the door opened inaccessible from ground level; should have adopted better procedures for preventing unauthorized persons from getting hold of keys to guests’ rooms; or should have done some combination of these things. The suggestion that the defendant should have had better procedures for keeping keys away from unauthorized persons is irrelevant, for it is extremely unlikely that the intruder entered the room through the front door. The other theories were for the jury to accept or reject, and its rejection of them was not unreasonable.</p>
<p id="65b44ad7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are various ways in which courts formulate the negligence standard. The analytically (not necessarily the operationally) most precise is that it involves determining whether the burden of precaution is less than the magnitude of the accident, if it occurs, multiplied by the probability of occurrence. (The product of this multiplication, or “discounting,” is what economists call an expected accident cost.) If the burden is less, the precaution should be taken. This is the famous “Hand Formula” announced in <i>United States v. Carroll Towing Co.</i>, 159 F.2d 169, 173 (2d Cir. 1947) (L. Hand, J.), an admiralty case, and since applied in a variety of cases not limited to admiralty.</p>

<p id="65b44add-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are not authorized to change the common law of Illinois, however, and Illinois courts do not cite the Hand Formula but instead define negligence as failure to use reasonable care, a term left undefined. But as this is a distinction without a substantive difference, we have not hesitated to use the Hand Formula in cases governed by Illinois law. The formula translates into economic terms the conventional legal test for negligence. This can be seen by considering the factors that the Illinois courts take into account in negligence cases: the same factors, and in the same relation, as in the Hand Formula. Unreasonable conduct is merely the failure to take precautions that <span title="192" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-192">p. 192</span>would generate greater benefits in avoiding accidents than the precautions would cost.</p>
<p id="65b44ade-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ordinarily, and here, the parties do not give the jury the information required to quantify the variables that the Hand Formula picks out as relevant. That is why the formula has greater analytic than operational significance. Conceptual as well as practical difficulties in monetizing personal injuries may continue to frustrate efforts to measure expected accident costs with the precision that is possible, in principle at least, in measuring the other side of the equation—the cost or burden of precaution. For many years to come juries may be forced to make rough judgments of reasonableness, intuiting rather than measuring the factors in the Hand Formula; and so long as their judgment is reasonable, the trial judge has no right to set it aside, let alone substitute his own judgment.</p>
<p id="65b44adf-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having failed to make much effort to show that the mishap could have been prevented by precautions of reasonable cost and efficacy, Mrs. McCarty is in a weak position to complain about the jury verdict. No effort was made to inform the jury what it would have cost to equip every room in the Pheasant Run Lodge with a new lock, and whether the lock would have been jimmy-proof. And since the door to Mrs. McCarty’s room was unlocked, what good would a better lock have done? No effort was made, either, to specify an optimal security force for a resort the size of Pheasant Run. No one considered the fire or other hazards that a second-floor walkway not accessible from ground level would create. A notice in every room telling guests to lock all doors would be cheap, but since most people know better than to leave the door to a hotel room unlocked when they leave the room—and the sliding glass door gave on a walkway, not a balcony—the jury might have thought that the incremental benefits from the notice would be slight. Mrs. McCarty testified that she didn’t know there was a door behind the closed drapes, but the jury wasn’t required to believe this. Most people on checking into a hotel room, especially at a resort, are curious about the view; and it was still light when Mrs. McCarty checked in at 6:00 p.m. on an October evening.</p>

<p id="65b44ae3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Learned Hand Formula.</i></b> The formula discussed by Judge Posner, famous himself as a pioneer in the scholarship regarding “law and economics,” was fashioned originally by Judge Learned Hand, a famous Second Circuit federal appellate judge. Judge Hand—once nicknamed the “Tenth man on the Supreme Court”—described his own algebraic formula as a function of three variables (in a case involving a barge breaking free and causing physical damage to other property):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65b44ae4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(1) the probability that she will break away; (2) the gravity of the resulting injury, if she does; (3) the burden of adequate precautions.

What does this formula suggest about the concern the reasonable person has for the welfare of others, that such person would be willing to incur a cost for the benefit of others? Does this reflect how our society actually functions or is it aspirational?</p>

<p id="65b471f9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Flexible Standard.</i></b> We have just finished looking at what “reasonable care is under the circumstances” in the context of such variables as <i>sudden emergencies</i> and <i>highly dangerous activities</i>. Now armed with the Learned Hand formula, go back and consider how you might quantify the logic behind those two doctrines algebraically.</p>
<p id="65b471fa-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Analytically but Not Operationally Significant.</i></b> For various reasons, Judge Posner mentions that the formula is more useful as an analytical tool than in actual operation. Why is this the case? In what ways might the formula be useful analytically? First, when an appellate court (or trial judge) is reviewing a jury’s decision on the issue of breach, this formula permits an enlightened review of the evidence to see if the decision appears to have a rational basis in the facts. Further, when a trial judge is listening to objections as to the relevancy of proposed evidence offered at trial, this formula permits analysis as to whether the evidence tends to make a material fact true or not. In other words, as to the issue of breach of duty, any evidence offered must relate to either the Burden, <span title="194" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-194">p. 194</span>Probability of an accident, or the size of the Loss, in order to be admitted. It also makes sense for lawyers to at least allude to these factors in making closing arguments before a jury on the issue of breach. On the other hand, the court does not instruct the jury on this algebraic equation and the verdict form is not a math quiz.</p>
<p id="65b471fb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Law and Economics.</i></b> While the Learned Hand formula has proven to have enduring value, and doubtlessly refines the analysis of breach of duty in a negligence case, it nevertheless has to be “taken with a grain of salt.” This is true primarily because a mathematical formula cannot capture all of a society’s contemporary values effectively. For example, under the Learned Hand formula, which circumstance would call for heightened care? Scenario A, where a homeless man’s life might be put in jeopardy by the defendant’s conduct? Or Scenario B, where a wealthy corporate executive’s life would be placed in jeopardy? A purely cold-blooded mathematical calculation would suggest that Scenario B requires greater care, as the injury to a high-income earner would yield greater damages than the injury to a homeless person. A lawyer trying to advance such a comparative argument to a jury would be a lawyer with an unhappy client. Despite such real world limits, the field of inquiry plowed by the discipline of law and economics is rich. A good example of the debate over the utility of law and economics can be found in Christine Jolls, Cass Sunstein &amp; Richard Thaler, <i>A Behavioral Approach to Law and Economics</i>, 50 Stanford L. Rev. 1471 (1998).</p>

<p id="65b471ff-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. <i>Burden/Utility.</i></b> The left side of the Learned Hand formula asks, with respect to the plaintiff’s theory of how a reasonable person would have acted, what the costs of this alternative conduct would have entailed. The other side of the same coin might involve placing a value to the defendant on the defendant’s actual chosen activity. The Restatement frames this other perspective in terms of the <i>Utility</i> of the defendant’s conduct:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65b49910-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where an act is one which a reasonable man would recognize as involving a risk of harm to another, the risk is unreasonable and the act is negligent if the risk is of such magnitude as to outweigh what the law regards as the utility of the act or of the particular manner in which it is done.</p></div>

<p id="65b49912-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>6. <i>Problems.</i></b> Judge Posner indicated that the Learned Hand formula was more “analytically (not necessarily…operationally)” useful. With that in mind, address the questions below in light of this scenario: Plaintiff was injured when, <span title="195" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-195">p. 195</span>as a pedestrian crossing a rural highway early one morning to obtain his mail from the box, he was hit by a car coming around a bend in the road, driven by the defendant.

This may strike the claimant’s counsel as a wonderful observation. But what role, if any, should this circumstance play in the analysis of whether the defendant breached a legal duty of care? Is this circumstance even relevant to determining breach? And, if relevant, how much weight should be attached to the fact that the challenged conduct was prohibited by an act of either the legislative or executive branches of government? <i>Martin v. Herzog</i> is the classic case involving an actor whose challenged conduct violated a statute. The trial court was apparently confused as to the significance of this circumstance, as you will see from the vague jury instructions, thereby requiring Judge Cardozo to demonstrate and apply the doctrine of <i>Negligence Per Se</i>. Pay special attention to the prerequisites for this doctrine and its impact on the issue of demonstrating breach of duty.</p>

<p id="65b4c031-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff and her husband, while driving toward Tarrytown in a buggy on the night of August 21, 1915, were struck by the defendant’s automobile coming in the opposite direction. They were thrown to the ground, and the man was killed. At the point of the collision the highway makes a curve. The car was rounding <span title="196" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-196">p. 196</span>the curve when suddenly it came upon the buggy, emerging, the defendant tells us, from the gloom. Negligence is charged against the defendant, the driver of the car, in that he did not keep to the right of the center of the highway (<i>Highway Law</i>, sec. 286, <i>subd. 3</i>; sec. 332; Consol. Laws, ch. 25). Negligence is charged against the plaintiff’s intestate, the driver of the wagon, in that he was traveling without lights (<i>Highway Law</i>, sec. 329a, as amended by L. 1915, ch. 367). There is no evidence that the defendant was moving at an excessive speed. There is none of any defect in the equipment of his car. The beam of light from his lamps pointed to the right as the wheels of his car turned along the curve toward the left; and looking in the direction of the plaintiff’s approach, he was peering into the shadow. The case against him must stand, therefore, if at all, upon the divergence of his course from the center of the highway. The jury found him delinquent and his victim blameless. The Appellate Division reversed, and ordered a new trial.</p>
<p id="65b4c032-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree with the Appellate Division that the charge to the jury was erroneous and misleading. The case was tried on the assumption that the hour had arrived when lights were due. It was argued on the same assumption in this court. In such circumstances, it is not important whether the hour might have been made a question for the jury (<i>Todd v. Nelson</i>, 109 N.Y. 316, 325). A controversy put out of the case by the parties is not to be put into it by us. We say this by way of preface to our review of the contested rulings. In the body of the charge the trial judge said that the jury could consider the absence of light “in determining whether the plaintiff’s intestate was guilty of contributory negligence in failing to have a light upon the buggy as provided by law. I do not mean to say that the absence of light necessarily makes him negligent, but it is a fact for your consideration.” The defendant requested a ruling that the absence of a light on the plaintiff’s vehicle was “<i>prima facie</i> evidence of contributory negligence.” This request was refused, and the jury were again instructed that they might consider the absence of lights as some evidence of negligence, but that it was not conclusive evidence. The plaintiff then requested a charge that “the fact that the plaintiff’s intestate was driving without a light is not negligence in itself,” and to this the court acceded. The defendant saved his rights by appropriate exceptions.</p>
<p id="65b4c033-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think the unexcused omission of the statutory signals is more than some evidence of negligence. It <i>is</i> negligence in itself. Lights are intended for the guidance and protection of other travelers on the highway (<i>Highway Law</i>, sec. 329a). By the very terms of the hypothesis, to omit, willfully or heedlessly, the safeguards prescribed by law for the benefit of another that he may be preserved in life or limb, is to fall short of the standard of diligence to which those who live in organized society are under a duty to conform. That, we think, is now the established rule in this state. Whether the omission of an absolute duty, not willfully or heedlessly, but through unavoidable accident, is also to be characterized as negligence, is a question of nomenclature into which we need not enter, for it does not touch the case before us. There may be times, when if jural niceties are to be preserved, the two wrongs, negligence and breach of statutory <span title="197" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-197">p. 197</span>duty, must be kept distinct in speech and thought. In the conditions here present they come together and coalesce. A rule less rigid has been applied where the one who complains of the omission is not a member of the class for whose protection the safeguard is designed. Courts have been reluctant to hold that the police regulations of boards and councils and other subordinate officials create rights of action beyond the specific penalties imposed. This has led them to say that the violation of a statute is negligence, and the violation of a like ordinance is only evidence of negligence. An ordinance, however, like a statute, is a law within its sphere of operation, and so the distinction has not escaped criticism. Whether it has become too deeply rooted to be abandoned, even if it be thought illogical, is a question not now before us. What concerns us at this time is that even in the ordinance cases, the omission of a safeguard prescribed by statute is put upon a different plane, and is held not merely some evidence of negligence, but negligence in itself. In the case at hand, we have an instance of the admitted violation of a statute intended for the protection of travelers on the highway, of whom the defendant at the time was one. Yet the jurors were instructed in effect that they were at liberty in their discretion to treat the omission of lights either as innocent or as culpable. They were allowed to “consider the default as lightly or gravely” as they would (Thomas, J., in the court below). They might as well have been told that they could use a like discretion in holding a master at fault for the omission of a safety appliance prescribed by positive law for the protection of a workman. Jurors have no dispensing power by which they may relax the duty that one traveler on the highway owes under the statute to another. It is error to tell them that they have. The omission of these lights was a wrong, and being wholly unexcused was also a negligent wrong. No license should have been conceded to the triers of the facts to find it anything else.</p>
<p id="65b4c034-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We must be on our guard, however, against confusing the question of negligence with that of the causal connection between the negligence and the injury. A defendant who travels without lights is not to pay damages for his fault unless the absence of lights is the cause of the disaster. A plaintiff who travels without them is not to forfeit the right to damages unless the absence of lights is at least a contributing cause of the disaster. To say that conduct is negligence is not to say that it is always contributory negligence. “Proof of negligence in the air, so to speak, will not do” (Pollock Torts [10th ed.], p. 472). We think, however, that evidence of a collision occurring more than an hour after sundown between a car and an unseen buggy, proceeding without lights, is evidence from which a causal connection may be inferred between the collision and the lack of signals. If nothing else is shown to break the connection, we have a case, <i>prima facie</i> sufficient, of negligence contributing to the result.</p>
<p id="65b4c035-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are persuaded that the tendency of the charge and of all the rulings following it, was to minimize unduly, in the minds of the triers of the facts, the gravity of the decedent’s fault. Errors may not be ignored as unsubstantial when they tend to such an outcome. A statute designed for the protection of human life is not to be brushed aside as a form of words, its commands <span title="198" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-198">p. 198</span>reduced to the level of cautions, and the duty to obey attenuated into an option to conform.</p>

<p id="65b4e649-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>The Reasonable Person and Statutory Violations.</i></b> The legal effect of a statutory violation in a negligence case, which Judge Cardozo described as “negligence in itself,” is now referred to by courts by the name <i>Negligence Per Se</i>. It is so well established now that one might assume it was natural law. But why should the fact that the challenged conduct violated a statute necessarily lead to the inevitable conclusion that the defendant was negligent? What does this say about the attitude of the reasonable person with respect to compliance with mandatory obligations created by legislative or regulatory enactment? Also, consider whether this doctrine is necessitated by the separation of powers concept forming the foundation for our American system of government. If the trial court’s charge to the jury in <i>Martin</i> had been considered appropriate, what would the judicial branch be saying about its power to disregard decisions by the legislative branch?</p>
<p id="65b4e64a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Specificity.</i></b> In <i>Martin</i>, there was no doubt about the fact that the plaintiff had violated a statute requiring specific conduct—lights on buggies being driven at night. Not all statutes are so specific. Sometimes a statute, such as a traffic code, might demand that a driver “exercise care to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic.” To the extent that a statutory obligation merely adopts the reasonable person standard, it adds nothing to the breach analysis and the doctrine of negligence per se is inapplicable.</p>
<p id="65b4e64b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Effect of Negligence Per Se.</i></b> Which element of the negligence cause of action does negligence per se help to prove? Judge Cardozo clarified that the “unexcused violation” of the statute constituted proof of negligence—breach of duty. Yet for negligence to be something other than “negligence in the air,” it must be proven to be a legal cause of the harm as well. Negligence per se clarifies the duty analysis by giving a very definite expectation for the conduct required, and the statute’s violation then establishes the breach element. But negligence per se does not establish causation. This is why, near the end of his opinion, Cardozo cautioned that the jury would still need to determine causation upon remand. Legal causation is taken up in Chapter 5 of this book.</p>
<p id="65b4e64c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Differing Roles of Law and Fact.</i></b> Negligence per se requires proof of a statutory violation. If the alleged violation is disputed the jury might be called upon to resolve that factual dispute by determining whether the actor did, in fact, violate the statute. Once the statutory violation is proven, however, there is <span title="199" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-199">p. 199</span>no more work for the jury to perform in finding that a breach of duty has occurred, unless the defendant claims that the violation was excused. Often courts will instruct the jury along the lines, “if you find that defendant’s conduct was a violation of [the Code], you are instructed that the defendant was negligent as a matter of law.” The jury may still have to resolve fact disputes concerning the other elements (i.e., causation and damages) but the doctrine of negligence per se focuses the jury’s attention, and traditionally does not permit the jury to disregard the legislature’s decision with respect to what the legislature deems to be reasonable care under the circumstances present in the statutory violation.</p>
<p id="65b4e64d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. <i>Statutes, Ordinances, Regulations, and Codes.</i></b> Judge Cardozo indicated that there had been, at one time, doubts about whether a party’s violation of a municipal ordinance should be afforded the same effect as a statutory violation. Courts now routinely and equally (though not universally) apply negligence per se to violations of statutes, ordinances, codes, and administrative regulations.</p>

It is only when the legislature is seeking to prevent the type of harm suffered in the tort case that we can trust its assessment as to reasonable care. Consider the following case, where the admitted violation of a statute was found not to trigger negligence per se because the harm sought to be prevented was unrelated to the harm at issue.</p>

<p id="65b50d67-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Timothy Matlock, age seventeen, bought two packs of cigarettes from a gas station one day in April 1993. Tim gave one of the packs to his friend, Eric Erdley, age fifteen. Smoking as they walked, the two trespassed onto a private storage facility in Huntington Beach, where a couple of hundred telephone poles were stacked up high upon the ground, held in place by two vertical poles sticking out of the ground. The two had climbed on the logs many times before.</p>
<span title="200" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-200">p. 200</span>
<p id="65b50d68-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Timothy and Eric were joined by 2 younger boys, about 10 or 11 years old, who walked with them on the logs. Eric was smoking a cigarette held in his left hand. Timothy began to tease the younger boys, telling them the logs were going to fall. The boys started to run, though perhaps more out of laughter than of fear. One of the younger boys ran right into Eric’s left arm. Eric dropped his cigarette down between the logs, where it landed on a bed of sand. For about 20 seconds Eric tried to retrieve the cigarette, but he couldn’t reach it. He stood up and tried to extinguish it by spitting on it, and again was unsuccessful.</p>
<p id="65b50d69-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Then Eric caught up with Timothy, who was about 10 feet ahead. They went into some bunkers about 50 feet away; when they came out again after about 20 minutes, they saw flames at the base of the logs. They were seen running from the location.</p>
<p id="65b50d6a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Woodman Pole Company suffered considerable property damage because of the fire. [Eric’s insurance company, Wawanesa, paid $100,000 to settle the tort claims on behalf of Eric. It then filed this lawsuit against Timothy seeking partial reimbursement, or contribution, based upon Timothy’s tortious misconduct being an additional cause of the fire and the property damage. For purposes of this lawsuit, Wawanesa is subrogated to the rights of Eric in seeking contribution against a fellow tortfeasor.]</p>
<p id="65b50d6b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After a bench trial, the court [found in favor of Wawanesa holding that Timothy was liable, in part, based upon the doctrine of negligence per se]. The judge stated that the statute that makes it unlawful to give cigarettes to minors, <i>Penal Code section 308</i>, had to have been enacted in 1891 with “more than health concerns” in mind, “since the health issues on tobacco are of considerably more recent concern.”</p>
<p id="65b50d6c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Timothy and his father Paul now appeal, arguing that there is no basis on which to hold Timothy liable for the damage caused when Eric dropped the cigarette.</p>
<p id="65b50d6d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree. There is no valid basis on which to hold Timothy liable.</p>
<p id="65b50d6e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Just because a statute has been violated does not mean that the violator is necessarily liable for any damage that might be ultimately traced back to the violation. As the court stated in <i>Olsen v. McGillicuddy</i> (1971) 15 Cal. App. 3d 897, 902-903 “The doctrine of negligence per se does not apply even though a statute has been violated if the plaintiff was not in the class of persons designed to be protected or the type of harm which occurred was not one which the statute was designed to prevent.” Mere “but-for” causation, as is urged in Wawanesa’s brief, is simply not enough. The statute must be designed to protect against the <i>kind of harm</i> which occurred.</p>
<p id="65b50d6f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statute that makes it illegal to furnish tobacco to minors, <i>Penal Code section 308</i>, has nothing to do with fire suppression. As it <i>now</i> stands, it is intended to prevent early <i>addiction</i> to tobacco. It may be true, as the trial court opined, that when the first version of the statute was enacted in 1891 <span title="201" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-201">p. 201</span>it was not directed primarily at protecting minors’ health.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN109D0_a3956e69-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N109D0_a3956e69-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d">1</a></span> But it is most certainly a health statute as it exists <i>today</i>. As our Supreme Court recently noted in <i>Mangini v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.</i> (1994) 7 Cal. 4th 1057, 1060, section 308 “‘reflects a statutory policy of protecting minors from addiction to cigarettes.’” The connection of <i>section 308</i> with health is emphasized by the court’s specifically analogizing <i>section 308</i> to former <i>Health and Safety Code section 25967</i>, which states that preventing children from “‘beginning to use tobacco products’” “is” “‘among the highest priorities in <i>disease</i> prevention for the State of California.’” (<i>Mangini, supra</i>, 7 Cal. 4th at pp. 1061-1062, italics added [quoting from appellate opinion quoting statute].)</p>
<p id="65b53481-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nothing suggests that <i>section 308</i> is part of any scheme to prevent fires. Its placement in the general morals section of the Penal Code belies such an intent.</p>

<p id="65b53484-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Negligence Per Se Elements.</i></b> To apply the doctrine of <i>negligence per se</i>, the plaintiff has the burden of proving that (1) defendant violated a statute that prohibited certain particular conduct, (2) that the statute was intended to protect against the harm for which recovery is sought, and (3) that the victim harmed by the violation was part of the class of persons for whom the statute was intended to provide protection. In <i>Wawanesa</i>, remembering that the basis for the relief sought was the fire damage incurred by the Woodman Pole Company, which of these required prerequisites for application of the doctrine were unsatisfied?</p>
<p id="65b53485-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Negligence Per Se Is Not the Exclusive Way to Prove Breach.</i></b> Most claims of negligence are proven by persuading the jury simply that the reasonable person under the circumstances would have acted differently and that this would have prevented the harm—in other words, by resorting to the <span title="202" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-202">p. 202</span>Learned Hand methodology of analysis. Even if negligence per se is unavailable, lawyers must remember that proving ordinary negligence through the Learned Hand formula is always available. In fact, in <i>Wawanesa</i>, the plaintiff also argued that the circumstances present, apart from the statutory violation, also demonstrated a lack of due care by Timothy. In another portion of the opinion, the appellate court acknowledged such a pathway was available to proving breach. Nevertheless, it held that legal causation (a topic we take up in the next chapter) was lacking because the fire was too unforeseeable a consequence of Timothy’s lack of care:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65b53486-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the present case, the connection between Timothy’s initial act of giving Eric the packet of cigarettes and the later fire is simply too attenuated to show the fire was <i>reasonably</i> within the scope of the risk created by the initial act.</p>

<p id="65b53488-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The sentence contains no fewer than three “but-for’s.” In the chain, the cigarette is far less important than the jostling. Yet fires are not within the risks one foreseeably incurs by teasing youngsters, even youngsters in the general vicinity of someone smoking a cigarette. 60 Cal. App. 4th at 588-89.</p></div>
</div>
<p id="65b53489-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Other Tort Theories.</i></b> The plaintiff in <i>Wawanesa</i> also tried to hold Timothy liable for the fire caused by his trespass. The court rejected this final theory, even though Timothy clearly was a trespasser, because the court reasoned that it was not his trespass that actually caused the fire, but rather the trespass of Eric. After we cover <i>actual causation</i> in Chapter 5, you might consider coming back to the facts of this case and seeing if you agree with the court’s conclusion. Looking even further ahead to Chapter 9 (Apportionment), one might also accuse Timothy of conducting himself in <i>concert of action</i> with Eric. That theory would consider the conduct of either member acting in concert to be the same as the conduct of the other member.</p>
<p id="65b5348a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Rationale Behind Prerequisites.</i></b> Even though Timothy admittedly violated a statute, the court refused to use that as a basis for declaring him to have breached his duty of care. Given the rationale behind the doctrine of negligence per se, why is it that courts are not comfortable utilizing the negligence per se “short cut” to declare breach, when the purpose of the statute (or the victim) is different than the harm suffered in the case? If you assume that the legislature was, in effect, trying to do its own math (utilizing the Learned Hand factors) when it crafted the statute, do you understand why, when the harm suffered is different than the harm the legislature feared, there is <span title="203" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-203">p. 203</span>less reason to defer to or trust the legislature’s conclusion on what is “reasonable care under the circumstances”?</p>
<p id="65b5348b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. <i>Caveat Regarding Licensing Statutes.</i></b> A subtle but important limitation upon negligence per se’s application arises when the defendant has engaged in a certain course of conduct without a required license to do so. Driving a car without a license is a common example. Does the fact that the defendant has driven without a license make her negligent per se, even if the <i>manner</i> of her driving was consistent with exercising reasonable care? Courts generally say no, even though the purpose of the license may be to ensure that only qualified, trained citizens drive. The reason has more to do with causation—courts tend to find that the violation of the statute is not what caused the accident. The accident has to be caused by the method of the driving in order to establish a negligence-based liability. Another example involves a “chiropractor” who was practicing without a license. His methods allegedly caused paralysis in the plaintiff and she sued for negligence. At trial plaintiff attempted to rely upon negligence per se. The appellate court rejected negligence per se:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65b55b9c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Proper formulation of general standards of preliminary education and proper examination of the particular applicant should serve to raise the standards of skill and care generally possessed by members of the [chiropractic] profession in this State; but the license to practice medicine confers no additional skill upon the practitioner; nor does it confer immunity from physical injury upon a patient if the practitioner fails to exercise care. Here, injury may have been caused by lack of skill or care; it would not have been obviated if the defendant had possessed a license yet failed to exercise the skill and care required of one practicing medicine.</p></div>

Rather than attempting to rely upon the violation of a licensing statute to prove breach through negligence per se, a lawyer needs to find the violation of a statute that mandates (or proscribes) certain specific conduct that was the cause of the plaintiff’s harm.</p>

If the alleged tortfeasor’s conduct in violating the statute is “excused,” how does this impact the application of the negligence per se doctrine? And what exactly constitutes excuse? Does ignorance of the law count as an excuse? Surely not, for all of us heard before coming to law school the maxim that “ignorance of the law is no excuse.” The following case helps to answer these questions and delineate when conduct forbidden by another branch of government is <i>excused</i>, and thus the doctrine of negligence per se held inapplicable.</p>

It is undisputed that Wenzel had no knowledge, either actual or constructive, as to any defect in the deck that was attached to the condominium. The parties also agree that Wenzel was in no way involved in the discussions concerning the deck between the City, the general contractor, or the subcontractors, and that he lacked any privity of contract with these entities.</p>
<p id="65b582ba-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Following the deck’s collapse, Sikora sued Wenzel, the contractor, and the design company, alleging that each was negligent and therefore jointly and severally liable. Sikora based his claim against Wenzel in part upon a violation of <i>R.C. 5321.04(A)(1)</i>, which requires landlords to comply with all applicable provisions of the OBBC. The trial court granted summary judgment in Wenzel’s favor on the basis that he lacked notice of the defect in the deck.]</p>
<p id="65b582bb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With this decision we confirm that the doctrine of negligence <i>per se</i> countenances lack of notice of a defective condition as a legal excuse. We reverse the appellate court’s determination that notice is irrelevant and strict liability applies, and instead hold that a violation of <i>R.C. 5321.04(A)(1)</i> (failing to comply with the Ohio Basic Building Code) constitutes negligence <i>per se</i>, but that such liability may be excused by a landlord’s lack of actual or constructive notice of the defective condition.</p>
<p id="65b582bc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Negligence <i>per se</i> and strict liability, however, are not synonymous. Courts view the evidentiary value of the violation of statutes imposed for public safety in three ways: as creating strict liability, as giving rise to negligence <i>per se</i>, or as <span title="205" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-205">p. 205</span>simply evidence of negligence. <i>See, generally</i>, Browder, <i>The Taming of a Duty—The Tort Liability of Landlords</i> (1982), 81 Mich. L. Rev. 99. These are three separate principles with unique effects upon a plaintiff’s burden of proof and to which the concept of notice may or may not be relevant.</p>
<p id="65b582bd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Strict liability is also termed “liability without fault.” Black’s Law Dictionary (7 Ed.1999) 926. Thus, where a statute is interpreted as imposing strict liability, the defendant will be deemed liable <i>per se</i>—that is, no defenses or excuses, including lack of notice, are applicable. Areas where the law typically imposes strict liability include liability for injuries inflicted from a dangerous instrumentality, liability for violations of certain statutes, and liability for injuries caused by a manufacturer, distributor, or vendor of certain products. <i>Id.</i></p>
<p id="65b582be-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts generally agree that violation of a statute will not preclude defenses and excuses—<i>i.e.</i>, strict liability—unless the statute clearly contemplates such a result. Notably, most courts refuse to impose strict liability in the context of landlord liability for defective conditions, recognizing the need for some kind of notice element prior to the imposition of liability.</p>
<p id="65b582bf-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More frequently, then, this sort of statutory violation either will be considered as evidence of negligence or will support a finding of negligence <i>per se</i>. As this court has consistently held, the distinction between the two depends upon the degree of specificity with which the particular duty is stated in the statute.</p>
<p id="65b582c0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where a statute contains a general, abstract description of a duty, a plaintiff proving that a defendant violated the statute must nevertheless prove each of the elements of negligence in order to prevail. Thus, proof will be necessary that the defendant failed to act as a reasonably prudent person under like circumstances, to which the defendant’s lack of notice of a defective condition may be a relevant consideration.</p>
<p id="65b582c1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But where a statute sets forth “a positive and definite standard of care…whereby a jury may determine whether there has been a violation thereof by finding a single issue of fact,” a violation of that statute constitutes negligence <i>per se</i>. In such instances, the statute “serves as a legislative declaration of the standard of care of a reasonably prudent person applicable in negligence actions.” Thus the “reasonable person standard is supplanted by a standard of care established by the legislature.”</p>
<p id="65b582c2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Furthermore, negligence <i>per se</i> and strict liability differ in that a negligence <i>per se</i> statutory violation may be “excused.” As set forth in the <i>Restatement of Torts 2d, supra, at 37</i>, <i>Section 288B(1)</i>: “The <i>unexcused</i> violation of a legislative enactment…which is adopted by the court as defining the standard of conduct of a reasonable man, is negligence in itself.” (Emphasis added.) But “an <i>excused</i> violation of a legislative enactment…is not negligence.” <i>Restatement of Torts 2d, supra, at 32</i>, <i>Section 288A(1)</i>.</p>
<p id="65b5a9d3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lack of notice is among the legal excuses recognized by other jurisdictions and set forth in the Restatement of Torts 2d. This excuse applies where “the actor neither knows nor should know of any occasion or necessity for action in compliance with the legislation or regulation.” <i>Restatement of Torts 2d, supra, at 35</i>, <i>Section 288A(2)(b), Comment f</i>. <i>See also, Gore v. People’s Savings Bank, supra</i> <span title="206" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-206">p. 206</span>(applying this excuse in the context of the violation of a statutory obligation upon a landlord).</p>
<p id="65b5a9d4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It follows, then, that a determination of liability and the relevance of notice under a statute imposed for safety depends first upon which of the above categories the statute occupies. Wenzel urges us to construe the violation of <i>R.C. 5321.04(A)(1)</i> only as evidence of his negligence and therefore to consider his lack of notice as crucial to a determination of the breach of his duty of care. Sikora, in contrast, would have us uphold the appellate court’s determination that strict liability applies and that Wenzel’s lack of notice is irrelevant.</p>
<p id="65b5a9d5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We reject Sikora’s argument that the statute imposes strict liability. Considering the general reluctance among courts to impose strict liability in this context, the wording of the statute fails to convince us that the General Assembly intended to create strict liability upon a violation of this statutory requirement. Absent language denoting that liability exists without possibility of excuses, we are unpersuaded that the intent behind this statute was to eliminate excuses and impose strict liability.</p>
<p id="65b5a9d6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor do we agree with Wenzel that the language of that statute is so general or abstract as to constitute merely evidence of negligence. Rather, we believe the statutory requirement is stated with sufficient specificity to impose negligence <i>per se</i>. It is “fixed and absolute, the same under all circumstances and is imposed upon” all landlords. <i>Ornella v. Robertson (1968)</i>, 237 N.E.2d 140, 143. Accordingly, we conclude that the statute requires landlords to conform to a particular standard of care, the violation of which constitutes negligence <i>per se</i>.</p>
<p id="65b5a9d7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having determined that the statute’s violation constitutes negligence <i>per se</i>, we turn now to the question of whether Wenzel’s lack of notice of the defect in the deck excuses the violation. Both parties agree that Wenzel neither knew nor had any way of knowing of the defective condition. The City issued the necessary approval documents despite having failed to reinspect the situation. Because Wenzel was not involved at that point, however, he had no reason to question the validity of the City’s certification. Thus, no factual circumstances existed that would have prompted or required Wenzel to investigate the process that occurred between the City and the developer prior to his involvement. Given that Wenzel neither knew nor should have known of the condition giving rise to the violation of <i>R.C. 5321.04(A)(1)</i>, his violation is excused and he is not liable to Sikora for failing to comply with the OBBC.</p>
<p id="65b5a9d8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>

<div class="epub-heading cc-font-xlarge left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="65b5a9da-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b">NOTES AND PROBLEMS</p></h3></div>
<p id="65b5a9db-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Strict Liability vs. Negligence Per Se.</i></b> The court in <i>Sikora</i> had to decide whether the building code, which imposes liability on a landlord for code violations, imposes strict liability. If so, it is essentially a statutory cause of <span title="207" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-207">p. 207</span>action being pursued rather than a common law tort claim. In that instance, the statutory claim involves strict liability—liability without regard to any showing of traditional levels of any fault. But the court recognizes that strict liability is not presumed from statutes. Because the building code in question did not clearly articulate a desire to impose strict liability, the court interpreted the statute as instead creating a specific duty to act in a certain manner. The court found the defendant in violation of the statute but recognized that negligence per se countenances a defense of <i>excuse</i> by the defendant.</p>
<p id="65b5a9dc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Ignorance of Fact vs. Law.</i></b> The defendant in <i>Sikora</i> was claiming that he had no notice of any defect in the deck, nor did he have any reason to know that the condition of the deck was not in compliance with the building code. The defendant was not claiming ignorance of the building code, but ignorance of the facts that revealed a violation of the building code. Plaintiff’s stipulation that the defendant neither knew nor had reason to know of the defective condition enabled the court to rather easily conclude that defendant’s violation of the statute was excused.</p>
<p id="65b5a9dd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Burden of Proof in Instances Where Violations Are Excused.</i></b> Because <i>excuse</i> is considered a defense, where the plaintiff otherwise proves the elements of negligence per se, the defendant must plead and prove its excuse. Ultimately the issue with excuse becomes whether a “reasonable person under the circumstances” would have likewise been in violation of the statute. Cases involving emergencies or loss of control of a vehicle are classic cases of excuse. One good example of the articulation of how excuse interacts with negligence per se is illustrated by the California Evidence Code, as follows:</p>

<p id="65b5d0f5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Cal. Evid. Code §669 (2002). This statement of the law in California is helpful in demonstrating the prevailing view of the negligence per se doctrine—that it creates a presumption (or prima facie case) of negligence that is capable of being overcome or rebutted by the defendant’s proof that a reasonable person <span title="208" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-208">p. 208</span>would have acted the same as the defendant under the particular circumstances. This highlights the delicate balance of tort law: It defers to the assessment by its sister branches of government of preferable conduct in a general context, while retaining the flexibility to allow a jury to still find the reasonable care standard met when particular circumstances demand conduct different from that generally considered careful.</p>
<p id="65b5d0f6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Types of Excuses.</i></b> Ultimately, a violation of a statute may be excused when the reasonable person would have similarly been in violation of the statute under the circumstances of the case.

<p id="65b5f80f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. <i>Alternative View on Procedural Effect of Negligence Per Se.</i></b> While the typical procedural treatment of negligence per se is illustrated by the above California evidence code provision—where the violation creates a rebuttable presumption of breach—there are a minority of courts that treat negligence per se as merely creating an <i>inference of negligence</i>. In such courts, the plaintiff’s proof of the statutory violation permits the jury to find negligence but does not mandate it, regardless of whether the defendant offers any evidence of excuse. Such courts disagree with Judge Cardozo’s admonition in <i>Herzog</i> that this treatment gives the jury too much “dispensing power by which the jury may relax the duty” created by the statute. The court in <i>Wenzel</i> outlines possible procedural effects from proof of a statutory violation, ranging from supplying mere evidence of breach, to a presumption of breach, and even a type of strict liability where no excuse is permissible. Another good recent judicial discussion of the various procedural views of the effect of a statutory violation is contained in Zeni v. Anderson, 243 N.W.2d 270 (Mich. 1976) (adopting the prevailing view that the proof of a statutory violation creates a rebuttable presumption that mandates a finding of breach in the absence of proof of excuse).</p>

When the defendant is part of a particular industry, what evidentiary value is proof that the defendant has failed to comply with certain industry standards or practices? Should this be treated as tantamount to a statutory violation? Is it even relevant? Or what if a defendant’s conduct conforms to an industry standard or practice? Does this constitute a silver bullet defense to any accusations of failing to observe ordinary care? Other courts commonly cite the following case of <i>The T.J.

<p id="65b61f2f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The barges No. 17 and No. 30, belonging to the Northern Barge Company, had lifted cargoes of coal at Norfolk, Virginia, for New York in March, 1928. They were towed by two tugs of the petitioner, the “Montrose” and the “Hooper,” and were lost off the Jersey Coast on March tenth, in an easterly gale. [The cargo owners sued the tugboat owners for negligence, claiming that their failure to carry radio receivers by which they could have received timely warnings of the weather change caused the property loss. The trial court found in favor of the plaintiffs and this appeal followed.</p>
<p id="65b61f30-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prior to the incident the weather had been fair. The barges got into serious trouble about 70 miles north of Atlantic City as the wind turned into a gale, and the barges eventually leaked in the choppy seas and lost their contents as they sank.]</p>
<p id="65b61f31-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The [tugs] would have had the benefit of the evening [weather] report from Arlington had they had proper receiving sets. This predicted worse weather; it read: “Increasing east and southeast winds, becoming fresh to strong, Friday <span title="210" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-210">p. 210</span>night and increasing cloudiness followed by rain Friday.” The bare “increase” of the morning had become “fresh to strong.” To be sure this scarcely foretold a gale of from forty to fifty miles for five hours or more, rising at one time to fifty-six; but if the four tows thought the first report enough, the second ought to have laid any doubts. The master of the “Montrose” himself, when asked what he would have done had he received a substantially similar report, said that he would certainly have put in. The master of the “Hooper” was also asked for his opinion, and said that he would have turned back also, but this admission is somewhat vitiated by the incorporation in the question of the statement that it was a “storm warning,” which the witness seized upon in his answer. All this seems to us to support the conclusion of the judge that prudent masters, who had received the second warning, would have found the risk more than the exigency warranted; they would have been amply vindicated by what followed. To be sure the barges would, as we have said, probably have withstood the gale, had they been well found; but a master is not justified in putting his tow to every test which she will survive, if she be fit. There is a zone in which proper caution will avoid putting her capacity to the proof; a coefficient of prudence that he should not disregard. Taking the situation as a whole, it seems to us that these masters would have taken undue chances, had they got the broadcasts.</p>
<p id="65b61f32-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">They did not, because their private radio receiving sets, which were on board, were not in working order. These belonged to them personally, and were partly a toy, partly a part of the equipment, but neither furnished by the owner, nor supervised by it. It is not fair to say that there was a general custom among coastwise carriers so as to equip their tugs. One line alone did it; as for the rest, they relied upon their crews, so far as they can be said to have relied at all. An adequate receiving set suitable for a coastwise tug can now be got at small cost and is reasonably reliable if kept up; obviously it is a source of great protection to their tows. Twice every day they can receive these predictions, based upon the widest possible in formation, available to every vessel within two or three hundred miles and more. Such a set is the ears of the tug to catch the spoken word, just as the master’s binoculars are her eyes to see a storm signal ashore. Whatever may be said as to other vessels, tugs towing heavy coal laden barges, strung out for half a mile, have little power to maneuver, and do not, as this case proves, expose themselves to weather which would not turn back stauncher craft. They can have at hand protection against dangers of which they can learn in no other way.</p>
<p id="65b61f33-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is it then a final answer that the business had not yet generally adopted receiving sets? There are yet, no doubt, cases where courts seem to make the general practice of the calling the standard of proper diligence; we have indeed given some currency to the notion ourselves. Indeed in most cases reasonable prudence is in fact common prudence; but strictly it is never its measure; a whole calling may have unduly lagged in the adoption of new and available devices. It may never set its own tests, however persuasive be its usages. Courts must in the end say what is required; there are precautions so imperative that even their universal disregard will not excuse their omission. But here there was <span title="211" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-211">p. 211</span>no custom at all as to receiving sets; some had them, some did not; the most that can be urged is that they had not yet become general. Certainly in such a case we need not pause; when some have thought a device necessary, at least we may say that they were right, and the others too slack. The statute (<i>section 484, title 46, U.S. Code</i> [<i>46 USCA §484</i>]) does not bear on this situation at all. It prescribes not a receiving, but a transmitting set, and for a very different purpose; to call for help, not to get news. We hold the tugs therefore because had they been properly equipped, they would have got the Arlington reports. The injury was a direct consequence of this unseaworthiness.</p>

<p id="65b64647-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Statutes vs. Industry Customs.</i></b> In the famous <i>The T.J. Hooper</i> case, the defendant hoped that the tugboat industry custom was its safe harbor, but the court sunk that argument. Judge Hand, in a bit of hyperbole, stated that “there was no custom at all” yet earlier in the opinion acknowledged that only one tugboat line kept an official working radio on board; all the rest failed to have such a policy. If the doctrine of <i>negligence per se</i> is premised upon deference to legislative (and executive branch agencies’) determination as to what “reasonable care under the circumstances” might sometimes require, why does the court not afford similar weight to an industry’s practices? Does the court say that industry custom might provide some evidence of what ordinary prudence is? If custom is not given controlling, standard-of-care weight, why should it be relevant how an industry normally operates? How might this evidence inform the application of the Learned Hand formula?</p>
<p id="65b64648-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Swords and Shields.</i></b> In cases where the defendant’s conduct has fallen short of industry practices, the plaintiff would be using the evidence of industry practice as a sword to affirmatively establish a breach of the duty of reasonable care. On the other hand, where a defendant is pointing to its adherence to an industry practice, it is using the evidence defensively as a shield to attempt to protect itself from being found liable. According to the court in <i>The T.J. Hooper</i>, and the many cases that have cited it since it was handed down, the legal effect or evidentiary weight given to industry custom is the same regardless of whether it is used as a sword or shield. Practically, however, when might a jury tend to give the industry custom more weight in its determination of the issue of breach—when the defendant company has adhered to the custom (shield) or when the plaintiff shows the defendant company has failed to live up to the custom of others within its own industry (sword)?</p>
<p id="65b64649-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Custom Within the Tug Industry.</i></b> In <i>The T.J. Hooper</i>, who was attempting to point to industry custom and for what purpose? Did the court recognize such a custom? How much weight was afforded to such evidence? Finally, if the court <span title="212" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-212">p. 212</span>had to determine the issue of breach without controlling guidance from industry customs, what tools did the court employ to determine breach? Consider that the author of the opinion is our famous Learned Hand. Notice how he observed the relative inexpensiveness of a tug’s owner maintaining an operational radio on board, and, in the absence of such advance warnings of inclement weather, how exposed the slow moving barges towed by a tug would be in a storm. Do you see how this demonstrates that with a relatively small expense, a tug’s owner can reduce the foreseeable risk to barges caught in all too frequent storms at sea?</p>

<p id="65b6464c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">There are many instances where the defendant has chosen to adopt certain personal customs or policies for itself. Many corporations have detailed policies and procedures manuals designed to impact the conduct of its officers and employees. Do these internal policies create an alternative standard of care? Surely a defendant may not opt out of its tort duty of reasonable care through the adoption of policies. But when the defendant fails to adhere to its own policies, does this provide a shortcut method for finding a breach of the duty of reasonable care? The following case contains an insightful discussion into the problems with allowing an actor’s personal customs or policies to serve as a substitute for the duty of reasonable care.</p>

<p id="65b66d63-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ruth Ann Wright sued for injuries she sustained when she slipped on a puddle of water at the “Outdoor Lawn and Garden Corral” of the Carmel Wal-Mart. Wright alleged Wal-Mart was negligent in the maintenance, care and inspection of the premises, and Wal-Mart asserted contributory negligence. By stipulation of the parties, a number of Wal-Mart’s employee documents assembled as a “Store Manual” were admitted into evidence at the jury trial that followed. Several of these detailed procedures for dealing with spills and other floor hazards. [The store-mandated procedures included requiring employees to “react quickly” to spills, to “never leave a spill unattended,” and to “cordon off” any area containing spills.] At the end of the trial, Wright tendered the following instruction:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65b66d64-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There was in effect at the time of the Plaintiff’s injury a store manual and safety handbook prepared by the Defendant, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., and issued to Wal-Mart Store, Inc. employees. You may consider the violation of any rules, policies, <span title="213" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-213">p. 213</span>practices and procedures contained in these manuals and safety handbook along with all of the other evidence and the Court’s instructions in deciding whether Wal-Mart was negligent.</p>
<p id="65b66d65-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The violation of its rules, policies, practices and procedures are a proper item of evidence tending to show the degree of care recognized by Wal-Mart as ordinary care under the conditions specified in its rules, policies, practices and procedures.</p></div>
<p id="65b66d66-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Wal-Mart objected on the ground that “you can set standards for yourself that exceed ordinary care and the fact that you’ve done that shouldn’t be used, as this second paragraph says, as evidence tending to show the degree that you believe is ordinary. The jury decides what ordinary care is.” The court overruled the objection to Final Instruction 17. The court also instructed the jury that, inter alia, (1) the jury was to consider all the instructions as a whole, and should not “single out any certain sentence or any individual point or instruction and ignore the other” instructions; (2) Wal-Mart was required to maintain its property in a reasonably safe condition suitable for use by its customers;…[and (3)] negligence is the failure to do what a reasonably careful and prudent person would do under the same or similar circumstances or the doing of something that a reasonably careful and prudent person would not do under the same or similar circumstances.…</p>
<p id="65b66d67-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The jury found Wal-Mart liable and assessed Wright’s total damages at $600,000, reduced to $420,000 by 30% comparative fault attributed to Wright. Wal-Mart appealed, contending that the second paragraph of Final Instruction 17 was an improper statement of law that incorrectly altered the standard of care from an objective one to a subjective one. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding the challenged paragraph of the instruction was proper because it “did not require the jury to find that ordinary care, as recognized by Wal-Mart, was the standard to which Wal-Mart should be held,” and because the trial court had not “instructed the jury that reasonable or ordinary care was anything other than that of a reasonably, careful and ordinarily prudent person.” This Court granted transfer.</p>
<p id="65b66d68-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When an instruction is challenged as an incorrect statement of the law…appellate review of the ruling is de novo. Here, Wal-Mart argues that the second paragraph of Final Instruction 17 incorrectly stated the law because it invited jurors to apply Wal-Mart’s subjective view of the standard of care as evidenced by the Manual, rather than an objective standard of ordinary care. Wright responds that the paragraph simply allows jurors to consider Wal-Mart’s subjective view of ordinary care as some evidence of what was in fact ordinary care, and does not convert the objective standard to a subjective one.</p>
<p id="65b66d69-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Initially, we note that implicit in each of these positions, and explicit in the second paragraph of the instruction, is the assumption that the Manual in fact “tends to show the degree of care recognized by Wal-Mart as ordinary care under the conditions specified in [the Manual].” Wal-Mart also objected to this assumption, contending “you can set standards for yourself that exceed ordinary care and the fact that you’ve done that shouldn’t be used, as this <span title="214" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-214">p. 214</span>second paragraph says, as evidence tending to show the degree that you believe is ordinary.” We agree. The second paragraph of the instruction told the jurors that because Wal-Mart has established certain rules and policies, those rules and policies are evidence of the degree of care recognized by Wal-Mart as ordinary care. But Wal-Mart is correct that its rules and policies may exceed its view of what is required by ordinary care in a given situation. Rules and policies in the Manual may have been established for any number of reasons having nothing to do with safety and ordinary care, including a desire to appear more clean and neat to attract customers, or a concern that spills may contaminate merchandise.</p>
<p id="65b66d6a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The law has long recognized that failure to follow a party’s precautionary steps or procedures is not necessarily failure to exercise ordinary care. <i>57 Am. Jur. 2d Negligence §187</i> at 239 (1998) (failure to follow company rule does not constitute negligence per se; jury may consider rule, but rule does not set standard of conduct establishing what law requires of a reasonable person under the circumstances); <i>1 J.D. Lee and Barry A. Lindahl, Modern Tort Law §3.29</i> (1996) (“Company rules are generally admissible but not conclusive on the question of the standard of care.”). We think this rule is salutary because it encourages following the best practices without necessarily establishing them as a legal norm.</p>
<p id="65b66d6b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is a second problem with the instruction. Even if the Manual reflected Wal-Mart’s subjective view of ordinary care, the second paragraph of the instruction incorrectly states the law because it invites jurors to apply Wal-Mart’s subjective view—as evidenced by the Manual—rather than an objective standard of ordinary care. It is axiomatic that in a negligence action “the standard of conduct which the community demands must be an external and objective one, rather than the individual judgment, good or bad, of the particular actor.” W. Page Keeton et al., <i>Prosser &amp; Keeton on the Law of Torts</i> §32, at 173-74 &amp; n.3 (5th ed. 1984). An individual “actor’s belief that he is using reasonable care is immaterial.” <i>Keeton</i>, <i>supra</i>, §32, at 174 n.3. This door swings both ways. A defendant’s belief that it is acting reasonably is no defense if its conduct falls below reasonable care. Similarly, a defendant’s belief that it should perform at a higher standard than objective reasonable care is equally irrelevant. As one court succinctly put it, “a party’s own rules of conduct are relevant and can be received into evidence with an express caution that they are merely evidentiary and not to serve as a legal standard.” <i>Mayo v. Publix Super Mkts, Inc.</i>, 686 So. 2d 801, 802 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1997).</p>
<p id="65b66d6c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Wright cites four cases in support of the instruction: <i>Smith v. Cleveland C.C. &amp; St. L. Ry. Co.</i>, 117 N.E. 534 (Ind. 1917<i>)</i>; <i>N.Y. Cent. Ry. Co. v. Wyatt</i>, 184 N.E.2d 657 (Ind. 1962); <i>Cent. Ind. Ry. Co. v. Anderson Banking Co.</i>, 240 N.E.2d 840 (Ind. App. 1968); and <i>Frankfort v. Owens</i>, 358 N.E.2d 184 (Ind. App. 1976). These authorities support the admissibility of the Manual, which Wal-Mart does not contest. They do not support an instruction to consider any “violation” of the Manual as “evidence tending to show the degree of care recognized by Wal-Mart as ordinary care under the conditions.” We conclude that the second <span title="215" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-215">p. 215</span>paragraph of Final Instruction 17 was an improper invitation to deviate from the accepted objective standard of ordinary care and therefore incorrectly stated the law.</p>
<p id="65b6947d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a jury instruction incorrectly states the law, we assume that the erroneous instruction influenced the verdict and will reverse unless the verdict would have been the same under a proper instruction. This instruction suffered from two flaws. It equated Wal-Mart’s procedures with reasonable care and it asserted that Wal-Mart’s subjective view of reasonable care was relevant. No other instruction corrected these problems. Accordingly, read together these instructions introduced the concept of reasonable or ordinary care, directed the jurors to consider the Manual as evidence tending to show what Wal-Mart “recognized” that ordinary care to be, and thereby implied that a violation of the Manual was a violation of ordinary care.</p>
<p id="65b6947e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judgment of the trial court is reversed. This action is remanded for a new trial.</p>

<p id="65b69485-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">The Learned Hand formula provides a very flexible tool for determining if an actor has met the duty of reasonable care in a broad variety of circumstances. Juries often use evidence of a defendant’s compliance, or lack thereof, with industry custom in their determination of what reasonable care under the circumstances might actually require. And when the legislature has done the math in advance, we presume that a party’s failure to adhere to a relevant statute is a breach of the duty. <span title="216" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-216">p. 216</span>In each of these instances, we have a pretty good idea what the defendant’s specific challenged conduct involved. But is it even possible for a plaintiff to persuade a jury that a defendant has breached its duty in situations where the plaintiff lacks direct evidence of the defendant’s conduct? The evidentiary doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>—which means “the thing speaks for itself”—shows that plaintiffs, even in the absence of direct proof of a breach, might still prevail. The famous case of <i>Byrne v. Boadle</i> introduces this doctrine. After reviewing this case, we will consider a more modern application of its principles.</p>

<p id="65b6bb9d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are of the opinion that the rule must be absolute to enter the verdict for the plaintiff. The learned counsel was quite right in saying that there are many accidents from which no presumption of negligence can arise, but I think it would be wrong to lay down as a rule that in no case can presumption of negligence arise from the fact of an accident. Suppose in this case the barrel had rolled out of the warehouse and fall on the plaintiff, how could he possibly ascertain from what cause it occurred? It is the duty of persons who keep barrels in a warehouse to take care that they do not roll out, and I think that such a case would, beyond all doubt, afford prima facie evidence of negligence. A barrel could not roll out of a warehouse without some negligence, and to say that a plaintiff who is injured by it must call witnesses from the warehouse to prove negligence seems to me preposterous. So in the building or repairing a house, or putting pots on the chimneys, if a person passing along the road is injured by something falling upon him, I think the accident alone would be prima facie evidence of negligence. Or if an article calculated to cause damage is put in a wrong place and does mischief, I think that those whose duty it was to put it in the right place are prima facie responsible, and if there is any state of facts to rebut the presumption of negligence, they must prove them. The present case upon the evidence comes to this, a man in passing in front of the premises of a dealer in flour, and there falls down upon him a barrel of flour. I think it apparent that the barrel was in the custody of the defendant who occupied the premises, and who is responsible for the acts of his servants who had the control of it; and in my opinion the fact of its falling is prima facie evidence of negligence, and the plaintiff who was injured by it is not bound to shew that it could not fall <span title="217" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-217">p. 217</span>without negligence, but if there are any facts inconsistent with negligence it is for the defendant to prove them.</p>

The practical impact of the doctrine, therefore, is not to guarantee a verdict for the plaintiff but to simply give the plaintiff a chance to win. When the doctrine applies, courts recognize that the plaintiff has offered sufficient circumstantial evidence of breach to avoid a directed verdict for the defendant. This doctrine permits the plaintiff to get the issue of breach before the jury. The jury can find the circumstantial inference of breach persuasive or not. Compare this effect with that created by the doctrine of <i>negligence per se</i>.</p>
<p id="65b6bba1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Doctrine’s Prerequisites.</i></b> Stated simply, <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> requires evidence that (1) the nature of a particular accident suggests that it was probably due to negligence (2) the defendant had exclusive control over whatever caused the accident (such that it was the defendant’s negligence) and (3) the plaintiff lacks direct evidence of the event relative to the information available to the defendant. Some courts used to say that the circumstances must also indicate that the plaintiff was not at fault, but this is misleading because item (2) already negates such a requirement and, further, because such language is more a reflection of the common law’s harsh treatment of contributory negligence than an aspect of the doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>.

However, after giving Bronson a dent-removing tool, so as to expedite his work, and instructing him on the use of the tool, he asked him to remove the car as soon as possible. At that moment the telephone (which was on a nearby wall) rang and plaintiff proceeded to answer it. From that position he could see the studio area, but his attention was away from Bronson as he talked on the telephone. While still on the phone, plaintiff glanced back toward where Bronson was working and saw him “flying through the air…at least three feet off the ground—and he landed in the middle of [a plexiglass sculpture].” Four sculptures in all were destroyed.</p>
<p id="65b6e2ba-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Upon the conclusion of plaintiff’s case, defendants moved for a directed verdict on the ground that plaintiff had not presented a prima facie case of negligence. After extended argument, mainly involving the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, the court granted defendants’ motion and directed a verdict in their favor. The judge, in explaining his decision to the jury, indicated that a verdict was directed because plaintiff could not show what caused defendant Bronson’s body to fall or be thrown onto the sculptures.</p>
<p id="65b6e2bb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This information was not only unknown to plaintiff but was peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant Bronson. He, of course, never testified as to any explanation he might have had for the accident, since his motion for a directed verdict was granted. We do not believe a plaintiff ought to be held to that burden on these facts which, left unexplained, support an inference of negligence. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>
<p id="65b6e2bc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is well established, to the extent that a citation of authority is unnecessary, that the mere happening of an accident does not give rise to any inference of negligence. On the other hand, it is established that the circumstances of certain accidents may be such as to justify an inference that negligence was involved. In the District of Columbia an inference that defendant may have been negligent is permitted when the following three conditions exist: first, the cause of the accident is known; second, the accident-producing instrumentality is under the exclusive control of the defendant; and third, the instrumentality is unlikely to do harm without negligence on the part of the person in control. <i>Powers v. Coates</i>, D.C. App., 203 A.2d 425 (1964), citing <i>Washington Loan &amp; Trust Co. v. Hickey</i>, 78 U.S. App. D.C. 59, 61, 137 F.2d 677, 679 (1943). The presence of these factors distinguishes such cases from the vast majority that lack those features, concerning which it is said that negligence is not to be inferred from the mere happening of an accident.</p>
<p id="65b6e2bd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the case before us there is no doubt that the cause of the accident was known, <i>i.e.</i>, the sculpture was damaged by Bronson’s falling on it. To say that the cause of the accident was not known, because there was no evidence as to what caused Bronson to come into contact with the sculptures, “confuses the cause of the accident with the manner in which it was caused, lack of knowledge of <span title="219" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-219">p. 219</span>which, in plaintiff, is a reason for the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur….” <i>Kerlin v. Washington Gas Light Co.</i>, 110 F. Supp. 487, 488 (D.D.C. 1953<i>)</i> aff’d., 94 U.S. App. D.C. 39, 211 F.2d 649 (1954). The doctrine was applied in that case where the evidence reflected that plaintiff, while standing on the sidewalk, was struck by an object propelled from an area where defendant’s employees were digging with picks.</p>
<p id="65b6e2be-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor is there any doubt that the accident-producing instrumentality, Bronson’s body, was within his exclusive control. While falling cans in a supermarket may not be within the owner’s exclusive control, we think it to be a fair presumption that a person’s body usually is within his exclusive control; such is the sub silentio presumption in most medical malpractice cases. <i>See also Kohner v. Capital Traction Co.</i>, 22 App. D.C. 181 (1903). Defendants’ contention that the dent-removing tool was the accident-producing instrumentality, and that Bronson did not have exclusive control over that tool, misses the mark. Moreover, the factual assumption, being without proof on this record, is no more than speculation. As stated, <i>supra</i>, the accident-producing instrumentality was Bronson’s body, the dent-removing tool, if at all involved in this case, was in the control of defendant and would only be related to the “manner in which [the accident] was caused.” <i>Kerlin, supra.</i></p>
<p id="65b709cf-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lastly, as in other situations permitting the application of res ipsa loquitur, we consider it of no small significance that the accident-producing instrumentality, Bronson’s body, is one which is unlikely to do harm in the absence of negligence on the part of the person in control. Such a conclusion does not ignore the possibility of other explanations for the incident, explanations which might not involve negligence; but human bodies do not generally go crashing into breakable personal property. When they do, as here, we think the facts require the court to permit an inference of negligence. The person in control of the body or instrumentality may come forth with an explanation. To have to explain the actions of one’s body is certainly not unreasonable and is less burdensome than to have to explain why a barrel of flour fell out of one’s warehouse onto a pedestrian, a situation to which res ipsa loquitur was held applicable in <i>Byrne v. Boadle</i>, 159 Eng. Rep. 299 (Ex. 1863).</p>
<p id="65b709d0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The instant situation, plaintiff’s art objects being damaged by an inexplicably falling human body, is not unlike that of a parked automobile inexplicably being hit by a moving automobile. In the latter situation a prima facie case of negligence was found to have been presented, though there was no evidence as to why defendant’s car struck plaintiff’s car. <i>Bonbrest v. Lewis</i>, D.C. Mun. App., 54 A.2d 751, 752 (1947); <i>Schwartzbach v. Thompson</i>, D.C. Mun. App., 33 A.2d 624 (1943).</p>
<p id="65b709d1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a case which did involve a bodily collision, <i>Kohner v. Capital Traction Co., supra</i>, plaintiff established only that as he was riding on an open summer streetcar he was injured by “the violent contact of the right hand of the conductor of the car with the face of the appellant….” <i>Id. at 182</i>. Plaintiff was unable to testify as to any negligent act on the conductor’s part or as to the manner in <span title="220" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-220">p. 220</span>which the accident was caused. The court reversed a directed verdict for defendant finding that res ipsa loquitur was applicable.</p>
<p id="65b709d2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Machanic v. Storey</i>, 115 U.S. App. D.C. 87, 317 F.2d 151 (1963), res ipsa loquitur was applied where a car driven by defendant, in which plaintiff was a sleeping passenger, went off the road causing injuries to plaintiff, although plaintiff was unable to produce any evidence as to why the car left the road.</p>
<p id="65b709d3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellees contend that res ipsa loquitur does not apply when the accident-producing instrumentality is a human body. We find nothing in the law of this jurisdiction to indicate that res ipsa loquitur does not apply when the accident-producing instrumentality is a body rather than an inanimate object. In <i>Kohner, supra</i>, the instrumentality was a streetcar conductor’s hand. Medical malpractice cases also involve bodily instrumentalities and it has been held that in a proper case res ipsa loquitur may be applied.</p>
<p id="65b709d4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellees also contend that appellant could not rely on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur because there was an eyewitness to the accident, <i>i.e.</i>, defendant Bronson, and that appellant should have called Bronson as a witness before being allowed to invoke res ipsa loquitur.</p>
<p id="65b709d5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To our knowledge this court has never held that a plaintiff may not invoke the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur when the defendant is an eyewitness. In fact on many occasions we have noted that one of the main reasons for the doctrine is the superior, if not exclusive, knowledge which defendants sometimes have as to the cause of accidents. If requiring a plaintiff to call the defendant as an adverse witness was deemed a sufficient method of determining the cause of an accident, there would be no need for the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. The doctrine exists because of the realization that examination of a defendant as an adverse witness is not a viable way to discover the cause of an accident.</p>
<p id="65b709d6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although there are no cases in this jurisdiction commenting on whether a plaintiff must call an eyewitness-defendant to testify before being allowed to rely on res ipsa loquitur, there have been several where res ipsa loquitur has been applied although an available eywitness-defendant was not called by plaintiff.</p>
<p id="65b709d7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In deciding whether or not res ipsa loquitur is applicable, courts necessarily are mindful of the different effects which that decision will have on the parties and the trial. If res ipsa loquitur is not employed, plaintiff’s case is terminated even though he suffered an injury that was caused by the defendant. If res ipsa loquitur is found applicable, defendant is put to no greater burden than to produce information peculiarly within his knowledge as to how the incident occurred. Even if that explanation is unsatisfactory or indeed even if no explanation is made, the jury is free to decline to draw an inference of negligence, and it is so instructed.</p>
<p id="65b709d8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We find that the plaintiff’s evidence, considered in the light most favorable to him, as must be done in ruling on the motion for a directed verdict by a defendant, was sufficient to raise an inference of negligence so as to survive the defendants’ motion and to put them to their proof.</p>

<p id="65b730f7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Throughout this chapter we have been exploring the standard of ordinary or reasonable care. And we have used the Learned Hand formula to understand how a plaintiff typically proves that the defendant has breached this duty—by failing to undertake a burden less than the foreseeable risk of harm to others. However, tort law sometimes utilizes a different standard other than reasonable <span title="222" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-222">p. 222</span>care. <i>Recklessness</i> is sometimes used as an alternate standard. There can be various reasons for the utilization of a different standard. Sometimes the common law has determined in a certain situation that a defendant will only be liable if they are shown to be reckless rather than just careless. We will see such instances in Chapter 6, Special Duty Rules. Or there might be a statute that provides some degree of protection for certain actors. Chapter 6 will also have some examples of Good Samaritan statutes that sometimes provide a shield against ordinary negligence-based liability for rescuers. Instead, such actors might be liable only when they are reckless. Finally, a plaintiff might want to offer proof of recklessness in order to attempt to recover punitive damages, as in the following case. Another synonym for recklessness is <i>gross negligence</i>. This is sometimes also referred to by the phrase “<i>willful, wanton, or reckless</i>.” All of these phrases—reckless, gross negligence, or willful and wanton misconduct—refer to the same heightened showing. As you read the following case describing alleged gross negligence, consider how gross negligence or recklessness is different than ordinary negligence and how it might be displayed, by reference to the Learned Hand formula.</p>

<p id="65b7580e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Eli Ellender worked periodically as an independent contractor millwright at Mobil’s Beaumont refinery and chemical plants between 1963 and 1977. As a millwright, Ellender repaired, serviced, and cleaned pumps, product lines, and other equipment. While working at Mobil, Ellender was exposed to benzene. He was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia and died in 1989. Ellender’s surviving family, individually and on behalf of his estate, sued Mobil and other defendants, alleging that exposure to benzene caused Ellender’s leukemia and subsequent death. Specifically, the Ellenders alleged that Mobil was negligent [and] grossly negligent in: (1) failing to warn Ellender about his exposure to benzene on Mobil’s premises and the risks associated with it, and (2) failing to protect Ellender from those risks. Just before trial, all defendants, except Mobil, agreed to settle. Before the trial court submitted the case to the jury, Mobil elected a dollar-for-dollar settlement credit. <i>See</i> Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §33.014. The jury found that Mobil’s conduct was grossly negligent and awarded the Ellenders $622,888.97 in compensatory damages and $6,000,000 in punitive damages.</p>
<p id="65b7580f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mobil first argues that there is legally insufficient evidence to support the jury’s findings that Mobil’s conduct was grossly negligent. Gross negligence includes two elements: (1) viewed objectively from the actor’s standpoint, the act or omission must involve an extreme degree of risk, considering the <span title="223" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-223">p. 223</span>probability and magnitude of the potential harm to others, and (2) the actor must have actual, subjective awareness of the risk involved, but nevertheless proceed in conscious indifference to the rights, safety, or welfare of others. <i>See Transportation Ins. Co. v. Moriel</i>, 879 S.W.2d 10, 23 (Tex. 1994). Evidence of simple negligence is not enough to prove either the objective or subjective elements of gross negligence. <i>See Universal Servs. Co. v. Ung</i>, 904 S.W.2d 638, 641 (Tex. 1995); <i>Moriel</i>, 879 S.W.2d at 22-23. Under the first element, “extreme risk” is not a remote possibility of injury or even a high probability of minor harm, but rather the likelihood of serious injury to the plaintiff. <i>See Ung</i>, 904 S.W.2d at 641; <i>Moriel</i>, 879 S.W.2d at 22. Under the second element, actual awareness means that the defendant knew about the peril, but its acts or omissions demonstrated that it did not care. <i>See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Alexander</i>, 868 S.W.2d 322, 326 (Tex. 1993). Circumstantial evidence is sufficient to prove either element of gross negligence. <i>See Moriel</i>, 879 S.W.2d at 22-23; <i>Wal-Mart Stores</i>, 868 S.W.2d at 327.</p>
<p id="65b75810-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mobil asserts that there is legally insufficient evidence of an extreme risk to Ellender of serious injury from benzene exposure at Mobil’s facilities. Mobil argues that the trial court and the court of appeals improperly relied on evidence of Mobil’s conduct and the resultant risks arising after Ellender worked at Mobil. We conclude that legally sufficient evidence shows that, viewed objectively from Mobil’s standpoint when Ellender worked at Mobil, Mobil did not warn contract workers about benzene exposure or protect them from it and this failure involved an extreme degree of risk to those workers.</p>
<p id="65b75811-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is evidence that, from Mobil’s viewpoint during the period Ellender worked at Mobil in the 1960s and 1970s, the extreme degree of risk associated with benzene exposure was common knowledge in the petrochemical industry. As early as 1926, the National Safety Council reported that “the most characteristic pathological effect of [benzene] is perhaps its destructive influence upon the cells of the blood and the blood forming organs.” Mobil stipulated NSC membership dating back to 1922. In 1948, the American Petroleum Institute reported that benzene could cause leukemia and that the only absolutely safe concentration for benzene was zero. The API report also warned that a person should avoid all contact with benzene if possible, but that if the hands must contact the solvent, then a person should use neoprene gloves or protective creams. Mobil stipulated API membership dating back to 1919.</p>

<p id="65b77f25-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dr. R.J. Potts, Mobil’s medical director for the Western region (including Beaumont) from 1960 to 1983, testified that he believed Mobil had knowledge of benzene hazards in the 1950s. The record shows other petrochemical companies had knowledge of benzene hazards. For example, Conoco’s 1953 Employee Safety Manual included information from the 1948 API report and warned that the only safe level of benzene exposure was zero. Conoco also warned that workers should use air masks in case of benzene leaks and neoprene gloves in case of hand contact. In 1948, <span title="224" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-224">p. 224</span>Exxon noted a definite correlation between benzene and cancer. A 1943 report to Shell warned that prolonged exposure to low concentrations of benzene may be very dangerous.</p>
<p id="65b77f26-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is evidence that Ellender’s benzene exposure was dangerously high. Mobil’s own benzene samples, taken at the olefins and aromatic plant where Ellender periodically worked in the 1960s and 1970s, showed dangerous levels of benzene exposure between 1976 and 1978. These levels were many times more than levels the Occupational Safety and Health Administration considered dangerous in 1977. Roy Gatlin, one of Ellender’s co-workers, testified that on many occasions he and Ellender steam-cleaned equipment containing benzene and inhaled benzene. Gatlin and other co-workers also testified that workers used benzene, furnished by Mobil, to wash their tools and hands as often as daily. Russell Witzke, an industrial hygienist at Mobil from 1973 to 1976 admitted that benzene was always being spilled on the ground when piping equipment was connected and disconnected.</p>
<p id="65b77f27-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dr. Eula Bingham, a toxicologist specializing in environmental occupational health, reviewed testimony about Ellender’s exposure to benzene and described it as “substantial.” Dr. John M. Dement, a industrial hygienist and epidemiologist, reviewed the same testimony and described Ellender’s exposure as “significant lifetime exposure that would have put him at increased risk for leukemia.”</p>
<p id="65b77f28-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">David B. Dunham, a Mobil industrial hygienist, testified that although Mobil monitored its employees, it had an “unwritten practice or policy” not to monitor contract workers and that when he attempted to monitor contract workers, he was told not to. Ellender’s co-workers testified that they never saw any signs warning them of benzene hazards at Mobil and that Mobil did not monitor them for exposure or provide them with protective gear when they worked around benzene. Moreover, Mobil did not include any reference to benzene or other chemicals in its 1967 pamphlet entitled “Mobil Safety and Security Regulations for Contract Workers.” Dr. Josh Esslinger, a former medical consultant for Mobil in Beaumont, testified that he knew workers washed their hands in benzene and that such a practice indicated that workers were not adequately warned of benzene hazards. Dr. Dement testified that Mobil’s industrial hygiene program was poor and practically nonexistent for contractors. This is evidence from which the jury could reasonably infer that Mobil had a company policy of not monitoring contract workers for benzene exposure, not warning them of the dangers of such exposure, and not providing them with protective gear and that this policy involved an extreme degree of risk to those workers.</p>
<p id="65b77f29-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that there is legally sufficient evidence that Mobil’s conduct, viewed objectively from Mobil’s point of view when Ellender worked at Mobil, involved an extreme degree of risk to contract workers like Ellender.</p>

<p id="65b77f2a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mobil also asserts that there is legally insufficient evidence of gross negligence’s subjective element. Mobil argues that the court of appeals erred in relying on evidence of general knowledge of some benzene exposure risks to affirm the finding of actual awareness of an extreme risk. Mobil further argues that there is no evidence that a Mobil [executive] knew of an extreme risk to contract workers. We conclude that there is legally sufficient evidence that Mobil…had actual awareness of the extreme risk benzene exposure involves, but nevertheless proceeded in conscious indifference to the rights, safety or welfare of Ellender and other contract workers.</p>
<p id="65b77f2b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dr. Potts, Mobil’s regional medical director from 1960 to 1983, testified that even before he became medical director he knew that benzene caused, among other diseases, aplastic anemia. He knew that washing hands and tools in benzene was hazardous. He further testified that he and Dr. Stewart, a physician working directly under him at the Beaumont refinery, implemented a plan “to see that noxious agents [including benzene] were not being used in a manner that was deleterious to employee health.” Dr. Esslinger testified that Mobil had a policy to conduct blood and urine tests on its own employees for benzene exposure and that he carried out that policy.</p>
<p id="65b77f2c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dunham testified that Mobil had a fleet of industrial hygiene monitors who monitored employees for benzene, among other chemicals, and who sent their results to Mobil’s corporate medical director. Some of these samples, including one sample of a Mobil maintenance mechanic doing work identical to the work Ellender periodically did, showed excessive levels of benzene exposure. Further, in 1969, Mobil’s Employee Relations Division…recognized that long-term benzene inhalation is the most likely source of benzene intoxication and that continuous exposure to benzene affects the formation of red-blood cells in bone marrow. This circumstantial evidence is legally sufficient evidence that Mobil…knew that not providing protective gear, not monitoring and not warning workers about benzene exposure was an extreme risk to contract workers, like Ellender, who routinely came into contact with benzene at Mobil.</p>
<p id="65b77f2d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Furthermore, there is probative evidence that despite this knowledge, Mobil proceeded in conscious indifference to the rights, safety or welfare of contract workers like Ellender. Contrary to Mobil’s policy of warning, monitoring, and protecting its employees, Mobil did not warn, monitor, or protect contract workers from benzene exposure. Dunham admitted that personal monitoring and medical surveillance are the only sure ways to assess a worker’s exposure to benzene. Yet, Dunham testified that Mobil had an “unwritten practice or policy” not to monitor contract workers and that when he attempted to monitor contract workers, he was told not to. Ellender’s co-workers testified that they were not warned about benzene hazards or provided benzene protective equipment and that Mobil actually furnished benzene for workers to wash their tools. Dr. Dement testified that Mobil’s failure to inform workers about benzene exposure reflected Mobil’s conscious disregard for worker safety. Evidence that Mobil <span title="226" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-226">p. 226</span>had a policy of monitoring and protecting its own employees but chose not to do the same for contract workers provides additional facts and circumstances for the jury to infer that Mobil knew the risks of benzene exposure yet proceeded with conscious indifference toward the rights, safety or welfare of contract workers vis-a-vis that risk.</p>
<p id="65b77f2e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because there is legally sufficient evidence that Mobil was grossly negligent, we affirm the jury’s finding of gross negligence against Mobil.</p>

Most courts would add to this definition, as the court does in <i>Mobil</i>, by also requiring that the plaintiff prove that the risk of the activity demonstrate a “high degree of probability” that a “substantial harm” will occur. If you compare this to Learned Hand’s formula for ordinary negligence, how would gross negligence vary that formula?</p>
<p id="65b7a646-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Other Instances Where Gross Negligence Is Used.</i></b> In <i>Mobil</i>, the court uses the gross negligence standard because the plaintiff sought punitive damages. This is a common instance for application of this higher degree of fault. As you will see in Chapter 6 concerning special duty rules, the common law sometimes requires a showing of gross negligence to impose liability even for actual damages. Further, there are instances where statutes mandate gross negligence rather than ordinary negligence as a prerequisite for recovery of actual damages. For example, some states provide by statute a level of immunity for charitable organizations in personal injury claims, making them responsible only for gross negligence.</p>

<p id="65b7cd5c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Gene owns and operates a mid-sized grocery store. Near the holidays he receives incentives from certain food manufacturers to erect special displays on the ends of the aisles in his store. This is a well-established custom in the grocery business. One brewery produces a flavorful beer called “Cheers,” and Cheers pays him handsomely to display large pyramid-shaped stacks of his beer around Thanksgiving. He gets paid a greater amount depending upon the size of the display. Gene builds such a display nearly ten feet tall. Of course, as Thanksgiving approaches, the store is extra busy with customers getting ready for their feasts. The local municipality has a Fire Code that requires retailers to pass an inspection with the fire marshal prior to erecting such displays, to ensure adequate clearance for customers to retreat from a store during an emergency. Gene neglected to do this. Shania is a customer in the store during this time. She has finished filling her cart with items when, as she is passing near the Cheers display, she hears a loud noise as many six-packs of Cheers come tumbling down onto her head, giving her a concussion. She is passed out and has blood pouring from an open head wound. Nobody sees exactly how the incident occurred. Other customers come upon Shania’s body and yell for Gene. Gene runs over, sees the blood on his floor, and angrily stomps to the back room to retrieve a mop to clean up the mess. He’s concerned that he will lose valuable business if he doesn’t clear this up fast. Nobody else intercedes on behalf of Shania and she dies before Gene returns ten minutes later.</p>

<p id="65b7cd60-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">The factors considered by the Hand Formula provide an analytical construct for what is otherwise a purely intuitive method of determining whether an actor has breached the duty of reasonable care. It is a cost-benefit method of taking into account many varying circumstances confronting a particular actor. Its timeless utility lies in its flexibility. Its basic <span title="228" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-228">p. 228</span>considerations can be applied to an infinite variety of circumstances to permit a reasoned analysis of whether the conduct is blameworthy or negligent. Circumstances that can easily be taken into account within the analytical confines of the Hand Formula include sudden emergencies, industry customs, the actor’s adoption of policies and procedures, and certain character traits of the actor in question. As useful as the Hand Formula is, its application demands that the fact finder have some information about the actor’s actual course of conduct and the availability of other alternative courses of conduct. Where that information is lacking (e.g., when barrels fall out of warehouses for unknown reasons), the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur acknowledges that circumstantial evidence may be compelling enough to permit an inference of negligence, despite the inability to scrutinize the actor’s conduct in the typical manner. Finally, when a legislative or executive branch of government has made an effort to prevent particular accidental harms by mandating a specific course of conduct, this can provide a shortcut to determine breach—the reasonable person, after all, seeks to obey the law when reasonably feasible.</p>

The trial judge may have been a little hasty in concluding that health was not the reason behind the 1891 statute. The noxiousness of tobacco was known long before 1891. Back in 1604 James I called it a custom “dangerous to the lungs” in his Counterblaste to Tobacco. By 1630 (give or take a few years), Sultan Murad IV tried to ban the use of tobacco. He failed. For their part, the Puritans of the Massachusetts Bay Colony tried to prohibit smoking about the same time as Murad. They failed as well. Assuming, for sake of argument, that the Legislature did not have minors’ health at heart when it prohibited giving tobacco to them in 1891, the placement of <i>section 308</i> in chapter 7 of title 9 of the Penal Code, dealing with crimes against religion, conscience, and “good morals,” furnishes another answer. While we do not have the legislative history from 1891, it appears the statute was most probably enacted to protect minors from the general licentiousness associated with the consumption of cigarettes in the 1890’s. (These days—though we recognize that there is altogether too much teenage tobacco smoking—cigarettes tend to be associated more with the World War II generation than with cheesy dens of iniquity.) However, we have found nothing, and certainly Wawanesa has cited to us nothing, which would show that <i>section 308</i> was ever enacted out of some concern that minors with cigarettes would pose a fire hazard.</p></div>

<p id="65bdc0db-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Just because a defendant has done something wrong and a plaintiff has suffered harm does not mean that the defendant must pay damages. Tort law demands a link between the defendant’s misconduct and the plaintiff’s harm. <i>Causation</i> is that missing link. When we covered intentional torts an often implicit and unstated requirement was actual causation. For example, a defendant who intends a harmful contact with the plaintiff is only liable when his voluntary act <i>causes</i> a harmful or offensive contact to occur. A defendant who intends to cause emotional distress to a plaintiff is only liable when his outrageous conduct <i>causes</i> the plaintiff to suffer severe emotional distress. This causation requirement is often unstated in the arena of intentional torts because typically causation is not disputed in such cases. But when one enters the world of accidental injuries, causation often plays a vital role. We will first pick up with the test for actual causation—the “but-for” test. This is the same test that would be used both in a negligence case and any other tort cause of action. It is often straightforward and almost intuitive. <span title="230" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-230">p. 230</span>Essentially, it asks the fact-finder to consider a world where all of the facts existing in a case remain unchanged except that the defendant’s misconduct instead becomes acceptable conduct (reasonably careful conduct, in a negligence case). In the hypothesized alternative world, does the plaintiff still suffer the same harm? This test often works well. When it does not, the law of torts sometimes utilizes a different doctrine as a “Band-Aid” to fix the actual causation problem. We will explore the primary doctrines that serve as alternatives to the but-for test.</p>

<p id="65bdc0dc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, this chapter will then explore a second required test for legal causation in a negligence case—proximate cause. As it turns out, merely demanding that the defendant’s conduct constitute a but-for cause often would permit imposition of liability on actors whose conduct was very remote from the plaintiff’s harm. Without this additional check or limitation upon liability, the common notion is that some defendants would unfairly be found liable. We will explore the primary tests different courts use today for proximate cause.</p>

<p id="65bdc0e1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">In order to demonstrate the necessary nexus between the defendant’s misconduct and the plaintiff’s harm, a plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the misconduct was essential to bringing about the harm—that without the misconduct the plaintiff would not have suffered the complained of injury. In many scenarios this is not too difficult. A hunter in the woods fires toward his prey without carefully surveying the area for other hunters and accidentally shoots a fellow hunter in the leg. It is not difficult to demonstrate actual but-for causation in this simple yet realistic scenario. Had the hunter not fired his weapon without ensuring that the coast was clear, the injury would not have likely occurred. Sometimes but-for causation is more complicated. In cases where it is not exactly clear how the accident even occurred, demonstrating actual causation might not be so intuitively obvious. <i>Cay</i> clarifies the actual burden of proving but-for causation in circumstances where the plaintiff’s death is somewhat of a mystery. The <i>Lyons</i> case highlights the importance on focusing upon whether the <i>wrongful</i> conduct of the defendant was a cause of the claimant’s harm rather than some other innocent conduct by the defendant. And finally the <i>East Texas Theatres</i> case shows an example where plaintiff might be able to prove defendant’s negligence but it appears the harm would have occurred even had the defendant acted reasonably.</p>

<p id="65bde6f8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is a wrongful death action filed by the parents of Keith Cay, who was killed in a fall from a bridge constructed and maintained by the Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD). [A] principal issue [is] whether plaintiffs proved that DOTD’s construction of the bridge railing at a height lower than the minimum standard for pedestrian traffic was a cause-in-fact of Cay’s fall from the bridge.…</p>
<p id="65bde6f9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Cay, a twenty-seven-year-old single offshore worker, returned to his home in Sandy Lake from a seven-day work shift on November 3, 1987. Later that afternoon his sister drove him to Jonesville, thirteen miles from his home, to obtain a hunting license and shotgun shells for a hunting trip the next day. Cay cashed a check for $60.00 and paid for the hunting items, but remained in Jonesville when his sister returned to Sandy Lake about 7:00 p.m. Around 10:00 p.m. Cay entered a barroom and stayed until about 11:00 p.m., when he left the barroom on foot after declining an offer for a ride to his home. He carried an opened beer with him.</p>
<p id="65bde6fa-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Five days later, Cay’s body was discovered on a rock bank of the Little River, thirty-five feet below the bridge across the river. Cay would have had to cross the bridge in order to travel from Jonesville to his home.</p>
<p id="65bde6fb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Cay’s body was found in a thicket of brambles and brush. The broken brush above the body and the lack of a path through the brush at ground level indicated that Cay had fallen from the bridge. There was no evidence suggesting suicide or foul play. [Cay had just purchased a hunting license and supplies.] There was evidence, however, that Cay, who was wearing dark clothes, was walking on the wrong side of the road for pedestrian traffic and was intoxicated.</p>

The side railings were thirty-two inches high, the minimum height under existing standards for bridges designed for vehicular traffic. There were no curbs, sidewalks or separate railings for pedestrian traffic, although it was well known that many pedestrians had used the old bridge to cross the river to communities and recreation areas on the other side.</p>
<p id="65bde700-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Cay’s parents filed this action against DOTD, seeking recovery on the basis that the guard railings on the sides of the bridge were too low and therefore unsafe for pedestrians whom DOTD knew were using the bridge and that DOTD failed to provide pedestrian walkways or signs warning pedestrians about the hazardous conditions.</p>

<p id="65bde701-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court rendered judgment for plaintiffs, concluding that Cay accidently fell from the bridge. The court held that the fall was caused in part by the inadequate railing and in part by Cay’s intoxicated condition. Pointing out that DOTD had closed the old bridge to both vehicular and pedestrian traffic and should have been aware that numerous pedestrians would use the new bridge to reach a recreational park, the Trinity community and other points across the river from Jonesville, the court found that DOTD breached its duty to pedestrians by failing to build the side railings to a height of thirty-six inches, as required by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) standards for pedestrian railings. The court concluded that this construction deficiency was a cause of the accident in that “a higher rail would have prevented the fall.” Noting that there was no evidence establishing what actually caused the incident, the court surmised that Cay was “startled by oncoming traffic, moved quickly to avoid perceived danger, tripped over the low rail, lost his balance, and with nothing to prevent the fall, fell from the Little River Bridge.” The court apportioned fault sixty percent to DOTD and forty percent to Cay.</p>
<p id="65bde702-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court of appeal affirmed. The court concluded that the inadequate railing was a cause-in-fact of the accident, stating, “It is true that the accident might have occurred had the railing been higher. However, it is also true that the accident might not have happened had the railing been higher.” The court further stated, “Had the railing been higher, the decedent might have been able to avoid the accident.”</p>

The causation inquiry is whether that failure caused Cay’s fall or, conversely, whether the fall would have been prevented if DOTD had constructed the railing at least thirty-six inches high.</p>
<p id="65be0e1a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The determination of whether a higher railing would have prevented Cay’s fall depends on how the accident occurred.

<p id="65be0e1b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The circumstantial evidence did not establish the exact cause of Cay’s fall from the bridge, but it is more likely than not that Cay’s going over the side was not intentional, either on his part or of the part of a third party. More probably than not, Cay did not commit suicide, as evidence of plans and preparation for a hunting trip minimize this possibility. More probably than not, he was not pushed, as he had little money or valuables on his person, and the evidence from barroom patrons does not suggest any hostility toward or by him during the evening. More likely than not, he was not struck by a vehicle and knocked over the railing. It is therefore most likely that he accidently fell over the railing.</p>
<p id="65be0e1c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The evidence suggests that Cay moved at a sharp angle toward the railing, for some unknown reason, and stumbled over. For purposes of the cause-in-fact analysis, it matters little whether his movement toward the railing was prompted by perceived danger of an approaching automobile or by staggering in an intoxicated condition or for some other reason. Whatever the cause of Cay’s movement toward the railing at a sharp angle, the cause-in-fact inquiry is whether a higher railing would have prevented the accidental fall.</p>

<p id="65be3536-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>The “But-For” Test</i>.</b> The <i>Cay</i> court articulates a simple test for actual causation and applies it to a case where mystery abounds. In order to determine if the defendant’s negligence—building the railing on the bridge four inches too low—caused the decedent’s death, the court must determine what <i>probably</i> happened on that evening. The intermediate court of appeals believed causation was present if the negligence “might have” made a difference. The Louisiana Supreme Court rejects this—because the plaintiff’s burden in a civil case is to prove each element by a “preponderance” of the evidence. Once the court determines what probably happened—that the decedent stumbled toward the railing and fell over it—the application of the “but-for” test is fairly straightforward. Because the railing should have been designed to exceed a typical adult’s center of gravity, there is persuasive evidence that the low railing was an essential fact that led to the death.</p>
<p id="65be3537-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>The Number of “But-For” Causes of an Accident.</i></b> In <i>Cay,</i> the trial court found two essential causes: (1) the decedent’s intoxication and (2) the defendant’s negligence. In fact, when taken to its logical extreme there are virtually an infinite number of but-for causes for any event. In <i>Cay</i>, had the plaintiff not declined a ride from another patron of the bar he could not have fallen off the bridge. Had the plaintiff’s sister not driven him to the town he would not have fallen off the bridge. Had he not made the decision to purchase a hunting license he would not have fallen off the bridge. Had his parents never been born, he would not have fallen off the bridge. The point of all of this is that but-for cause is not a search for a lone cause—there is no such thing. It is merely an analysis of whether the defendant’s act or omission of negligence is <i>one of the essential links</i> in the chain of causation that led to the harm.</p>

<p id="65be5c52-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Esther Hunter-Lyons was killed when her Volkswagen van was struck broadside by a truck driven by David Jette and owned by Midnight Sun Transportation Services, Inc. When the accident occurred, Jette was driving south in the right-hand lane of Arctic Boulevard in Anchorage. Hunter-Lyons pulled out of a parking lot in front of him. Jette braked and steered to the left, but Hunter-Lyons continued to pull out further into the traffic lane. Jette’s truck collided with Hunter-Lyons’s vehicle. David Lyons, the deceased’s husband, filed suit, asserting that Jette had been speeding and driving negligently.</p>
<p id="65be5c53-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At trial, conflicting testimony was introduced regarding Jette’s speed before the collision. Lyons’s expert witness testified that Jette may have been driving as fast as 53 miles per hour. Midnight Sun’s expert testified that Jette probably had been driving significantly slower and that the collision could have occurred even if Jette had been driving at the speed limit, 35 miles per hour. Lyons’s expert later testified that if Jette had stayed in his own lane, and had not steered to the left, there would have been no collision. Midnight Sun’s expert contended that steering to the left when a vehicle pulls out onto the roadway from the right is a normal response and is generally the safest course of action to follow.</p>
<p id="65be5c54-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Over Lyons’s objection, the jury was given an instruction on the sudden emergency doctrine. The jury found that Jette, in fact, had been negligent, but his negligence was not a legal cause of the accident. [The Alaska Supreme Court decided that it no longer would approve of use of the sudden emergency instruction but that it was harmless because the jury found negligence in favor of the plaintiff anyway.]</p>
<p id="65be5c55-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lyons’s claims were defeated on the basis of lack of causation. Although the jury found Jette to have been negligent, it also found that this negligence was <i>not</i> the legal cause of the accident. Duty, breach of duty, causation, and harm are the separate and distinct elements of a negligence claim, all of which must be proven before a defendant can be held liable for the plaintiff’s injuries.</p>

<p id="65be5c56-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Further, we cannot say that the jury’s finding of lack of causation was unreasonable. There was evidence presented at trial from which the jury could reasonably have drawn the conclusion that even though Jette was driving negligently, his negligence was not the cause of the accident. Midnight Sun introduced expert testimony to the effect that the primary cause of the accident was Ms. Hunter-Lyons’s action in pulling out of the parking lot in front of an oncoming truck. Terry Day, an accident reconstruction specialist testified that, depending on how fast Ms. Hunter-Lyons was moving, the accident could have happened even if Jette had been driving within the speed limit. Midnight Sun also introduced expert testimony to the effect that Jette responded properly to the unexpected introduction of an automobile in his traffic lane. Although all of this testimony was disputed by Lyons, a reasonable jury could have concluded that Ms. Hunter-Lyons caused the accident by abruptly pulling out in front of an oncoming truck, and that David Jette’s negligence was not a contributing factor. With the element of causation lacking, even the most egregious negligence cannot result in liability.</p>

<p id="65be5c5d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is a damage suit alleging personal injuries were sustained by Sheila Rutledge, on or about September 25, 1966, while attending a midnight movie in a theatre owned and operated by East Texas Theatres, Inc. The suit was brought by Sheila, joined by her husband, against East Texas Theatres, Inc. alleging that certain acts of negligence on the part of the theatre were a proximate cause of the injuries Sheila sustained while a patron of the theatre. The jury found the defendant guilty of negligence in failing to remove certain unidentified “rowdy persons” from the theatre and that such negligence was a cause of Sheila’s injuries. Damages were assessed by the jury at $31,250.00. Based upon the jury findings, the trial court entered judgment for the plaintiffs. The Court of Civil Appeals has affirmed. We reverse the judgments of both courts and here render judgment that the plaintiffs take nothing. [Defendant contends on appeal that the evidence of causation was insufficient to support this judgment.]</p>
<p id="65be5c5e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On September 24 and the early morning of September 25, 1966, Sheila, a paying guest, was attending a special “midnight show” at the Paramount Theatre, one of the several theatres owned by the defendant. The interior of the theatre was arranged with a lower floor and a balcony for the seating of patrons. Sheila and her friends took seats on the lower floor out beyond the overhang of the balcony. When the picture came to an end, Sheila started making her exit. As <span title="237" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-237">p. 237</span>she proceeded up the aisle toward the front of the building for the purpose of leaving the theatre and just before she walked under the balcony overhang, some unidentified person in the balcony threw a bottle which struck her on the side of her head just above her left ear.</p>

<p id="65be5c60-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since the jury found that the patrons in the balcony were acting in a “rowdy” manner and that the defendant negligently failed to remove such rowdy persons from the premises and that such negligence caused the injuries sustained by Sheila, we deem it important to particularly point out the evidence bearing on the conduct of the patrons during the evening. The evidence favorable to the verdict is that during the progress of the show, the patrons in the theatre, both on the lower floor and in the balcony, were engaged in “hollering.” Sheila, in describing the “hollering,” said that “a few slang words” were used. This “hollering” was intermittent; it occurred “off and on” during “parts of” the movie. One witness testified that “…they would holler and maybe slack off a few minutes and then holler again.” Buddy Henderson [a witness] testified that he saw paper or cold drink cups either “drifting down” or being thrown down toward the front of the theatre. Sheila did not see throwing of any type. Henderson testified that he did not recall anything drifting down or being thrown down other than the paper cold drink cups. In regard to the duration of the commotion in the theatre, the evidence shows that there was more commotion on the lower floor than in the balcony. Henderson testified that he thought that the “hollering” seemed to get worse toward the end of the show. Sheila was certain that “…[about] 30 minutes before the show was over it seemed to be quieter; they didn’t seem to be as rowdy then.” Sheila, Henderson and an officer by the name of Burt, all agreed in their testimony that before the show was over, and, thus, before the accident, all commotion in the theatre had ceased. The last disturbance of any kind before the show was over was not throwing but “hollering.” Henderson further testified that nothing happened, whether “hollering” or the throwing of paper cups, to make him think that something bad was going to happen; he was not worried about the safety of himself or the safety of his friends or anybody that was there.</p>
<p id="65be5c61-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The balcony, which would seat 263 people, was “just about full.” The witness, Burt, estimated that about 175 of the balcony seats were occupied. The disturbance in the balcony seemed to come from the balcony generally, “just all over it.” The evidence does not identify any particular person as being a “rowdy person.” No witness could state which persons in the balcony were rowdy and which were not. No witness could identify the person who threw the bottle. Incidentally, there is no evidence that a hard substance of any character was thrown, other than the bottle which struck Sheila. The witness, Henderson, testified that he could not identify the person who threw the bottle, but that out of the corner of his eye, he saw a “movement, a jerking motion” by someone in the balcony and then saw the bottle hit Sheila. No <span title="238" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-238">p. 238</span>witness testified that the bottle thrower had been engaged in “hollering” or throwing paper cups.</p>
<p id="65be5c62-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Assuming without deciding that the finding of negligence is supported by evidence of probative force, we go direct to the question of whether there is in the record evidence or probative force to support the finding of cause. We hold that there is no evidence to support the finding of the jury that the failure of the defendant to remove “rowdy persons” from its premises was a cause of Sheila’s injuries.</p>
<p id="65be5c63-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[In order to find a negligent actor liable for the claimant’s injuries] there must be cause in fact—a cause which produces an event and without which the event would not have occurred. “An essential element of the plaintiff’s cause of action for negligence is that there be some reasonable connection between the act or omission of the defendant and the damage which the plaintiff has suffered.” Prosser, Law of Torts (3rd Ed.) 240-41 (1964). We base our decision here on the ground that the plaintiffs have failed to offer evidence of probative force to establish the cause-in-fact element of [causation]. In particular, the plaintiffs contend that the act of omission in failing to remove “rowdy persons” from the theatre was a cause of the injuries resulting from the throwing of the bottle by an unknown patron of the theatre. We recognize that cause-in-fact covers the defendant’s omissions as well as its acts. However, it cannot be said from this record that had the defendant removed the “rowdy persons” from the premises, the bottle thrower would not have thrown the bottle. The record in this case clearly shows a complete lack of proof that the bottle would not have been thrown “but for” the failure of the defendant to remove “rowdy persons” from the premises. There is no evidence that the bottle thrower was one of the “rowdy persons” engaged in “hollering” and throwing paper cups from the balcony. We cannot say from this evidence what persons would have been removed.</p>
<p id="65be5c64-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We recognize that the theatre was under a duty to exercise reasonable care for the safety of its patrons. However, operators of theatres are not insurers of their patrons’ safety.</p>

<p id="65be8378-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Connecting the Dots.</i></b> In <i>Lyons,</i> there was both evidence that the defendant was negligent (in driving too fast) and that his veering the car to the left resulted in the collision. Given this evidence, how could the court uphold a jury finding of negligence but no causation? The point is that one must ask whether the negligent act was a but-for cause of the harm. Just because veering to the left may have been a cause of the accident, if this defensive maneuver was justified rather than negligent, its causal connection to the accident is irrelevant. Rather, if the lone act of negligence was the speeding, the focus then shifts to <span title="239" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-239">p. 239</span>whether the additional speed made a difference in the outcome. In this case, it appears the jury credited the testimony of the defendant’s expert witness who said that the collision would have occurred regardless of whether the defendant was going 35 m.p.h. or 53 m.p.h.</p>
<p id="65be8379-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Plaintiff’s Burden.</i></b> In <i>East Texas Theatres</i>, the court also is willing to concede possible negligence by the theatre operator in failing to remove rowdy audience members from the balcony. Given that the bottle that hit the plaintiff was thrown from the balcony, why does the court affirm a summary judgment for the defendant based upon causation? Recall that the plaintiff must prove but-for causation by a preponderance of the evidence. Did the plaintiff offer such evidence to support the theory that if the defendant had removed the rowdy persons that this probably would have prevented the plaintiff’s injuries? What more would the plaintiff have had to show in this scenario to avoid summary judgment?</p>

<p id="65be837c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">The but-for test for actual causation intuitively makes sense and resolves the issue of whether the defendant’s (or plaintiff’s) negligence matters. That is, was the misconduct “negligence in the air,” as Judge Cardozo mentioned in <i>Martin v. Herzog</i> (i.e., lacking in causation), or did the actor’s misconduct have a logical connection with the plaintiff’s harm such that the party’s negligence should make them responsible? If the but-for test is satisfied, a defendant is liable to the plaintiff for the plaintiff’s resulting losses. If the test is not satisfied, the plaintiff loses. Normally this is the approach taken. But there are certain recurring factual scenarios where the but-for test cannot be satisfied, yet permitting the tortfeasors to escape liability would be unjust. In these few exceptional scenarios, courts have dispensed with the but-for test and utilized one of a few other doctrines to save the plaintiff’s cause of action. One scenario involves <i>Multiple Sufficient Independent Causes</i> for the plaintiff’s harm. A different, but related, situation involves two similarly acting tortfeasors where only one of them could have actually caused the harm, but plaintiff has no way to determine which of the two is responsible. <i>Alternative Liability</i> is a theory that applies to this instance and provides motivation for the two tortfeasors to help explain the mystery rather than facing liability. We will see a related doctrine, <i>Modified Alternative Liability</i> (a.k.a. “market share liability”), applied in scenarios where alternative liability is inapplicable but plaintiffs are still hampered in their efforts to prove causation when injured by a fungible product sold by multiple manufacturers. Finally, in the field of medical malpractice and toxic torts we will see some courts utilize a test other than but-for causation where the defendant’s tortious misconduct has either decreased a plaintiff’s chances for cure or increased the plaintiff’s chances for illness, though the misconduct probably did not actually alter the outcome. These two related doctrines—<i>Loss of Chance</i> <span title="240" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-240">p. 240</span>and <i>Increased Risk of Harm</i>—often help plaintiffs who seem to have been harmed in some sense yet cannot prove but-for causation.</p>

<p id="65be837f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Normally a tort victim who has been victimized by the misconduct of more than one tortfeasor would seem to be in a relatively good position as a strategic proposition. Even if one tortfeasor had insufficient assets, at least there would be another able to pay. How could it possibly be a bad thing to have two tortfeasors to go after? While this is often true, in some instances it may be that neither one can be considered a true but-for cause of the harm. Unless there is a new doctrine available to help rescue the plaintiff’s tort cause of action, this <i>conceptual but-for dilemma</i> would leave a legitimately harmed plaintiff without any means of receiving compensation and the tortfeasors would go unpunished. The following is a classic case involving just such a scenario. Consider the rationale behind the court recognizing and applying an alternative means of recovery.</p>

<p id="65be8386-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The jury found that both fires were set by sparks emitted from locomotives on and over defendant’s right of way. Appellant contends that there is no evidence to support the finding that either fire was so set. We have carefully examined the record and have come to the conclusion that the evidence does support the finding that the northeast fire was set by sparks emitted from a locomotive then being run on and over the right of way of defendant’s main line. We conclude, however, that the evidence does not support the finding that the northwest fire was set by sparks emitted from defendant’s locomotives or that the defendant had any connection with its origin.</p>
<p id="65be8387-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We therefore have this situation: The northeast fire was set by sparks emitted from defendant’s locomotive. This fire, according to the finding of the jury, constituted a proximate cause of the destruction of plaintiff’s property. This finding we find to be well supported by the evidence. We have the northwest fire, of unknown origin. This fire, according to the finding of the jury, also constituted a proximate cause of the destruction of the plaintiff’s property. This finding we also find to be well supported by the evidence. We have a union of these two fires 940 feet north of plaintiff’s property, from which point the united fire bore down upon and destroyed the property. We therefore have two <span title="241" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-241">p. 241</span>separate, independent, and distinct agencies, each of which constituted the proximate cause of plaintiff’s damage, and either of which, in the absence of the other, would have accomplished such result.</p>
<p id="65beaa98-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is settled in the law of negligence that any one of two or more joint tortfeasors, or one of two or more wrongdoers whose concurring acts of negligence result in injury, are each individually responsible for the entire damage resulting from their joint or concurrent acts of negligence.

The whole loss must necessarily be considered and treated as an entirety.</p>
</div>
<p id="65beaa9a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Cook v. M., St. P. &amp; S.S.M.R. Co.</i>, 98 Wis. 624 (74 N.W. 561), at p. 642. That case presented a situation very similar to this. One fire, originating by sparks emitted from a locomotive, united with another fire of unknown origin and consumed plaintiffs’ property. There was nothing to indicate that the fire of unknown origin was not set by some human agency. The evidence in the case merely failed to identify the agency. In that case it was held that the railroad company which set one fire was not responsible for the damage committed by the united fires because the origin of the other fire was not identified. In that case a rule of law was announced [concerning the situation where one fire is started by another’s negligence but the second fire is of no known responsible origin. Either fire, had the other not existed, would have reached the property and caused the harm. Therefore, plaintiff can have no recovery].</p>
<p id="65beaa9b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Emphasis is placed upon the fact, especially in the opinion, that one fire had “no responsible origin.” At other times in the opinion the fact is emphasized that it had no “known responsible origin.” The plain inference from the entire opinion is that if both fires had been of responsible origin, or of known responsible origin, each wrongdoer would have been liable for the entire damage. The conclusion of the court exempting the railroad company from liability seems to be based upon the single fact that one fire had no responsible origin or no known responsible origin. It is difficult to determine just what weight was accorded to the fact that the origin of the fire was unknown. If the conclusion of the court was founded upon the assumption that the fire of unknown origin had no responsible origin, the conclusion announced may be sound and in harmony with well settled principles of negligence.</p>
<p id="65beaa9c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From our present consideration of the subject we are not disposed to criticize the doctrine which exempts from liability a wrongdoer who sets a fire which unites with a fire originating from natural causes, such as lightning, not attributable to any human agency, resulting in damage. It is also conceivable that a fire so set might unite with a fire of so much greater proportions, such as <span title="242" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-242">p. 242</span>a raging forest fire, as to be enveloped or swallowed up by the greater holocaust, and its identity destroyed, so that the greater fire could be said to be an intervening or superseding cause. But we have no such situation here. These fires were of comparatively equal rank. If there was any difference in their magnitude or threatening aspect, the record indicates that the northeast fire was the larger fire and was really regarded as the menacing agency. At any rate there is no intimation or suggestion that the northeast fire was enveloped and swallowed up by the northwest fire. We will err on the side of the defendant if we regard the two fires as of equal rank.</p>
<p id="65beaa9d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to well settled principles of negligence, it is undoubted that if the proof disclosed the origin of the northwest fire, even though its origin be attributed to a third person, the railroad company, as the originator of the northeast fire, would be liable for the entire damage. There is no reason to believe that the northwest fire originated from any other than human agency. It was a small fire. It had traveled over a limited area. It had been in existence but for a day. For a time it was thought to have been extinguished. It was not in the nature of a raging forest fire. The record discloses nothing of natural phenomena which could have given rise to the fire. It is morally certain that it was set by some human agency.</p>
<p id="65beaa9e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now the question is whether the railroad company, which is found to have been responsible for the origin of the northeast fire, escapes liability because the origin of the northwest fire is not identified, although there is no reason to believe that it had any other than human origin. An affirmative answer to that question would certainly make a wrongdoer a favorite of the law at the expense of an innocent sufferer. The injustice of such a doctrine sufficiently impeaches the logic upon which it is founded. Where one who has suffered damage by fire proves the origin of a fire and the course of that fire up to the point of the destruction of his property, one has certainly established liability on the part of the originator of the fire. Granting that the union of that fire with another of natural origin, or with another of much greater proportions, is available as a defense, the burden is on the defendant to show that by reason of such union with a fire of such character the fire set by him was not the proximate cause of the damage. No principle of justice requires that the plaintiff be placed under the burden of specifically identifying the origin of both fires in order to recover the damages for which either or both fires are responsible.</p>

<p id="65bed1b8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Nature of But-For Problem.</i></b> The <i>Kingston</i> case deals with a situation in which each of the two causes (i.e. the fires) would easily be considered a but-for cause of the plaintiff’s property loss if the other fire never existed. But because of the two fires, each independent and sufficient to have caused all of the plaintiff’s loss on its own, neither can meet the test. If the court were to insist on traditional but-for causation here the plaintiff could not recover against either tortfeasor, and both tortfeasors would escape judgment. Such a result would frustrate both the purpose of compensation and deterrence. This is a scenario where <i>conceptually</i> the but-for test seems to fail in achieving justice.</p>
<p id="65bed1b9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Other Instances of Multiple Causes.</i></b> In one sense, every tort case involves the confluence of many but-for causes that result in a single, indivisible injury to the plaintiff. If a criminal assault is permitted to occur to a plaintiff in her hotel room because of the hotel’s inadequate security, both the criminal and the hotel would be considered but-for causes of the one loss. The but-for causation test can be satisfied and the plaintiff can recover against either or both. Just because multiple causes exist does not mean that a but-for dilemma will be present—we saw this earlier in the <i>Cay v. Louisiana</i> case. The multiple independent sufficient causes doctrine is only applicable in situations where each tortfeasor’s misconduct, on its own, would lead to the same result and thus neither is actually essential.</p>
<p id="65bed1ba-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Natural Causes.</i></b> Some courts have held, as the <i>Cook</i> court held, that where the second, independently sufficient cause is a natural cause of the plaintiff’s loss, the multiple independent sufficient cause doctrine should not be available. This is because the chief concern cited in <i>Kingston</i>—that the but-for-test might <span title="244" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-244">p. 244</span>otherwise allow two tortfeasors to both escape liability by pointing to one another—is not present. Not all courts agree with this and will apply the doctrine even if the second cause is of natural origins.</p>
<p id="65bed1bb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>An Alternative Analysis.</i></b> After recognizing that the search for essential but-for causation in scenarios involving multiple independent sufficient causes was impossible, courts eventually began asking instead whether the defendant’s role was at least a <i>substantial factor</i> in leading to the claimant’s harm. We will see this employed in such an instance later in this chapter in the case of Brisboy v. Fibreboard Paper Products Corp. Such alternative analysis can be traced back to the language in <i>Kingston</i> when the court wondered about the relative size of the two fires, suggesting that if one were far greater than the other it might diminish the smaller fire being considered substantial enough to create liability. The Restatement (Third) of Torts now suggests skipping this “substantial factor” analysis in cases of multiple independent sufficient causes.</p>
<p id="65bed1bc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. <i>Problem.</i></b> A plaintiff was exposed to a toxic substance, asbestos, from multiple different employers during a long career working at shipyards where asbestos was used for insulation. Plaintiff eventually was diagnosed with a form of cancer caused by asbestos exposure. Will this plaintiff face any difficulty proving causation in a suit against all of the former employers? What additional information would be necessary to determine if the rule from <i>Kingston</i> would apply?</p>

<p id="65bed1bf-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Alternative liability is another doctrine intended to help repair a but-for causation problem in another instance where the but-for test would yield unsavory results. Alternative liability applies in a multiple tortfeasor scenario where there is a true but-for cause associated with the tort but the plaintiff is not in a position to identify, as between the tortfeasors, which one is responsible for causing the harm. <i>Summers</i> is the classic case cited for this doctrine. It involves three hunters in the woods. Plaintiff gets shot but cannot prove which other hunter actually shot him. The two defendants both fired the same type of weapon in plaintiff’s direction. As you read this, notice that although the plaintiff suffers two injuries, as to each injury it is clear that only one of the hunters could have caused the harm. Consider how the <i>nature</i> of the but-for problem is very different here than in cases of multiple independently sufficient causes, and yet the <i>principle</i> motivating the doctrine is virtually identical. The next case, <i>Burke</i>, involves a plaintiff trying to use a causation cure (alternative liability), even though the plaintiff’s real problem has more to do with proving breach of duty. For this reason, the doctrine is unavailing there.</p>

<p id="65bef8d6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Each of the two defendants appeals from a judgment against them in an action for personal injuries. Pursuant to stipulation the appeals have been consolidated.</p>
<p id="65bef8d7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff’s action was against both defendants for an injury to his right eye and face as the result of being struck by bird shot discharged from a shotgun. The case was tried by the court without a jury and the court found that…plaintiff and the two defendants were hunting quail on the open range. Each of the defendants was armed with a 12 gauge shotgun loaded with shells containing 7 ½ size shot. Prior to going hunting plaintiff discussed the hunting procedure with defendants, indicating that they were to exercise care when shooting and to “keep in line.” In the course of hunting plaintiff proceeded up a hill, thus placing the hunters at the points of a triangle. The view of defendants with reference to plaintiff was unobstructed and they knew his location. Defendant Tice flushed a quail which rose in flight to a 10-foot elevation and flew between plaintiff and defendants. Both defendants shot at the quail, shooting in plaintiff’s direction. At that time defendants were 75 yards from plaintiff. One shot struck plaintiff in his eye and another in his upper lip. Finally it was found by the court that as the direct result of the shooting by defendants the shots struck plaintiff as above mentioned and that defendants were negligent in so shooting and plaintiff was not contributorily negligent.</p>
<p id="65bef8d8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, on the subject of negligence, defendant Simonson contends that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the finding on that score, but he does not point out wherein it is lacking. There is evidence that both defendants, at about the same time or one immediately after the other, shot at a quail and in so doing shot toward plaintiff who was uphill from them, and that they knew his location. That is sufficient from which the trial court could conclude that they acted with respect to plaintiff other than as persons of ordinary prudence. The issue was one of fact for the trial court.</p>
<p id="65bef8d9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The problem presented in this case is whether the judgment against both defendants may stand. It is argued by defendants that…there is not sufficient evidence to show which defendant was guilty of the negligence which caused the injuries—the shooting by Tice or that by Simonson.</p>
<p id="65bef8da-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[W]e believe it is clear that the court sufficiently found on the issue that defendants were jointly liable and that thus the negligence of both was the cause of the injury or to that legal effect. It found that both defendants were negligent and “That as a direct and proximate result of the shots fired by <i>defendants, and each of them</i>, a birdshot pellet was caused to and did lodge in plaintiff’s right eye and that another birdshot pellet was caused to and did lodge in plaintiff’s upper lip.” In so doing the court evidently did not give credence to the admissions of Simonson to third persons that he fired the shots, which it was justified in <span title="246" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-246">p. 246</span>doing. It thus determined that the negligence of both defendants was the legal cause of the injury—or that both were responsible. Implicit in such finding is the assumption that the court was unable to ascertain whether the shots were from the gun of one defendant or the other or one shot from each of them. The one shot that entered plaintiff’s eye was the major factor in assessing damages and that shot could not have come from the gun of both defendants. It was from one or the other only.</p>
<p id="65bef8db-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It has been held that where a group of persons are on a hunting party, or otherwise engaged in the use of firearms, and two of them are negligent in firing in the direction of a third person who is injured thereby, both of those so firing are liable for the injury suffered by the third person, although the negligence of only one of them could have caused the injury. The same rule has been applied in criminal cases, and both drivers have been held liable for the negligence of one where they engaged in a racing contest causing an injury to a third person. These cases speak of the action of defendants as being in concert as the ground of decision, yet it would seem they are straining that concept and the more reasonable basis appears in <i>Oliver v. Miles, supra.</i> There two persons were hunting together. Both shot at some partridges and in so doing shot across the highway injuring plaintiff who was travelling on it. The court stated they were acting in concert and thus both were liable. The court then stated: “We think that…each is liable for the resulting injury to the boy, although no one can say definitely who actually shot him. <i>To hold otherwise would be to exonerate both from liability, although each was negligent, and the injury resulted from such negligence</i>.” Dean Wigmore has this to say: “When two or more persons by their acts are possibly the sole cause of a harm, or when two or more acts of the same person are possibly the sole cause, and the plaintiff has introduced evidence that the one of the two persons, or the one of the same person’s two acts, is culpable, then the defendant has the burden of proving that the other person, or his other act, was the sole cause of the harm.…The real reason for the rule that each joint tortfeasor is responsible for the whole damage is the practical unfairness of denying the injured person redress simply because he cannot prove how much damage each did, when it is certain that between them they did all; let them be the ones to apportion it among themselves. Since, then, the difficulty of proof is the reason, the rule should apply whenever the harm has plural causes, and not merely when they acted in conscious concert.…” (Wigmore, Select Cases on the Law of Torts, §153.)</p>
<p id="65bef8dc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When we consider the relative position of the parties and the results that would flow if plaintiff was required to pin the injury on one of the defendants only, a requirement that the burden of proof on that subject be shifted to defendants becomes manifest. They are both wrongdoers—both negligent toward plaintiff. They brought about a situation where the negligence of one of them injured the plaintiff, hence it should rest with them each to absolve himself if he can. The injured party has been placed by defendants in the unfair position of pointing to which defendant caused the harm. If one can escape the other may also and plaintiff is remediless. Ordinarily defendants are in a far better position <span title="247" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-247">p. 247</span>to offer evidence to determine which one caused the injury. This reasoning has recently found favor in this court.</p>
<p id="65bef8dd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to that, however, it should be pointed out that the same reasons of policy and justice shift the burden to each of defendants to absolve himself if he can—relieving the wronged person of the duty of apportioning the injury to a particular defendant, apply here where we are concerned with whether plaintiff is required to supply evidence for the apportionment of damages. If defendants are independent tortfeasors and thus each liable for the damage caused by him alone, and, at least, where the matter of apportionment is incapable of proof, the innocent wronged party should not be deprived of his right to redress. The wrongdoers should be left to work out between themselves any apportionment.</p>

<p id="65bf1ff1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Nature of Problem.</i></b> In the instance of multiple independent sufficient causes, there is a conceptual impossibility of proving but-for causation since neither of the tortfeasors’ actions is essential. How is the but-for problem different with alternative liability, as set forth in <i>Summers</i>? In alternative liability scenarios, is there a but-for cause? If so, then why do courts not insist upon placing the ordinary burden of proving this element of the cause of action? Consider that we know for sure that one of the hunters shot the plaintiff in the eye. As to that defendant, but-for causation would be easy if we could identify the source of the shot that hit the eye. But this <i>evidentiary problem</i>, through no fault of the plaintiff, would insulate both defendants from liability. Absent this doctrine, how could the plaintiff prove causation by a preponderance of the evidence? As to either defendant, what are the statistical chances that the defendant was in fact the one who shot the plaintiff? Can you say that either hunter is <i>probably</i> responsible? If not, what becomes of the plaintiff’s entire case?</p>
<p id="65bf1ff2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Concert of Action Distinguished.</i></b> In <i>Summers</i>, the court briefly considers (and rejects) an alternative way around the causation problem—utilization of the <i>concert of action</i> doctrine. This is the civil world’s corollary to criminal law’s conspiracy theory. We will explore that doctrine further in Chapter 9 Apportionment.</p>
<p id="65bf1ff3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Problem.</i></b> You may recall the case <i>Boy Scouts of America</i> from the section on consent to intentional torts. The plaintiff minor sued two other boys for shooting him in one eye with one paper clip, even though each of the boys had been playing the game separately. Assuming the plaintiff had not consented to the battery, would he have been able to demonstrate but-for causation against either of the other boys? Would the doctrine of alternative liability be applicable to assist?</p>

<p id="65bf470a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On October 4, 1994, Gary Burke and his wife, Tammy Burke, filed a complaint in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, naming Kerri Schaffner as the lone defendant. The lawsuit arose as a result of serious injuries sustained by Gary Burke on October 26, 1993, when he was struck by a pickup truck driven by Martin Malone, with whom the Burkes settled prior to commencing litigation. The incident occurred during a party held for officers of the City of Columbus Division of Police, 8th Precinct.</p>
<div class="epub-feature epub-feature1 cc-feature-sidebar epub-feature-sidebar epub-sidebar-right">
<div class="epub-feature-heading2 cc-font-medium epub-text-left"><p id="65bf470c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-left">In Practice</p></div>
<p id="65bf470d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Given the evidentiary nature of the problem in an alternative liability scenario, the doctrine provides for an evidentiary response—it shifts the burden of proof to the defendants to negate but-for causation. If one of the defendants is successful in doing so, they have in effect solved the plaintiff’s riddle. Persuasive exonerating proof as to one hunter in the woods provides evidentiary support for establishing but-for causation as to the other hunter. By contrast, the doctrine of multiple independent sufficient causes does not act to shift the burden of proof because that doctrine solves a conceptual problem with but-for causation. In this way, the nature of the problem defines the nature of the doctrinal remedy.</p>
</div>
<p id="65bf470e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no dispute between the parties that the pickup truck accelerated suddenly, causing Mr. Burke to be pinned between it and a parked car. The Burkes’ complaint alleged that Ms. Schaffner, who was seated directly beside the driver, negligently stepped on the accelerator as she moved over on the front seat to make room for two other passengers getting into the truck.</p>
<p id="65bf470f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prior to trial, counsel for Ms. Schaffner filed a motion for summary judgment. Appended to the motion was an affidavit in which she stated, “at no time while I was in the vehicle did my foot hit the accelerator.…” In their memorandum contra, the Burkes relied upon deposition testimony of Mr. Malone, which included his denial of fault and resulting conclusion that Ms. Schaffner must have stepped on the accelerator. In a decision rendered August 24, 1995, the trial court denied the motion, holding that there existed a genuine issue of material fact as to who hit the accelerator.</p>
<p id="65bf4710-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case proceeded to a trial by jury on March 11, 1996. Essentially, plaintiffs’ theory, based in large part upon the testimony of Mr. Malone, was that Ms. Schaffner stepped on the accelerator. To the evident surprise of plaintiffs’ counsel, the defense rested without calling any witnesses, including Ms. Schaffner herself. Plaintiffs’ counsel unsuccessfully attempted to reopen their case or, alternatively, to call the defendant as a “rebuttal” witness.</p>
<p id="65bf4711-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On March 14, 1996, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Ms. Schaffner. The jury’s response to an interrogatory submitted with the verdict forms indicated the jury’s express finding that Ms. Schaffner was not negligent.</p>
<p id="65bf4712-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In their first assignment of error, appellants argue that the trial court erred in failing to grant their motion for a directed verdict. Specifically, appellants <span title="249" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-249">p. 249</span>reason as follows. They “proved” that Ms. Schaffner was one of only two persons who could have negligently harmed Mr. Burke. The only other potentially responsible person, Martin Malone, called by appellants as a witness, testified that he did not step on the accelerator. Thus, since Ms. Schaffner failed to present any evidence to overcome her burden to demonstrate that she did not cause the harm, appellants should have been granted a directed verdict.</p>
<p id="65bf4713-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addressing this specific contention, appellants necessarily incorporate issues pertaining to the doctrine of alternative liability, the subject of their second assignment of error. Thus, we address these arguments jointly.</p>
<p id="65bf4714-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants’ argument relies heavily upon the testimony of Martin Malone, who, as indicated above, unequivocally denied stepping on the accelerator. Appellants contend that the doctrine of alternative liability mandates a finding that since Ms. Schaffner did not testify or otherwise present evidence, she failed to satisfy her burden to prove that she was <i>not</i> negligent. Appellees counter, and the trial court so held, that the doctrine of alternative liability is not applicable to this case.</p>
<p id="65bf4715-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The doctrine of alternative liability was adopted by a narrow majority of the Supreme Court of Ohio in <i>Minnich v. Ashland Oil Co.</i> (1984), 473 N.E.2d 1199, at the syllabus:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65bf4716-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Where the conduct of two or more actors is tortious</i>, and it is proved that harm has been caused to the plaintiff by only one of them, but there is uncertainty as to which one has caused it, the burden is upon each such actor to prove that he has not caused the harm. (2 <i>Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts, Section 433</i>[<i>B</i>][<i>3</i>], adopted.) (Emphasis added.)</p>
</div>
<p id="65bf4717-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, the trial court found alternative liability (and thus, burden-shifting) to be inappropriate based upon a narrow interpretation of <i>Minnich</i>, limiting its application to cases involving multiple defendants, <i>each</i> of whom acted tortiously. The trial court rejected the doctrine based upon appellants’ theory that <i>only one</i> of two persons stepped on the accelerator either the named defendant, Kerri Schaffner, or Martin Malone, the latter of whom denied fault.</p>
<p id="65bf6e28-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants acknowledge the current status of the doctrine in Ohio, citing pertinent case law; however, they construe the case law in a manner which broadens the scope of the doctrine to include situations involving a single negligent act committed by one potentially unidentifiable person, regardless of that person’s status as a party or non-party. The trial court rejected this expansion of the doctrine.</p>
<p id="65bf6e29-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We too reject such a broad interpretation. We agree with the holding of the trial court and find its reasoning to be sound. Plain language in <i>Minnich</i> lends support to this narrow interpretation:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65bf6e2a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It should be emphasized that under this alternative liability theory, plaintiff must still prove: (1) that <i>two or more defendants committed tortious acts</i>, and (2) that plaintiff was injured as a proximate result of the wrongdoing of one of the <span title="250" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-250">p. 250</span>defendants.

<p id="65bf954e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Prerequisites for Doctrine.</i></b> The court in <i>Burke</i> identifies several fundamental criteria for application of the alternative liability doctrine. These include that (a) there be more than one tortfeasor, (b) all tortfeasors are engaged in similar conduct, (c) plaintiff was injured as a result of the actions of one of the tortfeasors, and (d) plaintiff name all of the tortfeasors to the action. When this doctrine applies, it acts as a burden-shifting device, which presumes that all defendants caused the plaintiff’s harm unless and until one of them proves otherwise. Given these requirements, what was wrong with plaintiff’s attempt in <i>Burke</i> to rely upon the doctrine? Was the doctrine designed to fix the true problem that the plaintiff faced?</p>

<p id="65bf954f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Knowing When to Apply Doctrines.</i></b> Ultimately, the <i>Burke</i> case demonstrates the importance of understanding the theory behind tort doctrines to know when they actually apply. Alternative liability applies when the plaintiff can prove that the few defendants brought before the court are tortfeasors and that either of them could have been the actual cause, but that it is impossible to prove which one. In <i>Burke</i>, plaintiff failed to win because plaintiff could not prove that the defendant passenger had stepped on the accelerator. This is the proof necessary to show that the defendant committed an act of negligence. It was a breach failure of proof. Had the plaintiff demonstrated that the defendant had carelessly stepped on the accelerator, the plaintiff would not have had any problems proving causation. Viewed this way, the case shows a plaintiff attempting to fix a breach problem with a causation cure. In a larger sense, the lesson here is to know in what context, and for what reasons, particular tort doctrines apply. This will be enormously useful to you not only on your final exam but also in the practice of law. Ignorance as to the rationale behind the alternative liability rule, and when it applies, may have led the plaintiff’s lawyer in <i>Burke</i> to rest plaintiff’s case without calling the defendant as an adverse witness, on the assumption that the burden of proof had shifted to the defendant.</p>

<p id="65bfbc66-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">When a defective product hurts a plaintiff, proving actual causation might not be too complicated. But what if there are multiple unrelated manufacturers of the same identical product and the plaintiff cannot tell whose product was the source of the injury? In these instances, alternative liability might be unavailing for various reasons, including that the plaintiff might be unable to bring all of the manufacturers into court. Further, even if the plaintiff could locate and serve complaints on every potential source of the product, is it fair to apply alternative liability? After all, when there are only two tortfeasing hunters in the woods, the odds that either is the culprit are relatively high. When the plaintiff proves that both shot in his direction, there is a 50/50 chance as to either defendant that they were the actual cause. Application of a doctrine that makes both fully liable does not seem out of the question. But when there are hundreds of <span title="253" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-253">p. 253</span>manufacturers of a defective, fungible product, is the half of one percent chance that Company X is the source of the product that caused the harm a sufficiently fair basis to make them liable for 100 percent of the plaintiff’s damages? In such instances, where a prevailing doctrine does not quite fit, courts will sometimes create a new doctrinal fix for the problem. The <i>Sindell</i> case below is an example of just such a phenomenon. Pay careful attention to why existing tort theories could not help the plaintiff prove actual causation and how the new doctrine—<i>modified alternative liability</i> (or <i>market share liability</i>)—is uniquely shaped to seek justice that would otherwise be unavailing.</p>

<p id="65bfe37e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff Judith Sindell brought an action against eleven drug companies and Does 1 through 100, on behalf of herself and other women similarly situated.</p>
<p id="65bfe37f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[In her complaint, Sindell alleged that the defendants manufactured, marketed, and sold a synthetic compound of the female hormone estrogen called “DES” from 1941 until 1971. There were hundreds of manufacturers who sold the identical formulation of DES during this time period. The FDA approved DES as a miscarriage preventative but only on an experimental basis with a requirement for certain warnings to that effect. In 1971, the FDA ordered all manufacturers to discontinue marketing and selling the product for preventing miscarriages and to warn physicians and the public of its ill effects. The FDA had determined that DES caused the female offspring of mothers who ingested the drug to suffer certain forms of cervical and vaginal cancer, often one or two decades after their birth. Plaintiff named ten specific manufacturers and alleged that other John Doe companies marketed the DES even though they knew or should have known that it was a carcinogenic substance. She also alleged that they failed to adequately test the drug and failed to comply with FDA restrictions regarding DES. Plaintiff alleges that she, and other similarly situated women, were exposed to DES before their birth, but failed to have any reason to suspect any ill effects from their exposure until many years later. Plaintiff brought this suit within one year of discovering that her illness was possibly linked to DES consumption by her mother. Plaintiff suffered a malignant bladder tumor which had to be surgically removed. She now requires regular medical monitoring for a possible recurrence.]</p>

Plaintiff appeals from this dismissal.]</p>
<p id="65bfe382-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case is but one of a number filed throughout the country seeking to hold drug manufacturers liable for injuries allegedly resulting from DES prescribed to the plaintiffs’ mothers since 1947. According to a note in the Fordham Law Review, estimates of the number of women who took the drug during pregnancy range from 1 ½ million to 3 million. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of the daughters of these women suffer from adenocarcinoma, and the incidence of vaginal adenosis among them is 30 to 90 percent. Most of the cases are still pending. With two exceptions, those that have been decided resulted in judgments in favor of the drug company defendants because of the failure of the plaintiffs to identify the manufacturer of the DES prescribed to their mothers. The present action is another attempt to overcome this obstacle to recovery.</p>
<p id="65bfe383-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We begin with the proposition that, as a general rule, the imposition of liability depends upon a showing by the plaintiff that his or her injuries were caused by the act of the defendant or by an instrumentality under the defendant’s control. The rule applies whether the injury resulted from an accidental event or from the use of a defective product.</p>
<p id="65c00a94-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are, however, exceptions to this rule. Plaintiff’s complaint suggests several bases upon which defendants may be held liable for her injuries even though she cannot demonstrate the name of the manufacturer which produced the DES actually taken by her mother. The first of these theories, classically illustrated by <i>Summers v. Tice</i>, places the burden of proof of causation upon tortious defendants in certain circumstances. The second basis of liability emerging from the complaint is that defendants acted in concert to cause injury to plaintiff.…We shall conclude that these doctrines, as previously interpreted, may not be applied to hold defendants liable under the allegations of this complaint. However, we shall propose and adopt a [different] basis for permitting the action to be tried, grounded upon an extension of the <i>Summers</i> doctrine.</p>
<p id="65c00a95-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff places primary reliance upon cases which hold that if a party cannot identify which of two or more defendants caused an injury, the burden of proof may shift to the defendants to show that they were not responsible for the harm. This principle is sometimes referred to as the “alternative liability” theory.</p>
<p id="65c00a96-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The celebrated case of <i>Summers v. Tice, supra,</i> 33 Cal. 2d 80, a unanimous opinion of this court, best exemplifies the rule. In <i>Summers</i>, the plaintiff was injured when two hunters negligently shot in his direction. It could not be determined which of them had fired the shot that actually caused the injury to the <span title="255" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-255">p. 255</span>plaintiff’s eye, but both defendants were nevertheless held jointly and severally liable for the whole of the damages. We reasoned that both were wrongdoers, both were negligent toward the plaintiff, and that it would be unfair to require plaintiff to isolate the defendant responsible, because if the one pointed out were to escape liability, the other might also, and the plaintiff-victim would be shorn of any remedy. In these circumstances, we held, the burden of proof shifted to the defendants, “each to absolve himself if he can.” We stated that under these or similar circumstances a defendant is ordinarily in a “far better position” to offer evidence to determine whether he or another defendant caused the injury.…</p>
<p id="65c00a97-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants assert that these principles are inapplicable here. First, they insist that a predicate to shifting the burden of proof under <i>Summers</i> is that the defendants must have greater access to information regarding the cause of the injuries than the plaintiff, whereas in the present case the reverse appears.</p>
<p id="65c00a98-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff does not claim that defendants are in a better position than she to identify the manufacturer of the drug taken by her mother or, indeed, that they have the ability to do so at all, but argues, rather, that <i>Summers</i> does not impose such a requirement as a condition to the shifting of the burden of proof. In this respect we believe plaintiff is correct.</p>
<p id="65c00a99-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Summers</i>, the circumstances of the accident themselves precluded an explanation of its cause. To be sure, <i>Summers</i> states that defendants are “[ordinarily]…in a far better position to offer evidence to determine which one caused the injury” than a plaintiff, but the decision does not determine that this “ordinary” situation was present. Neither the facts nor the language of the opinion indicate that the two defendants, simultaneously shooting in the same direction, were in a better position than the plaintiff to ascertain whose shot caused the injury. As the opinion acknowledges, it was impossible for the trial court to determine whether the shot which entered the plaintiff’s eye came from the gun of one defendant or the other. Nevertheless, burden of proof was shifted to the defendants.</p>
<p id="65c00a9a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, as in <i>Summers</i>, the circumstances of the injury appear to render identification of the manufacturer of the drug ingested by plaintiff’s mother impossible by either plaintiff or defendants, and it cannot reasonably be said that one is in a better position than the other to make the identification. Because many years elapsed between the time the drug was taken and the manifestation of plaintiff’s injuries she, and many other daughters of mothers who took DES, are unable to make such identification. Certainly there can be no implication that plaintiff is at fault in failing to do so—the event occurred while plaintiff was <i>in utero</i>, a generation ago.</p>
<p id="65c031ab-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, it cannot be said with assurance that defendants have the means to make the identification. In this connection, they point out that drug manufacturers ordinarily have no direct contact with the patients who take a drug prescribed by their doctors. Defendants sell to wholesalers, who in turn supply the product to physicians and pharmacies. Manufacturers do not maintain records of the persons who take the drugs they produce, and the selection <span title="256" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-256">p. 256</span>of the medication is made by the physician rather than the manufacturer. Nor do we conclude that the absence of evidence on this subject is due to the fault of defendants. While it is alleged that they produced a defective product with delayed effects and without adequate warnings, the difficulty or impossibility of identification results primarily from the passage of time rather than from their allegedly negligent acts of failing to provide adequate warnings.</p>
<p id="65c031ac-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is important to observe, however, that while defendants do not have means superior to plaintiff to identify the maker of the precise drug taken by her mother, they may in some instances be able to prove that they did not manufacture the injury-causing substance. In the present case, for example, one of the original defendants was dismissed from the action upon proof that it did not manufacture DES until after plaintiff was born.</p>
<p id="65c031ad-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus we conclude the fact defendants do not have greater access to information that might establish the identity of the manufacturer of the DES which injured plaintiff does not per se prevent application of the <i>Summers</i> rule.</p>
<p id="65c031ae-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nevertheless, plaintiff may not prevail in her claim that the <i>Summers</i> rationale should be employed to fix the whole liability for her injuries upon defendants, at least as those principles have previously been applied. There is an important difference between the situation involved in <i>Summers</i> and the present case. There, all the parties who were or could have been responsible for the harm to the plaintiff were joined as defendants. Here, by contrast, there are approximately 200 drug companies which made DES, any of which might have manufactured the injury-producing drug.</p>
<p id="65c031af-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants maintain that, while in <i>Summers</i> there was a 50 percent chance that one of the two defendants was responsible for the plaintiff’s injuries, here since any one of 200 companies which manufactured DES might have made the product that harmed plaintiff, there is no rational basis upon which to infer that any defendant in this action caused plaintiff’s injuries, nor even a reasonable possibility that they were responsible.</p>
<p id="65c031b0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These arguments are persuasive if we measure the chance that any one of the defendants supplied the injury-causing drug by the number of possible tortfeasors. In such a context, the possibility that any of the five defendants supplied the DES to plaintiff’s mother is so remote that it would be unfair to require each defendant to exonerate itself. There may be a substantial likelihood that none of the five defendants joined in the action made the DES which caused the injury, and that the offending producer not named would escape liability altogether. While we propose, <i>infra</i>, an adaptation of the rule in <i>Summers</i> which will substantially overcome these difficulties, defendants appear to be correct that the rule, as previously applied, cannot relieve plaintiff of the burden of proving the identity of the manufacturer which made the drug causing her injuries.</p>
<p id="65c031b1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second principle upon which plaintiff relies is the so-called “concert of action” theory.…With respect to this doctrine, Prosser states that “those who, in pursuance of a common plan or design to commit a tortious act, actively take part in it, or further it by cooperation or request, or who lend aid or encouragement to the wrongdoer, or ratify and adopt his acts done for their benefit, are <span title="257" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-257">p. 257</span>equally liable with him. Express agreement is not necessary, and all that is required is that there be a tacit understanding.…” (Prosser, Law of Torts (4th ed. 1971) §46, p. 292.)</p>
<p id="65c031b2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our view, [Plaintiff’s] litany of charges is insufficient to allege a cause of action under the rules stated above. The gravamen of the charge of concert is that defendants failed to adequately test the drug or to give sufficient warning of its dangers and that they relied upon the tests performed by one another and took advantage of each others’ promotional and marketing techniques. These allegations do not amount to a charge that there was a tacit understanding or a common plan among defendants to fail to conduct adequate tests or give sufficient warnings, and that they substantially aided and encouraged one another in these omissions.</p>
<p id="65c031b3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The complaint charges also that defendants produced DES from a “common and mutually agreed upon formula,” allowing pharmacists to treat the drug as a “fungible commodity” and to fill prescriptions from whatever brand of DES they had on hand at the time. It is difficult to understand how these allegations can form the basis of a cause of action for wrongful conduct by defendants, acting in concert. The formula for DES is a scientific constant. It is set forth in the United States Pharmacopoeia, and any manufacturer producing that drug must, with exceptions not relevant here, utilize the formula set forth in that compendium.</p>
<p id="65c031b4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What the complaint appears to charge is defendants’ parallel or imitative conduct in that they relied upon each others’ testing and promotion methods. But such conduct describes a common practice in industry: a producer avails himself of the experience and methods of others making the same or similar products. Application of the concept of concert of action to this situation would expand the doctrine far beyond its intended scope and would render virtually any manufacturer liable for the defective products of an entire industry, even if it could be demonstrated that the product which caused the injury was not made by the defendant.</p>
<p id="65c031b5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no allegation here that each defendant knew the other defendants’ conduct was tortious toward plaintiff, and that they assisted and encouraged one another to inadequately test DES and to provide inadequate warnings. Indeed, it seems dubious whether liability on the concert of action theory can be predicated upon substantial assistance and encouragement given by one alleged tortfeasor to another pursuant to a tacit understanding to fail to perform an act. Thus, there was no concert of action among defendants within the meaning of that doctrine.</p>
<p id="65c031b6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If we were confined to the [theory of <i>Summers</i>], we would be constrained to hold that the judgment must be sustained. Should we require that plaintiff identify the manufacturer which supplied the DES used by her mother or that all DES manufacturers be joined in the action, she would effectively be precluded from any recovery. As defendants candidly admit, there is little likelihood that all the manufacturers who made DES at the time in question are still in business or that they are subject to the jurisdiction of the California courts. There are, <span title="258" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-258">p. 258</span>however, forceful arguments in favor of holding that plaintiff has a cause of action.</p>
<p id="65c031b7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our contemporary complex industrialized society, advances in science and technology create fungible goods which may harm consumers and which cannot be traced to any specific producer. The response of the courts can be either to adhere rigidly to prior doctrine, denying recovery to those injured by such products, or to fashion remedies to meet these changing needs.</p>
<p id="65c031b8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The most persuasive reason for finding plaintiff states a cause of action is that advanced in <i>Summers</i>: as between an innocent plaintiff and negligent defendants, the latter should bear the cost of the injury. Here, as in <i>Summers</i>, plaintiff is not at fault in failing to provide evidence of causation, and although the absence of such evidence is not attributable to the defendants either, their conduct in marketing a drug the effects of which are delayed for many years played a significant role in creating the unavailability of proof.</p>
<p id="65c058c9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where, as here, all defendants produced a drug from an identical formula and the manufacturer of the DES which caused plaintiff’s injuries cannot be identified through no fault of plaintiff, a modification of the rule of <i>Summers</i> is warranted. As we have seen, an undiluted <i>Summers</i> rationale is inappropriate to shift the burden of proof of causation to defendants because if we measure the chance that any particular manufacturer supplied the injury-causing product by the number of producers of DES, there is a possibility that none of the five defendants in this case produced the offending substance and that the responsible manufacturer, not named in the action, will escape liability.</p>
<p id="65c058ca-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But we approach the issue of causation from a different perspective: we hold it to be reasonable in the present context to measure the likelihood that any of the defendants supplied the product which allegedly injured plaintiff by the percentage which the DES sold by each of them for the purpose of preventing miscarriage bears to the entire production of the drug sold by all for that purpose. Plaintiff asserts in her briefs that Eli Lilly and Company and five or six other companies produced 90 percent of the DES marketed. If at trial this is established to be the fact, then there is a corresponding likelihood that this comparative handful of producers manufactured the DES which caused plaintiff’s injuries, and only a 10 percent likelihood that the offending producer would escape liability.</p>
<p id="65c058cb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If plaintiff joins in the action the manufacturers of a substantial share of the DES which her mother might have taken, the injustice of shifting the burden of proof to defendants to demonstrate that they could not have made the substance which injured plaintiff is significantly diminished. While 75 to 80 percent of the market [has been suggested by some proponents of this new theory of liability] we hold only that a substantial percentage is required.</p>
<p id="65c058cc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The presence in the action of a substantial share of the appropriate market also provides a ready means to apportion damages among the defendants. Each defendant will be held liable for the proportion of the judgment represented by its share of that market unless it demonstrates that it could <span title="259" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-259">p. 259</span>not have made the product which caused plaintiff’s injuries. In the present case, as we have seen, one DES manufacturer was dismissed from the action upon filing a declaration that it had not manufactured DES until after plaintiff was born. Once plaintiff has met her burden of joining the required defendants, they in turn may cross-complain against other DES manufacturers, not joined in the action, which they can allege might have supplied the injury-causing product.</p>
<p id="65c058cd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under this approach, each manufacturer’s liability would approximate its responsibility for the injuries caused by its own products. It is probably impossible, with the passage of time, to determine market share with mathematical exactitude. But…the difficulty of apportioning damages among the defendant producers in exact relation to their market share does not seriously militate against the rule we adopt. As we said in <i>Summers</i> with regard to the liability of independent tortfeasors, where a correct division of liability cannot be made “the trier of fact may make it the best it can.” (33 Cal. 2d at p. 88.)</p>
<p id="65c058ce-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are not unmindful of the practical problems involved in defining the market and determining market share, but these are largely matters of proof which properly cannot be determined at the pleading stage of these proceedings. Defendants urge that it would be both unfair and contrary to public policy to hold them liable for plaintiff’s injuries in the absence of proof that one of them supplied the drug responsible for the damage. Most of their arguments, however, are based upon the assumption that one manufacturer would be held responsible for the products of another or for those of all other manufacturers if plaintiff ultimately prevails. But under the rule we adopt, each manufacturer’s liability for an injury would be approximately equivalent to the damage caused by the DES it manufactured.</p>

<p id="65c058d1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Modifications to Alternative Liability.</i></b> What prerequisites for application of the doctrine of alternative liability were missing in <i>Sindell</i>? The court alludes to several failings. For one thing, not all of the potential sources of the defective product were before the court. Remember that alternative liability operates to shift the burden of proof to the defendants to come forward with evidence negating causation as to them. In the absence of such proof, all tortfeasing defendants are liable. Alternative liability’s operation does not work without all sources present in the courtroom. Second, there are simply too many potential sources of the problem to make application of the doctrine fair to any one defendant. Given these shortcomings, the California Supreme Court opined that the application of that doctrine to fix the but-for causation problem of the plaintiffs would be unfair. Ultimately the court adopts a variation of alternative liability, often called <i>market share liability</i>. How is this different from alternative liability, in terms of its prerequisites and its effects on any defendant’s liability? <span title="260" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-260">p. 260</span>This can be answered by reference to the problems mentioned above with regard to applying alternative liability. For one thing, the court loosens the burden of bringing all tortfeasors before the court. If the plaintiff instead brings before the court defendants constituting a substantial share of the market for the product, this will be considered sufficient. At least in this instance there is a probability that the correct manufacturer is present. Second, each defendant (that fails to exonerate itself as a cause) is liable only for its percentage share of the market of the product. If a defendant sold 5 percent of the product in the relevant market at the relevant period of time, it would only be liable for 5 percent of the plaintiff’s compensatory damages.</p>
<p id="65c058d2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Statutes of Limitations.</i></b> Plaintiffs in these DES cases, which were filed in abundance after the FDA’s actions in 1971, typically faced significant hurdles both in terms of proving causation—due to their inability to identify the manufacturer of the pills taken by their mothers—and in terms of justifying the late filing of their claims under applicable statutes of limitations. In some states the legislature passed new laws expressly granting DES claimants additional time to pursue their litigation. While many states have now adopted modified alternative liability, in appropriate cases involving fungible goods where product identification is difficult, other states have refused to do so.</p>
<p id="65c058d3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Concert of Action.</i></b> The court also dispenses with plaintiff’s additional argument that but-for causation need not be proven because all of the manufacturers were acting in unison or in concert with one another. Had that theory been applicable to the facts, the court would have treated the defendants as one and this would have mooted the product identification problem. Unfortunately, parallel conduct does not prove two manufacturers are acting in any joint fashion. Concert of action theory is dealt with later in this book in Chapter 9 under the topic of Apportionment.</p>

<p id="65c07fe6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another causation riddle occurs when the plaintiff has been either exposed to some toxic substance, or received some inadequate medical treatment, and this results in the plaintiff being at risk for some <i>future</i> harm. The statute of limitations may compel the plaintiff to bring suit today for a possible injury tomorrow. Further, the civil procedure doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> demands that in any suit a plaintiff seek recovery for all past, present, and future damages at once. But what if the plaintiff is less than 50 percent likely to actually experience the anticipated future ill effects of the exposure or treatment? Will the court stick with the traditional demand for proving causation by a preponderance of the evidence, and only permit recovery for likely future effects, or will the court permit the plaintiff to recover on some other novel theory? The case that follows shows one plaintiff’s effort to suggest a pathway around this causation problem.</p>

<p id="65c07fed-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The sole issue in this case is whether a person who has been exposed to asbestos but does not have an asbestos-related disease may recover damages for fear of the possibility of developing such a disease in the future. The district court granted summary judgment for the defendant on plaintiff’s claims for actual and punitive damages. A divided court of appeals reversed only on the actual damages claim. For reasons we explain, the district court was correct.</p>
<p id="65c07fee-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Temple-Inland Forest Products Corporation employed Biskamp Electric to install electric outlets and computer jacks in a laboratory at one of its paper mills. In performing the installation, two Biskamp employees, Martin Reeves Carter Sr. and Larry Wilson, drilled holes in laboratory countertops, which they did not know and were not told contained asbestos. The drilling generated dust containing asbestos fibers to which Carter and Wilson were exposed. They had no protective gear to prevent them from inhaling the dust. Carter worked on the project from four to six weeks, and Wilson worked on it about two weeks. Not until the work was almost complete did the laboratory manager warn Carter and Wilson of the asbestos, at which point they stopped work on the project. Temple-Inland then tested and decontaminated the lab.</p>
<p id="65c07fef-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some eighteen months later Carter and Wilson were examined by Dr. Daniel Jenkins, to whom they had been referred by their attorney. Although Dr. Jenkins concluded that neither Carter nor Wilson had any asbestos-related disease, they sued Temple-Inland for mental anguish damages caused by its having negligently exposed them to asbestos fibers.</p>
<p id="65c07ff0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dr. Jenkins testified at his deposition that…Wilson and Carter suffered from no disease as a result of their exposure to asbestos.…Dr. Jenkins, however, insisted that Wilson and Carter had been injured by their exposure to asbestos and probable inhalation of asbestos fibers at the Temple-Inland lab. He estimated that the chances of their developing a disease as a result had increased from one in a million, which he estimated to be the risk that a person would ever develop a disease from asbestos exposure not occupationally related, to about one in 500,000 for the next ten or fifteen years, and as much as one in 100 over twenty or thirty years. Dr. Jenkins characterized plaintiffs’ risk as a “high possibility” but not a probability.</p>
<p id="65c07ff1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Based on the depositions of Dr. Jenkins, Carter, Wilson, and others, Temple-Inland moved for summary judgment on the ground that Carter and Wilson had not suffered any injury for which they could recover mental anguish damages. Temple-Inland argued that plaintiffs’ claims for fear of the mere possibility of developing some disease in the future amounted to nothing more than negligent infliction of emotional distress for which they could not recover under this Court’s decision in <i>Boyles v. Kerr</i> [p. 356]. Plaintiffs responded that their <span title="262" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-262">p. 262</span>inhalation of asbestos fibers was a real, physical injury which could eventually lead to disease, and that they were entitled to be compensated for their anxiety over that eventuality.</p>
<p id="65c0a702-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court granted summary judgment. The court of appeals…reversed the judgment on plaintiffs’ actual damage claims. Relying principally on [on some recent federal courts’ opinions] the court concluded that “it is well established a plaintiff may recover for mental anguish based upon fear of cancer even though the evidence shows the plaintiff does not have, and in reasonable medical probability, will not have cancer, so long as there has been exposure to the causative agent and the fear is reasonable.”</p>
<p id="65c0a703-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We granted Temple-Inland’s application for writ of error and now reverse the court of appeals’ judgment insofar as it reversed the district court’s judgment.</p>
<p id="65c0a704-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The summary judgment record establishes that Carter and Wilson were exposed to asbestos at Temple-Inland’s lab but do not presently suffer from any asbestos-related disease, and that while their risk of developing such a disease was increased by their exposure to asbestos, that risk is still no higher than one chance in a hundred over twenty to thirty years. The issue is whether they can recover for their fear that they will someday develop such a disease from their work at Temple-Inland’s lab.</p>
<p id="65c0a705-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Carter and Wilson first argue that they are entitled to recover mental anguish damages even if they sustained no physical injury, as long as their fear of developing some asbestos-related disease is reasonable. This argument conflicts with our decision in <i>Boyles v. Kerr</i>, where we held that “there is no general duty not to negligently inflict emotional distress.” As we later explained in <i>City of Tyler v. Likes</i>, “it has been established for over a century that ‘[a] person who is placed in peril by the negligence of another, but who escapes without injury, may not recover damages simply because he has been placed in a perilous position.…’”</p>
<p id="65c0a706-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Carter and Wilson argue that they have been physically injured because of their exposure to asbestos fibers. Carter’s and Wilson’s testimony, as well as that of Dr. Jenkins, supports the inference that they inhaled asbestos fibers in the lab, and Temple-Inland has not refuted this inference.…The question comes to this: given that plaintiffs inhaled asbestos fibers, can they recover mental anguish damages for their increased risk and reasonable fear of possibly developing asbestos-related diseases that they do not currently have and may never have?</p>
<p id="65c0a707-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While the existence of physical injury is ordinarily <i>necessary</i> for recovery of mental anguish damages…, such injury may not be <i>sufficient</i> for recovery of mental anguish damages when the injury has not produced disease, despite a reasonable fear that such disease will develop.…[L]ike the Supreme Court and courts in most other jurisdictions, we cannot permit recovery of mental anguish damages in cases like this one. In almost all instances involving personal injury, the law allows for the recovery of accompanying mental anguish damages, even if the mental anguish is not itself physically manifested. But if bodily injury is at <span title="263" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-263">p. 263</span>most latent and any eventual consequences uncertain, as when a person’s exposure to asbestos has not produced disease, then the case for recovery of mental anguish damages is much weaker. A person exposed to asbestos can certainly develop serious health problems, but he or she also may not. The difficulty in predicting whether exposure will cause any disease and if so, what disease, and the long latency period characteristic of asbestos-related diseases, make it very difficult for judges and juries to evaluate which exposure claims are serious and which are not. This difficulty in turn makes liability unpredictable, with some claims resulting in significant recovery while virtually indistinguishable claims are denied altogether. Some claimants would inevitably be overcompensated when, in the course of time, it happens that they never develop the disease they feared, and others would be undercompensated when it turns out that they developed a disease more serious even than they feared. Also, claims for exposure could proliferate because in our society, as the Supreme Court observed, “contacts, even extensive contacts, with serious carcinogens are common.” Indeed, most Americans are daily subjected to toxic substances in the air they breathe and the food they eat. Suits for mental anguish damages caused by exposure that has not resulted in disease would compete with suits for manifest diseases for the legal system’s limited resources. If recovery were allowed in the absence of present disease, individuals might feel obliged to bring suit for such recovery prophylactically, against the possibility of future consequences from what is now an inchoate risk. This would exacerbate not only the multiplicity of suits but the unpredictability of results.</p>
<p id="65c0a708-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question is not, of course, whether Carter and Wilson have themselves suffered genuine distress over their own exposure. We assume they have, and that their anxiety is reasonable. The question, rather, is whether this <i>type</i> of claim—for fear of an increased risk of developing an asbestos-related disease when no disease is presently manifest—should be permitted, regardless of any individual plaintiff’s circumstances, when the effort in determining the genuineness of each claim and assuring appropriate recovery is beset with the difficulties we have described. We conclude that no such action should be recognized.</p>

<p id="65c0a70b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Increased Risk as a But-For Problem.</i></b> The plaintiffs alleged that their exposure to asbestos placed them at an increased risk of future medical illness even though they had no present condition. Taking into account the normal burden of proof in a civil case—proving each element by a preponderance of the evidence—how does this case demonstrate a but-for causation problem? Note that this problem does not exist with regard to all cases of future harms. When a motorist’s leg is mutilated in a car accident, it may be very likely that she will suffer future pain and suffering the rest of her life. So long as the future damages are likely (more than 50% chance) to occur, she can recover those damages in her trial. The plaintiffs in the foregoing case could not prove the <span title="264" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-264">p. 264</span>likelihood of such future injury. How does their redefining the injury—from cancer to the fear of cancer—attempt to circumvent the normal proof of causation? The majority of other courts to address the unlikely prospect of future harm similarly reject such claims. For example, in Potter v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 863 P.2d 795 (Cal. 1993), the plaintiffs complained of the defendant dumping toxic industrial waste nearby and increasing the plaintiffs’ risk of cancer. Because the plaintiffs could not prove that they probably would suffer such harm from the exposure, the California Supreme Court rejected their claims:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65c0a70c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We cannot say that it would never be reasonable for a person who has ingested toxic substances to harbor a genuine and serious fear of cancer where reliable medical or scientific opinion indicates that such ingestion has significantly increased his or her risk of cancer, but not to a probable likelihood. Nonetheless, we conclude, for…public policy reasons…that emotional distress caused by the fear of a cancer that is not probable should generally not be compensable in a negligence action. 863 P.2d at 811.</p>
</div>
<p id="65c0a70d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Alternative No-Duty Rationale.</i></b> In <i>Temple-Inland</i>, the court holds the plaintiffs to the normal rules of proving but-for causation by a preponderance of the evidence. This is the same requirement that would be applied to any future damages—lost future wages arising from a present injury, for example. With regard to the plaintiffs’ attempt to evade this causation rule by re-casting the damage as one for fear, rather than for cancer, the court also cites another legal proposition—that there is no legal duty to exercise care in preventing others from experiencing emotional distress. This no-duty rule is covered in Chapter 6, Special Duty Rules when we revisit the duty element of a negligence claim.</p>
<p id="65c0a70e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Minority Rule.</i></b> Departing from the majority of courts, which refuse to recognize recovery for a future medical problem that is unlikely to occur, a minority of courts will recognize a right to recover. The amount of recovery in such instances is calculated by taking the total amount of damages, if they were to occur, and multiplying this dollar amount by the present percentage chance of ever experiencing such harm. In <i>Temple-Inland</i>, the Texas Supreme Court suggests that this alternative will always result in either overcompensating plaintiffs or undercompensating plaintiffs, but will never achieve the right level of justice. How is this true?</p>
<p id="65c0a70f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Problem.</i></b> A plaintiff underwent surgery that was not done correctly. As a consequence of this malpractice, the plaintiff had to undergo a second surgical procedure to attempt to correct the first mistake. Plaintiff learned that, as a result of having to undergo the second procedure, he was placed at risk of an 8 to 16 percent chance of having a bowel obstruction in the future. To what extent can this plaintiff demonstrate but-for causation of any harm under the traditional proof requirements?</p>

<p id="65c0cd22-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a related circumstance unique to medical malpractice claims, courts have been even more sympathetic with the plight of plaintiffs who have suffered harm and accused the medical doctor of wrongfully denying them a chance for a cure. The <i>loss of chance</i> doctrine is applied by a majority of courts to permit a medical malpractice plaintiff to recover against a doctor who has failed to make a timely diagnosis or to treat an existing physical condition. The causation problem arises in cases where even the timely treatment of the condition would likely not change the bad outcome. For example, if a deadly cancer can only be cured 5 percent of the time, even with proper diagnosis and care, has the plaintiff been injured when the doctor’s negligence deprives the plaintiff of the attempted cure? In the following case, the court adopts the majority rule of <i>loss of chance</i> to help provide some recovery in this instance. As you read this, consider why the majority of courts are more sympathetic with the plaintiff’s plight in this scenario than in the related circumstance in the preceding section.</p>

<p id="65c0cd2a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff suffered a broken neck in an automobile accident on July 22, 1996, and was treated at the Lakes Region General Hospital by the defendants. She contends that because the defendants negligently misdiagnosed her spinal cord injury, they failed both to immobilize her properly and to administer steroid therapy, causing her to lose the opportunity for a substantially better recovery. She alleges that she continues to suffer significant residual paralysis, weakness and sensitivity.</p>
<p id="65c0cd2b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Upon learning that the defendants intended to move to dismiss at the close of the plaintiff’s case, the trial court permitted the plaintiff to make a pre-trial offer of proof. She proffered that her expert would testify that the defendants’ negligence deprived her of the opportunity for a substantially better recovery. She conceded, however, that her expert could not quantify the degree to which she was deprived of a better recovery by their negligence.</p>
<p id="65c0cd2c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Following the plaintiff’s offer of proof, the defendants moved to dismiss on two grounds: (1) New Hampshire law does not recognize the loss of opportunity theory of recovery; and (2) the plaintiff failed to set forth sufficient evidence of causation. The trial court dismissed the plaintiff’s action on the basis that her case is “clearly predicated on loss of…opportunity” and that “there’s no such theory permitted in this State.” This appeal followed.</p>

<p id="65c0cd2d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The loss of opportunity doctrine, in its many forms, is a medical malpractice form of recovery which allows a plaintiff, whose preexisting injury or illness is aggravated by the alleged negligence of a physician or health care worker, to recover for her lost opportunity to obtain a better degree of recovery. Generally, courts have taken three approaches to loss of opportunity claims.</p>
<p id="65c0cd2e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first approach, the traditional tort approach, is followed by a minority of courts. According to this approach, a plaintiff must prove that as a result of the defendant’s negligence, the plaintiff was deprived of at least a fifty-one percent chance of a more favorable outcome than she actually received. Once the plaintiff meets this burden, she may recover damages for the entire preexisting illness or condition.</p>
<p id="65c0cd2f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under this approach, a patient whose injury is negligently misdiagnosed, but who would have had only a fifty percent chance of full recovery from her condition with proper diagnosis, could not recover damages because she would be unable to prove that, absent the physician’s negligence, her chance of a better recovery was at least fifty-one percent. If, however, the patient could establish the necessary causal link by establishing that absent the negligence she would have had at least a fifty-one percent chance of a better outcome, not only would the patient be entitled to recover, but she would be awarded damages for her entire injury. This approach has been criticized as yielding an “all or nothing” result.</p>
<p id="65c0cd30-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second approach, a variation of the traditional approach, relaxes the standard of proof of causation. The causation requirement is relaxed by permitting plaintiffs to submit their cases to the jury upon demonstrating that a defendant’s negligence more likely than not “increased the harm” to the plaintiff or “destroyed a substantial possibility” of achieving a more favorable outcome.</p>
<p id="65c0f441-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under this approach, the patient would not be precluded from recovering simply because her chance of a better recovery was less than fifty-one percent, so long as she could prove that the defendant’s negligence increased her harm to some degree. The precise degree required varies by jurisdiction. Some courts require that the defendant’s negligence increase the plaintiff’s harm by any degree, while other courts require that the increase be substantial. As in the traditional approach, once the plaintiff meets her burden, she recovers damages for the entire underlying preexisting condition or illness rather than simply the loss of opportunity. This approach “represents the worst of both worlds [because it] continues the arbitrariness of the all-or-nothing rule, but by relaxing the proof requirements, it increases the likelihood that a plaintiff will be able to convince a jury to award full damages.” King, <i>“Reduction of Likelihood” Reformulation</i>, 28 U. Mem. L. Rev. 491 (1998).</p>
<p id="65c0f442-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the third approach, the lost opportunity for a better outcome is, itself, the injury for which the negligently injured person may recover. As with the second approach, a plaintiff may prevail even if her chances of a better recovery are less than fifty-one percent. The plaintiff, however, does not receive damages for the <i>entire</i> injury, but just for the lost opportunity.</p>
<span title="267" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-267">p. 267</span>
<p id="65c0f443-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In other words, if the plaintiff can establish the causal link between the defendant’s negligence and the lost opportunity, the plaintiff may recover that portion of damages actually attributable to the defendant’s negligence.</p>
<p id="65c0f444-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under this approach, “by defining the injury as the loss of chance…, the traditional rule of preponderance is fully satisfied.” <i>Perez v. Las Vegas Medical Center</i>, 805 P.2d 589, 592 (Nev. 1991).</p>
<p id="65c0f445-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree with the majority of courts rejecting the traditional “all-or-nothing” approach to loss of opportunity cases, and find the third approach most sound. <i>See Delaney</i>, 873 P.2d at 184-86; <i>Perez</i>, 805 P.2d at 591-93. The third approach permits plaintiffs to recover for the loss of an opportunity for a better outcome, an interest that we agree should be compensable, while providing for the proper valuation of such an interest.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65c0f446-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The loss of a chance of achieving a favorable outcome or of avoiding an adverse consequence should be compensable and should be valued appropriately, rather than treated as an all-or-nothing proposition. Preexisting conditions must, of course, be taken into account in valuing the interest destroyed. When those preexisting conditions have not absolutely preordained an adverse outcome, however, the chance of avoiding it should be appropriately compensated even if that chance is not better than even.</p>

<p id="65c0f447-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">King, <i>Causation, Valuation, and Chance in Personal Injury Torts Involving Preexisting Conditions and Future Consequences</i>, 90 Yale L.J. 1353, 1354 (1981).</p>
<p id="65c0f448-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, we hold that a plaintiff may recover for a loss of opportunity injury in medical malpractice cases when the defendant’s alleged negligence aggravates the plaintiff’s preexisting injury such that it deprives the plaintiff of a <i>substantially</i> better outcome. <i>See Delaney</i>, 873 P.2d at 178, 185-86; <i>see also Perez</i>, 805 P.2d at 592.</p>
<p id="65c0f449-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendants imply that the loss of opportunity doctrine is contrary to the burden of proof requirements described in <i>RSA 507-E:2</i> (1997). Specifically, the defendants argue that the loss of opportunity doctrine permits recovery based on the “possibility” that the defendant caused the plaintiff’s injury, whereas <i>RSA 507-E:2</i> requires the plaintiff to establish that the alleged negligence “probably” caused the injury.</p>
<p id="65c0f44a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We disagree that the loss of opportunity doctrine is inconsistent with [the legal requirement of proving each element by a preponderance of the evidence]. By recognizing loss of opportunity as a cognizable injury, we refute the notion that the plaintiff would be unable to prove that the defendants’ negligence “probably” caused her to suffer “injuries which would not otherwise have occurred.” The right we recognize today still requires a plaintiff to prove that the injury she suffered—the lost opportunity for a better outcome—was caused, more probably than not, by the defendant’s negligence.</p>
<p id="65c0f44b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, defendant Lovett argues that we should not recognize the plaintiff’s loss of opportunity injury because it is intangible and, thus, is not amenable to damages calculation. We disagree.</p>
<span title="268" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-268">p. 268</span>
<p id="65c0f44c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, we fail to see the logic in denying an injured plaintiff recovery against a physician for the lost opportunity of a better outcome on the basis that the alleged injury is too difficult to calculate, when the physician’s own conduct has caused the difficulty. <i>See Hicks v. United States</i>, 368 F.2d 626, 632 (4th Cir. 1966). Second, “we have long held that difficulty in calculating damages is not a sufficient reason to deny recovery to an injured party.” <i>Smith v. Cote</i>, 513 A.2d 341 (N.H. 1986). Third, loss of opportunity is not inherently unquantifiable. A loss of opportunity plaintiff must provide the jury with a basis upon which to distinguish that portion of her injury caused by the defendant’s negligence from the portion resulting from the underlying injury. <i>See Valliere v. Filfalt</i>, 266 A.2d 843 (N.H. 1970); King, <i>Causation, Valuation, and Chance</i>, <i>supra</i> at 1360. This can be done through expert testimony just as it is in aggravation of pre-existing injury cases.</p>
<p id="65c11b5d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We decline to address the defendants’ arguments disputing the sufficiency of the plaintiff’s evidence because the trial court has not yet considered the issue. The trial court limited its ruling to the legal question of whether New Hampshire recognizes the loss of opportunity doctrine. We likewise limit our holding to that question.</p>

<div class="epub-heading cc-font-xlarge left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="65c11b5f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b">NOTES AND PROBLEMS</p></h3></div>
<p id="65c11b60-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Loss of Chance of Recovery as a But-For Problem.</i></b> Defendant in <i>Lord</i> argues that plaintiff cannot recover because plaintiff simply cannot prove but-for causation by a preponderance of the evidence. The court acknowledges that under traditional tort principles, plaintiff could not recover because plaintiff likely would have not recovered from the underlying condition even with proper treatment. Nevertheless, the court fashions a new theory permitting recovery. How does the court rationalize this new theory with the normal burden of proof requirements?</p>
<p id="65c11b61-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Damage Calculation.</i></b> The court does not specify exactly how damages should be quantified under this new theory of recovery but concedes that the plaintiff should not receive compensation for 100 percent of the injury because plaintiff would have likely had the same result regardless of the defendant’s mistreatment. In other cases, courts recognizing this theory of recovery typically provide that the jury should calculate the total damages for the injury and multiply it by a percentage reflecting the diminution in the chances for recovery.</p>
<p id="65c11b62-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Increased Risk of Harm vs. Loss of Chance.</i></b> To a large extent, the increased risk of harm scenario (reflected by <i>Carter</i>) simply reflects the other side of the coin from the loss of chance scenario in <i>Lord</i>. The former involves a scenario where the plaintiff was likely not hurt by the defendant’s misconduct and likely will never be. The latter involves a scenario where the plaintiff was likely not adversely affected by the defendant’s negligence, although the plaintiff <span title="269" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-269">p. 269</span>does have a present injury or condition (that predates the defendant’s negligence). The traditional rules are still embraced by the majority of courts in the increased risk of harm scenario but rejected by courts in the loss of chance scenario. Can you explain why? Consider how sympathetic each plaintiff is as they enter the courtroom. With the loss of chance scenario the plaintiff has suffered the harm. With increased risk of harm, the plaintiff approaches the court having suffered no harm and, in all likelihood, not ever going to suffer the harm.</p>

<p id="65c11b65-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">In many instances proving the actual causal link between the defendant’s misconduct and the plaintiff’s harm seems to satisfy tort law’s sense of fairness and justice. When an inattentive driver cruises past a stop sign into an intersection striking the plaintiff, there can be little doubt about his liability to the wounded plaintiff. But what if the driver was inattentive because he was tired, having been kept awake late at night by a neighbor hosting a loud party past midnight in violation of a noise-reduction ordinance? Perhaps the defendant driver has no liability insurance and few assets to cover the plaintiff’s losses. If the plaintiff decides to sue the noisy neighbor, the plaintiff might be able to prove that the neighbor’s careless partying was an actual, but-for cause of the accident. Or what if the driver was speeding through the intersection because he was late for an appointment, having overslept that morning when his defective alarm clock failed to wake him? If the defect was due to negligent design or manufacturing, can the wounded plaintiff sue the clock manufacturer because its carelessness was an additional, actual, but-for cause of the accident? For quite some time, tort law has recognized that it needs another check on liability in order to prevent what it perceives as unfair results when the defendant’s negligence is too remote from the plaintiff’s harm or when the accident that occurred is so surprising and unexpected. When fairness demands that the defendant prevail, despite the plaintiff’s proof of breach of duty and actual causation, the only element available is tort law’s concept of <i>proximate</i> causation.</p>
<p id="65c11b66-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some courts have referred to proximate causation as the “ultimate issue” in a negligence case. While perhaps hyperbole, it is unquestionably a complex potential issue in many cases involving <i>accidental harm</i>, particularly where there are multiple remote actors. As you may recall, courts have fairly consistently refuted any suggestion that proximate cause plays a role in intentional tort cases. For example, we saw courts reject defendants’ attempts to invoke proximate cause as a check on liability in the trespass case of <i>Baker v. Shymkiv</i> and in the battery case of <i>Nelson v. Carroll</i> in Chapter 2. In both cases of surprisingly bad harm, the courts found that the defendants satisfied the elements for the respective intentional tort and that proximate cause provided no check on liability.</p>
<span title="270" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-270">p. 270</span>
<p id="65c11b67-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet in cases of accidental harm, courts are more concerned with imposing liability on a mere careless defendant who did not intend to invade anyone’s legal interests or to cause harm of any type. In such cases, courts have labored to articulate a framework suitable to the task of separating out cases where liability is fairly imposed, from instances where it seems unfair to make the careless actor pay for the resulting unexpected harm. How to articulate a test that ultimately is measured by a vague notion of “fairness” is something for which courts have failed to find a uniform answer—so we will delve into three different existing tests modern courts continue to use for proximate cause. But first we will begin with the seminal decision in <i>Palsgraf v. Long Island Railway</i> where the judges publicly debated what was ultimately the question of <i>who should decide</i> this question of fairness—the <i>judge</i> by ruling upon the issue under the element of “duty,” or the <i>jury</i> by resolving the fairness debate under the banner of “proximate cause”?</p>

<p id="65c1427a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush"><i>Palsgraf</i> is one of those few tort cases that any astute lawyer or law student will instantly recall and about which will often have a strong opinion. The defendant railroad’s employees carelessly jostled a passenger in an ill-advised attempt to help him squeeze onto a crowded train. But that passenger was not injured. Rather, the injury occurred seconds later across the train station to another passenger hurt by the ripples of the defendant’s action. The jury found the defendant liable for negligence and judgment was entered in accordance with the verdict. The majority opinion sets aside this judgment. Set forth below are the majority opinion authored by the famous Judge Cardozo and the dissenting opinion of Judge Andrews. Pay close attention to the judges’ debate about (a) the macro issue of whether the issue of liability for a surprising result should be resolved as one of duty or proximate causation, and (b) the micro issue of whether the harm that occurred on the train station was too surprising from the standpoint of the defendant to fairly create liability.</p>

<p id="65c14281-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff was standing on a platform of defendant’s railroad after buying a ticket to go to Rockaway Beach. A train stopped at the station, bound for another place. Two men ran forward to catch it. One of the men reached the platform of the car without mishap, though the train was already moving. The other man, carrying a package, jumped aboard the car, but seemed unsteady as <span title="271" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-271">p. 271</span>if about to fall. A guard on the car, who had held the door open, reached forward to help him in, and another guard on the platform pushed him from behind. In this act, the package was dislodged, and fell upon the rails. It was a package of small size, about fifteen inches long, and was covered by a newspaper. In fact it contained fireworks, but there was nothing in its appearance to give notice of its contents. The fireworks when they fell exploded. The shock of the explosion threw down some scales at the other end of the platform, many feet away. The scales struck the plaintiff, causing injuries for which she sues.</p>
<p id="65c14282-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "></p><div style="width:500px" class="epub-image-container" id="65c14283-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b"><div class="epub-image "><img alt="A photograph of a long, two-story stone building at the corner of two city streets.

<p id="65c14284-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The conduct of the defendant’s guard, if a wrong in its relation to the holder of the package, was not a wrong in its relation to the plaintiff, standing far away. Relatively to her it was not negligence at all. Nothing in the situation gave notice that the falling package had in it the potency of peril to persons thus removed. Negligence is not actionable unless it involves the invasion of a legally protected interest, the violation of a right. “Proof of negligence in the air, so to speak, will not do” <i>Martin v. Herzog</i>, 228 N.Y. 164, 170. “Negligence is the absence of care, according to the circumstances” (Willes, J., in <i>Vaughan</i> v. <i>Taff Vale Ry. Co.</i>, 5 H. &amp; N. 679, 688). <i>Parrott</i> v. <i>Wells-Fargo Co.</i>, 15 Wall. [U.S.] 524). The plaintiff as she stood upon the platform of the station might claim to be protected against intentional invasion of her bodily security. Such invasion is not charged. She might claim to be protected against unintentional invasion by conduct involving in the thought of reasonable men an unreasonable hazard that such invasion would ensue. These, from the point of view of the law, were the bounds of her immunity, with perhaps some rare exceptions, survivals for the most part of ancient forms of liability, where conduct is held to be at the peril of the actor. If no hazard was apparent to the eye of ordinary vigilance, an act innocent and harmless, at least to outward seeming, with reference to her, did not take to itself the quality of a tort because it happened to be a wrong, though apparently not one involving the risk of bodily insecurity, with reference to some one else. “In every instance, before negligence can be predicated of a given act, back of the act must be sought and found a duty to the individual complaining, the observance of which would have averted or avoided the injury” (McSherry, C. J., in <i>W. Va. Central R. Co. v. State</i>, 96 Md. 652, 666). The plaintiff sues in her own right for a wrong personal to her, and not as the vicarious beneficiary of a breach of duty to another.</p>
<span title="272" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-272">p. 272</span>
<p id="65c16995-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A different conclusion will involve us, and swiftly too, in a maze of contradictions. A guard stumbles over a package which has been left upon a platform. It seems to be a bundle of newspapers. It turns out to be a can of dynamite. To the eye of ordinary vigilance, the bundle is abandoned waste, which may be kicked or trod on with impunity. Is a passenger at the other end of the platform protected by the law against the unsuspected hazard concealed beneath the waste? If not, is the result to be any different, so far as the distant passenger is concerned, when the guard stumbles over a valise which a truckman or a porter has left upon the walk? The passenger far away, if the victim of a wrong at all, has a cause of action, not derivative, but original and primary. His claim to be protected against invasion of his bodily security is neither greater nor less because the act resulting in the invasion is a wrong to another far removed. In this case, the rights that are said to have been violated, the interests said to have been invaded, are not even of the same order. The man was not injured in his person nor even put in danger. The purpose of the act, as well as its effect, was to make his person safe. If there was a wrong to him at all, which may very well be doubted, it was a wrong to a property interest only, the safety of his package. Out of this wrong to property, which threatened injury to nothing else, there has passed, we are told, to the plaintiff by derivation or succession a right of action for the invasion of an interest of another order, the right to bodily security. The diversity of interests emphasizes the futility of the effort to build the plaintiff’s right upon the basis of a wrong to some one else. The gain is one of emphasis, for a like result would follow if the interests were the same. Even then, the orbit of the danger as disclosed to the eye of reasonable vigilance would be the orbit of the duty. One who jostles one’s neighbor in a crowd does not invade the rights of others standing at the outer fringe when the unintended contact casts a bomb upon the ground. The wrongdoer as to them is the man who carries the bomb, not the one who explodes it without suspicion of the danger. Life will have to be made over, and human nature transformed, before prevision so extravagant can be accepted as the norm of conduct, the customary standard to which behavior must conform.</p>
<p id="65c16996-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The argument for the plaintiff is built upon the shifting meanings of such words as “wrong” and “wrongful,” and shares their instability. What the plaintiff must show is “a wrong” to herself, i.e., a violation of her own right, and not merely a wrong to someone else, nor conduct “wrongful” because unsocial, but not “a wrong” to any one. We are told that one who drives at a reckless speed through a crowded city street is guilty of a negligent act and, therefore, of a wrongful one irrespective of the consequences. Negligent the act is, and wrongful in the sense that it is unsocial, but wrongful and unsocial in relation to other travelers, only because the eye of vigilance perceives the risk of damage. If the same act were to be committed on a speedway or a race course, it would lose its wrongful quality. The risk reasonably to be perceived defines the duty to be obeyed, and risk imports relation; it is risk to another or to others within the range of apprehension. This does not mean, of course, that one who launches a <span title="273" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-273">p. 273</span>destructive force is always relieved of liability if the force, though known to be destructive, pursues an unexpected path. “It was not necessary that the defendant should have had notice of the particular method in which an accident would occur, if the possibility of an accident was clear to the ordinarily prudent eye” (<i>Munsey v. Webb</i>, 231 U.S. 150, 156). Some acts, such as shooting, are so imminently dangerous to any one who may come within reach of the missile, however unexpectedly, as to impose a duty of prevision not far from that of an insurer. Even today, and much oftener in earlier stages of the law, one acts sometimes at one’s peril. (Under this head, it may be, fall certain cases of what is known as transferred intent, an act willfully dangerous to A resulting by misadventure in injury to B. These cases aside, wrong is defined in terms of the natural or probable, at least when unintentional (<i>Parrot</i> v. <i>Wells-Fargo Co.</i> [the “Nitro-Glycerine Case”], 15 Wall. [U.S.] 524). The range of reasonable apprehension is at times a question for the court, and at times, if varying inferences are possible, a question for the jury. Here, by concession, there was nothing in the situation to suggest to the most cautious mind that the parcel wrapped in newspaper would spread wreckage through the station. If the guard had thrown it down knowingly and willfully, he would not have threatened the plaintiff’s safety, so far as appearances could warn him. His conduct would not have involved, even then, an unreasonable probability of invasion of her bodily security. Liability can be no greater where the act is inadvertent.</p>
<p id="65c16997-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Negligence, like risk, is thus a term of relation. Negligence in the abstract, apart from things related, is surely not a tort, if indeed it is understandable at all. Negligence is not a tort unless it results in the commission of a wrong, and the commission of a wrong imports the violation of a right, in this case, we are told, the right to be protected against interference with one’s bodily security.…The victim does not sue derivatively, or by right of subrogation, to vindicate an interest invaded in the person of another. Thus to view his cause of action is to ignore the fundamental difference between tort and crime. He sues for breach of a duty owing to himself.</p>
<p id="65c16998-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The law of causation, remote or proximate, is thus foreign to the case before us. The question of liability is always anterior to the question of the measure of the consequences that go with liability. If there is no tort to be redressed, there is no occasion to consider what damage might be recovered if there were a finding of a tort. We may assume, without deciding, that negligence, not at large or in the abstract, but in relation to the plaintiff, would entail liability for any and all consequences, however novel or extraordinary. There is room for argument that a distinction is to be drawn according to the diversity of interests invaded by the act, as where conduct negligent in that it threatens an insignificant invasion of an interest in property results in an unforseeable invasion of an interest of another order, as, <i>e. g.</i>, one of bodily security. Perhaps other distinctions may be necessary. We do not go into the question now. The consequences to be followed must first be rooted in a wrong.</p>

<p id="65c1699f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Assisting a passenger to board a train, the defendant’s servant negligently knocked a package from his arms. It fell between the platform and the cars. Of its contents the servant knew and could know nothing. A violent explosion followed. The concussion broke some scales standing a considerable distance away. In falling they injured the plaintiff, an intending passenger.</p>
<p id="65c169a0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Upon these facts may she recover the damages she has suffered in an action brought against the master? The result we shall reach depends upon our theory as to the nature of negligence. Is it a relative concept—the breach of some duty owing to a particular person or to particular persons? Or where there is an act which unreasonably threatens the safety of others, is the doer liable for all its proximate consequences, even where they result in injury to one who would generally be thought to be outside the radius of danger? This is not a mere dispute as to words. We might not believe that to the average mind the dropping of the bundle would seem to involve the probability of harm to the plaintiff standing many feet away whatever might be the case as to the owner or to one so near as to be likely to be struck by its fall. If, however, we adopt the second hypothesis we have to inquire only as to the relation between cause and effect. We deal in terms of proximate cause, not of negligence.</p>
<span title="275" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-275">p. 275</span>
<p id="65c169a1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Negligence may be defined roughly as an act or omission which unreasonably does or may affect the rights of others, or which unreasonably fails to protect oneself from the dangers resulting from such acts. Here I confine myself to the first branch of the definition. Nor do I comment on the word “unreasonable.” For present purposes it sufficiently describes that average of conduct that society requires of its members.</p>
<p id="65c190b2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But we are told that “there is no negligence unless there is in the particular case a legal duty to take care, and this duty must be one which is owed to the plaintiff himself and not merely to others.” (Salmond Torts [6th ed.], 24.) This, I think too narrow a conception. Where there is the unreasonable act, and some right that may be affected, there is negligence whether damage does or does not result. That is immaterial. Should we drive down Broadway at a reckless speed, we are negligent whether we strike an approaching car or miss it by an inch. The act itself is wrongful. It is a wrong not only to those who happen to be within the radius of danger but to all who might have been there—a wrong to the public at large. Such is the language of the street.…As was said by Mr. Justice Holmes many years ago, “the measure of the defendant’s duty in determining whether a wrong has been committed is one thing, the measure of liability when a wrong has been committed is another.” (<i>Spade v. Lynn &amp; Boston R.R. Co.</i>, 172 Mass. 488.) Due care is a duty imposed on each one of us to protect society from unnecessary danger, not to protect A, B or C alone.</p>
<p id="65c190b3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It may well be that there is no such thing as negligence in the abstract. “Proof of negligence in the air, so to speak, will not do.” In an empty world negligence would not exist. It does involve a relationship between man and his fellows. But not merely a relationship between man and those whom he might reasonably expect his act would injure. Rather, a relationship between him and those whom he does in fact injure. If his act has a tendency to harm some one, it harms him a mile away as surely as it does those on the scene. We now permit children to recover for the negligent killing of the father. It was never prevented on the theory that no duty was owing to them. A husband may be compensated for the loss of his wife’s services. To say that the wrongdoer was negligent as to the husband as well as to the wife is merely an attempt to fit facts to theory. An insurance company paying a fire loss recovers its payment of the negligent incendiary. We speak of subrogation—of suing in the right of the insured. Behind the cloud of words is the fact they hide, that the act, wrongful as to the insured, has also injured the company. Even if it be true that the fault of father, wife or insured will prevent recovery, it is because we consider the original negligence not the proximate cause of the injury.</p>
<p id="65c190b4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the well-known <i>Polemis Case</i> (1921, 3 K.B. 560), Scrutton, L.J., said that the dropping of a plank was negligent for it might injure “workman or cargo or ship.” Because of either possibility the owner of the vessel was to be made good for his loss. The act being wrongful the doer was liable for its proximate results. Criticized and explained as this statement may have been, I think it states the law as it should be and as it is.</p>
<span title="276" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-276">p. 276</span>
<p id="65c190b5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The proposition is this. Everyone owes to the world at large the duty of refraining from those acts that may unreasonably threaten the safety of others. Such an act occurs. Not only is he wronged to whom harm might reasonably be expected to result, but he also who is in fact injured, even if he be outside what would generally be thought the danger zone. There needs be duty due the one complaining but this is not a duty to a particular individual because as to him harm might be expected. Harm to some one being the natural result of the act, not only that one alone, but all those in fact injured may complain. We have never, I think, held otherwise.…Unreasonable risk being taken, its consequences are not confined to those who might probably be hurt.</p>
<p id="65c190b6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If this be so, we do not have a plaintiff suing by “derivation or succession.” Her action is original and primary. Her claim is for a breach of duty to herself—not that she is subrogated to any right of action of the owner of the parcel or of a passenger standing at the scene of the explosion.</p>
<p id="65c190b7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The right to recover damages rests on additional considerations. The plaintiff’s rights must be injured, and this injury must be caused by the negligence. We build a dam, but are negligent as to its foundations. Breaking, it injures property down stream. We are not liable if all this happened because of some reason other than the insecure foundation. But when injuries do result from our unlawful act we are liable for the consequences. It does not matter that they are unusual, unexpected, unforeseen and unforeseeable. But there is one limitation. The damages must be so connected with the negligence that the latter may be said to be the proximate cause of the former.</p>
<p id="65c190b8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These two words have never been given an inclusive definition. What is a cause in a legal sense, still more what is a proximate cause, depend in each case upon many considerations, as does the existence of negligence itself. Any philosophical doctrine of causation does not help us. A boy throws a stone into a pond. The ripples spread. The water level rises. The history of that pond is altered to all eternity. It will be altered by other causes also. Yet it will be forever the resultant of all causes combined. Each one will have an influence. How great only omniscience can say. You may speak of a chain, or if you please, a net. An analogy is of little aid. Each cause brings about future events. Without each the future would not be the same. Each is proximate in the sense it is essential. But that is not what we mean by the word. Nor on the other hand do we mean sole cause. There is no such thing.</p>
<p id="65c190b9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Should analogy be thought helpful, however, I prefer that of a stream. The spring, starting on its journey, is joined by tributary after tributary. The river, reaching the ocean, comes from a hundred sources. No man may say whence any drop of water is derived. Yet for a time distinction may be possible. Into the clear creek, brown swamp water flows from the left. Later, from the right comes water stained by its clay bed. The three may remain for a space, sharply divided. But at last, inevitably no trace of separation remains. They are so commingled that all distinction is lost.</p>
<p id="65c190ba-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As we have said, we cannot trace the effect of an act to the end, if end there is. Again, however, we may trace it part of the way. A murder at Serajevo may be <span title="277" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-277">p. 277</span>the necessary antecedent to an assassination in London twenty years hence. An overturned lantern may burn all Chicago. We may follow the fire from the shed to the last building. We rightly say the fire started by the lantern caused its destruction.</p>
<p id="65c190bb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A cause, but not the proximate cause. What we do mean by the word “proximate” is, that because of convenience, of public policy, of a rough sense of justice, the law arbitrarily declines to trace a series of events beyond a certain point. This is not logic. It is practical politics. Take our rule as to fires. Sparks from my burning haystack set on fire my house and my neighbor’s. I may recover from a negligent railroad. He may not. Yet the wrongful act as directly harmed the one as the other. We may regret that the line was drawn just where it was, but drawn somewhere it had to be. We said the act of the railroad was not the proximate cause of our neighbor’s fire. Cause it surely was. The words we used were simply indicative of our notions of public policy. Other courts think differently. But somewhere they reach the point where they cannot say the stream comes from any one source.</p>
<p id="65c190bc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is all a question of expediency. There are no fixed rules to govern our judgment. There are simply matters of which we may take account. We have in a somewhat different connection spoken of “the stream of events.” We have asked whether that stream was deflected—whether it was forced into new and unexpected channels. This is rather rhetoric than law. There is in truth little to guide us other than common sense.</p>
<p id="65c190bd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are some hints that may help us. The proximate cause, involved as it may be with many other causes, must be, at the least, something without which the event would not happen. The court must ask itself whether there was a natural and continuous sequence between cause and effect. Was the one a substantial factor in producing the other? Was there a direct connection between them, without too many intervening causes? Is the effect of cause on result not too attenuated? Is the cause likely, in the usual judgment of mankind, to produce the result? Or by the exercise of prudent foresight could the result be foreseen? Is the result too remote from the cause, and here we consider remoteness in time and space.…Clearly we must so consider, for the greater the distance either in time or space, the more surely do other causes intervene to affect the result. When a lantern is overturned the firing of a shed is a fairly direct consequence. Many things contribute to the spread of the conflagration—the force of the wind, the direction and width of streets, the character of intervening structures, other factors. We draw an uncertain and wavering line, but draw it we must as best we can.</p>
<p id="65c190be-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once again, it is all a question of fair judgment, always keeping in mind the fact that we endeavor to make a rule in each case that will be practical and in keeping with the general understanding of mankind.</p>
<p id="65c1b7cf-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This last suggestion is the factor which must determine the case before us. The act upon which defendant’s liability rests is knocking an apparently harmless package onto the platform. The act was negligent. For its proximate consequences the defendant is liable. If its contents were broken, to the owner; if it <span title="278" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-278">p. 278</span>fell upon and crushed a passenger’s foot, then to him. If it exploded and injured one in the immediate vicinity, to him also as to A in the illustration. Mrs. Palsgraf was standing some distance away. How far cannot be told from the record—apparently twenty-five or thirty feet. Perhaps less. Except for the explosion, she would not have been injured. We are told by the appellant in his brief “it cannot be denied that the explosion was the direct cause of the plaintiff’s injuries.” So it was a substantial factor in producing the result—there was here a natural and continuous sequence—direct connection. The only intervening cause was that instead of blowing her to the ground the concussion smashed the weighing machine which in turn fell upon her. There was no remoteness in time, little in space. And surely, given such an explosion as here it needed no great foresight to predict that the natural result would be to injure one on the platform at no greater distance from its scene than was the plaintiff. Just how no one might be able to predict. Whether by flying fragments, by broken glass, by wreckage of machines or structures no one could say. But injury in some form was most probable.</p>
<p id="65c1b7d0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under these circumstances I cannot say as a matter of law that the plaintiff’s injuries were not the proximate result of the negligence. That is all we have before us. The court refused to so charge. No request was made to submit the matter to the jury as a question of fact, even would that have been proper upon the record before us.</p>
<p id="65c1b7d1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>

<p id="65c1b7d4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Dealing with Bizarre Consequences.</i></b> <i>Palsgraf</i> is the classic torts case in which two esteemed judges have a war of words regarding how tort law should deal with determining the scope of liability for unusual accidents. With respect to the elements of a negligence case, where does Judge Cardozo believe the unusual nature of the accident should primarily be analyzed? How does Judge Andrews disagree? Is this just a game of semantics or some philosophical debate suitable for a law school lecture? Does the issue of who should decide liability in cases of surprising outcomes make any difference? The answer may ultimately lie in where we place our trust for this question to be answered. Questions of <i>duty</i> are classically viewed as questions of law for the court to determine, while questions of <i>proximate cause</i> are generally considered questions of fact for the jury to answer. Whether you find yourself agreeing with Cardozo or Andrews may reflect upon <i>who</i> you believe should be answering the question of how far removed liability should be extended.</p>
<p id="65c1b7d5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Torts at a Crossroads.</i></b> Judge Cardozo decided to question the assumption that we owe a duty of reasonable care at all times to all people. Many courts in negligence cases do revisit this assumption under certain circumstances while ignoring the issue of duty in most negligence cases. In Chapter 6, Special Duty Rules, we will return to the issue of duty by visiting <span title="279" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-279">p. 279</span>these recurring instances of courts pausing at the element of “duty” and divining whether a duty of reasonable care exists or should be modified. But first, because most courts in practice routinely presume a duty of reasonable care (as we shall see in Chapter 6, Special Duty Rules) and instead handle issues of unusual accidents under the analytical framework of “proximate” or “legal” causation, we will turn to that topic in the next subsection of this chapter. Judge Andrews’ dissent introduced to us several examples of <i>proximate cause</i> analysis.</p>
<p id="65c1b7d6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>And the Winner Is?</i></b> With respect to the issue of duty, once you have covered Chapter 6, Special Duty Rules, turn back to the facts of <i>Palsgraf</i> and ask yourself if Judge Cardozo reached the right conclusion on the issue of whether the defendant owed plaintiff a duty of care. In terms of their practice, most courts today would agree with Judge Andrews on the macro issue of whether <i>Palsgraf</i> was a proximate cause or a duty case. As you will see in the next chapter, courts generally assume a duty of care in circumstances where a defendant acts. Further, due to defendant’s affirmative conduct, the status of plaintiff as a business invitee, and defendant’s status as a common carrier, it is doubtful any court today would bother to debate whether a duty of care existed toward Ms. Palsgraf. Yet many courts might disagree with Judge Andrews’ micro conclusion that proximate cause existed on the facts of that case, depending upon the specific proximate cause test selected. As we explore the actual proximate cause tests in the next section, you should come back to the facts of <i>Palsgraf</i> and Judge Andrews’ opinion, and ask yourself if he got the actual results of that case right.</p>

They had placed wooden planks across the ship’s hold to assist them during the unloading of the ship. The stevedores used slings to move the cargo up from the ship’s hold. Petrol vapors were in the air within the ship’s cargo hold due to leaking of benzene and petrol.] In the course of heaving a sling of the cases from the hold, the rope by which the sling was being raised or the sling itself came into contact with the boards placed across the forward end of the hatch, causing one of the boards to fall into the lower hold, and the fall was instantaneously followed by a rush of flames from the lower hold, and this resulted eventually in the total destruction of the ship.</p>

<p id="65c20608-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defence is that the damage is too remote from the negligence, as it could not be reasonably foreseen as a consequence. On this head we were referred to a number of well known cases in which vague language, which I cannot think to be really helpful, has been used in an attempt to define the point at which damage becomes too remote from, or not sufficiently directly caused by, the breach of duty, which is the original cause of action, to be recoverable. For instance, I cannot think it useful to say the damage must be the natural and probable result. This suggests that there are results which are natural but not probable, and other results which are probable but not natural. I am not sure what either adjective means in this connection; if they mean the same thing, two need not be used; if they mean different things, the difference between them should be defined.…To determine whether an act is negligent, it is relevant to determine whether any reasonable person would foresee that the act would cause damage; if he would not, the act is not negligent. But if the act would or might probably cause damage, the fact that the damage it in fact causes is not the exact kind of damage one would expect is immaterial, so long as the damage is in fact directly traceable to the negligent act, and not due the operation of independent causes having no connection with the negligent act, except that they could not avoid its results. Once the act is negligent, the fact that its exact operation was not foreseen is immaterial.…In the present case it was negligent in discharging cargo to known down the planks of the temporary staging, for they might easily cause some damages either to workmen, or cargo, or the ship. The fact that they did directly produce an unexpected result, a spark in an atmosphere of petrol vapour which caused a fire, does not relieve the person who was negligent from the damage which his negligent act directly caused.</p>

<p id="65c22d1f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On January 21, 1985, the plaintiff, a tenant in the defendants’ premises, arose from bed at approximately 5 A.M. and put two large pots of water on her stove to boil. While in the process of pouring the boiling water from one pot into the other, the plaintiff banged the pots against each other, causing the boiling water to spill onto her knee and feet. The plaintiff commenced the instant action, alleging, <i>inter alia</i>, that the defendants’ negligence in failing to provide heat and hot water to the premises and in failing to maintain the boiler in proper working condition caused the incident and her resulting <span title="282" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-282">p. 282</span>injuries. The plaintiff further alleged that the defendants had constructive notice of the defective condition at least two weeks prior to the incident, as well as actual notice. The defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground that their conduct was not, as a matter of law, the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injuries. The trial court granted the motion holding that “there was no connection of proximate cause between the lack of heat and the accident.” We affirm.</p>
<p id="65c22d20-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendants’ failure to provide heat and hot water to the premises was not the proximate cause, as a matter of law, of the injuries sustained by the plaintiff. [T]he defendants’ conduct gave rise to the plaintiff’s attempt to provide a substitute supply of heat. [Yet] the intervening act of banging one pot against the other brought about the injuries sustained by the plaintiff. Those injuries would not have resulted from the failure to supply hot water alone, and cannot be classified as injuries normally to have been expected to ensue from the landlord’s conduct.</p>

This test considers whether the nature of the harm or accident giving rise to the plaintiff’s claim was the same general type of harm or accident that was within the scope of the original risk that permitted a finding of breach of the duty of reasonable care. There is a natural symmetry, therefore, between this proximate cause test and the Learned Hand analysis already employed in the breach determination. The following case illustrates its application to another scenario involving a rather bizarre twist of events. As you read each case in the Proximate Cause section of this book, consider whether the facts of each case would satisfy the other proximate cause tests as well. Doing so will help you conclude whether, and to what extent, the choice of proximate cause tests matters.</p>

<p id="65c25443-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is a consolidated appeal by the plaintiffs from (1) a final order dismissing a complaint as to one defendant, and (2) a final summary judgment entered in favor of a second defendant, in a wrongful death action. The trial court concluded that the defendants’ alleged negligence was not, as a matter of law, a proximate cause of the death of the plaintiffs’ decedent. For the reasons which follow, we disagree and reverse.</p>
<p id="65c25444-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The facts of this case, as alleged in the operative complaint and as developed by the discovery and affidavits filed in the record, may be briefly stated as follows.</p>
<p id="65c25445-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On January 7, 1983, at approximately 9:00 P.M., the plaintiffs’ decedent, Trudi Beth Tieder, was struck by an automobile, pinned up against a brick wall, and killed when the wall collapsed on her—as she walked out the front door of Eaton Hall dormitory on the University of Miami campus. At the time, two students were attempting to clutch-start an automobile in the circular drive in front of Eaton Hall—one student was pushing the car while the other student was in the car behind the wheel—when, suddenly, the student behind the wheel lost control of the car. The automobile left the circular driveway, lurched over a three-inch curb onto a grassy area, and travelled some thirty-three feet across the front lawn parallel to Eaton Hall. The automobile collided with an elevated walkway leading out of the front door of Eaton Hall, <span title="284" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-284">p. 284</span>jumped onto the walkway, and struck the plaintiffs’ decedent as she walked out the front door of the dormitory. The automobile continued forward, pinning the decedent against a high brick wall that supported a concrete canopy at the entrance to the dormitory. Because the wall was negligently designed and constructed without adequate supports required by the applicable building code, the entire wall came off intact from its foundation and crushed her to death. Dr. Joseph Davis, the Dade County Medical Examiner, averred by affidavit that in his opinion the decedent would not have died merely from the automobile impact; in his opinion, she died as a result of the brick wall falling intact and in one piece upon her. Two affidavits of professional engineers were also filed below detailing the negligent design and construction of the subject brick wall.</p>
<p id="65c25446-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiffs Sheila M. Tieder and Richard J. Tieder, administrators of the estate of Trudi Beth Tieder, brought a wrongful death action against: (1) the owner and the operator of the automobile (not parties to this appeal), (2) Robert M. Little, the architect who designed the allegedly defective brick wall, and (3) the University of Miami, which caused the said brick wall to be erected and maintained. The amended complaint charged the defendant Little and the University of Miami with various acts of negligent conduct including negligence in the design and construction of the brick wall. The defendant Little moved to dismiss the complaint against him and urged that his alleged negligence was not, as a matter of law, the proximate cause of the decedent’s death because the entire accident was so bizarre as to be entirely unforeseeable; the University of Miami moved for a summary judgment in its favor and made the same argument. The trial court agreed and granted both motions.…</p>
<p id="65c25447-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the instant case, the parties appear to agree that, for complaint dismissal and summary judgment purposes, the first two elements of the plaintiff’s negligence (wrongful death) action are shown on this record. It is solely the third element of “proximate cause” which is in dispute in this case. The defendants contended below, and the trial court agreed, that the defendants’ negligence in designing and constructing the brick wall was not, as a matter of law, the proximate cause of the death of the plaintiffs’ decedent. The plaintiffs, on the other hand, contend that the complaint alleges sufficient facts, and the record raises sufficient issues of material fact, that a jury issue is presented on the proximate cause element. It is therefore necessary to consult the applicable Florida law on “proximate cause” in negligence actions as applied to the facts presented herein.</p>
<p id="65c25448-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the outset, the “proximate cause” element of a negligence action embraces, as a <i>sine qua non</i> ingredient, a causation-in-fact test, that is, the defendant’s negligence must be a cause-in-fact of the plaintiff’s injuries. Generally speaking, Florida courts have followed a “but-for” causation-in-fact test, that is, “to constitute proximate cause there must be such a natural, direct and continuous sequence between the negligent act [or omission] and the <span title="285" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-285">p. 285</span>[plaintiff’s] injury that it can be reasonably said that <i>but for</i> the [negligent] act [or omission] the injury would not have occurred.” There is, however, a “substantial factor” exception to the “but-for” test where two causes concur to bring about an event in fact, either one of which would have been sufficient to cause the identical result. <i>Stahl v. Metropolitan Dade County</i>, 438 So. 2d 14, 18-19 (Fla. 3d DCA 1983). In that narrow circumstance, it is settled that a “defendant’s conduct in an action for personal injuries is considered a cause [in fact] of the event if it was a material and substantial factor in bringing it about.” <i>Loftin v. Wilson</i>, 67 So. 2d 185, 191 (Fla. 1953).</p>
<p id="65c25449-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to the causation-in-fact test, the “proximate cause” element of a negligence action includes a second indispensable showing. This showing is designed to protect defendants from tort liability for results which, although caused-in-fact by the defendant’s negligent act or omission, seem to the judicial mind highly unusual, extraordinary, or bizarre, or, stated differently, seem beyond the scope of any fair assessment of the danger created by the defendant’s negligence. The courts here have required a common sense, fairness showing that the accident in which the plaintiff suffered his injuries was within the scope of the danger created by the defendant’s negligence, or stated differently, that the said accident was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendant’s negligence.</p>
<p id="65c2544a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is not necessary, however, that the defendant foresee the exact sequence of events which led to the accident sued upon; it is only necessary that the general type of accident which has occurred was within the scope of the danger created by the defendant’s negligence, or, stated differently, it must be shown that the said general-type accident was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendant’s negligence.…Moreover, it has long been held that “proximate cause” issues are generally for juries to decide using their common sense upon appropriate instructions, although occasionally when reasonable people cannot differ, the issue has been said to be one of law for the court.</p>
<p id="65c2544b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Turning now to the instant case, we have no difficulty in concluding that the trial court erred in dismissing the complaint against the defendant Little and in entering a final summary judgment in favor of the University of Miami. This is so because the complaint sufficiently alleges the proximate cause element herein as to the defendant Little, and the record raises genuine issues of material fact with reference to the same element as to the defendant University of Miami.</p>

</div>
<p id="65c2544f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plainly, the alleged negligence in designing and constructing the brick wall adjoining the entrance way to Eaton Hall in this case was a cause-in-fact of the accident which led to the death of the plaintiffs’ decedent. It is alleged that the said wall was designed and built with insufficient supports as required by the applicable building code so that, when it was impacted <span title="286" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-286">p. 286</span>in this case, it fell over intact, and in one piece, on the decedent. Dr. Joseph Davis, the Dade County Medical Examiner, avers that in his opinion the decedent died as a result of the brick wall falling intact upon her. “But for” the negligent design and construction of the brick wall which led to its collapse in one piece, then, the decedent would not have died. A jury question is therefore presented on this aspect of the proximate cause element.</p>
<p id="65c25450-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The foreseeability aspect of the proximate cause element is also satisfied in this case for the complaint dismissal and summary judgment purposes. The collapse of a brick wall resulting in the death of a person near such wall is plainly a reasonably foreseeable consequence of negligently designing and constructing such a wall without adequate supports in violation of applicable building codes—even though the exact sequence of events leading to the collapse of the wall—as in this case, the bizarre incident involving the clutch-started automobile leaving the circular driveway and striking the wall—may have been entirely unforeseeable. The general-type accident which occurred in this case—namely, the collapse of the brick wall resulting in the decedent’s death—was entirely within the scope of the danger created by the defendants’ negligence in designing and constructing the wall without adequate supports, and was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of such negligence. Just as injuries sustained by business patrons in attempting to escape a fire in a cafeteria or hotel was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the cafeteria or hotel’s negligence in failing to have adequate fire exits, even though the act of the arsonist in setting the building aflame was entirely unforeseeable—so too the death of the plaintiffs’ decedent was entirely foreseeable in this case even though the exact sequence of events leading to the collapse of the wall may have been unforeseeable. This being so, a jury issue is presented on the proximate cause element as pled in the complaint and revealed by this record.</p>
<p id="65c25451-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The final order of dismissal and the final summary judgment under review are both reversed and the cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>

If the accident that hurt the plaintiff was one of those possible accidents that led to the conclusion that defendant breached its duty, by failing to exercise enough care to avoid it from occurring, then the foreseeability test is satisfied. What types of events were within the scope of the foreseeable risks of harm that would have compelled the reasonable person to comply with the building code in <i>Tieder</i>? <span title="287" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-287">p. 287</span>Is what happened to the plaintiff—an insufficiently supported wall collapsing when force was applied to it—the reason for compliance with the building code?</p>
<p id="65c27b66-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Popularity of the Foreseeability Test.</i></b> Though some courts persist in using the direct cause test, and some others have adopted a <i>substantial factor</i> test (which we will explore next), the majority of courts analyze proximate cause using the foreseeability test. Even English courts that created the direct cause test—as we saw in <i>Polemis</i>—subsequently rejected that analysis. In the case of <i>The Wagon Mound</i>, 1961 A.C. 388 (P.C.), the Privy Council opined: “Enough has been said to show that the authority of <i>Polemis</i> has been severely shaken though lip-service has from time to time been paid to it. In their Lordships’ opinion it should no longer be regarded as good law.” Instead, the court adopted the test of reasonable foreseeability.</p>
<p id="65c27b67-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Palsgraf <i>Revisited.</i></b> In dissent, Judge Andrews analyzed the plaintiff’s accident in <i>Palsgraf</i> under the various proximate cause tests. With respect to the foreseeability test, he concluded that “surely, given such an explosion as here it needed no great foresight to predict that the natural result would be to injure one on the platform at no greater distance…than was the plaintiff”. Do you agree with Judge Andrews’ application of the foreseeability test for proximate cause? Was it the foreseeable risk of injury to Ms. Palsgraf that made the railway employees’ decision to reach out and touch the leaping passenger negligent?</p>
<p id="65c27b68-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Foreseeing the Type of Harm Rather Than the Extent of It.</i></b> In jurisdictions utilizing the foreseeability test, defendants have sometimes asserted that they should not be liable if the amount of harm suffered by the plaintiff is greater than could have been reasonably foreseen. For example, imagine a driver goes through a red light and hits a very frail pedestrian. This plaintiff suffers permanent, disabling injuries due to a prior history of orthopedic problems with her legs. Courts reject this attempt to limit liability, citing the <i>Eggshell Plaintiff</i> rule—that a negligent tortfeasor “takes his victim as he finds him.” The Restatement of Torts (Second) §461 <i>comment</i> (a) (1965) states that, “A negligent actor must bear the risk that his liability will be increased by reason of the actual physical condition of the other toward whom his act is negligent.” A related doctrine is the <i>Shabby Millionaire Rule</i>, which makes a defendant liable for unforeseeable economic losses (i.e., lost wages) of someone who appeared to have a low income. Thus, for purposes of proximate cause, the <i>extent</i> of harm need not be foreseeable. How does this compare with <i>breach</i> analysis in terms of whether the extent of harm is pertinent? Remember the Learned Hand formula in pondering this distinction. How does this formula reflect the reality that the extent of foreseeable harm is directly relevant to analyzing breach of the duty of reasonable care?</p>

Harris and Miss Arlene Harris patronized the dining room of the defendant; that Miss Harris ordered shrimp and began eating same at which time she noticed a peculiar odor emanating from the shrimp dish causing her to feel nauseated; that Miss Harris excused herself and proceeded toward the rest room; shortly thereafter plaintiff proceeded toward the rest room to give aid and comfort to Miss Harris and as plaintiff entered the rest room she saw Miss Harris leaning over one of the bowls; that “unbeknownst to plaintiff, Miss Harris had vomited just inside the entrance to the rest room” and that as she hurried toward her she “stepped into the vomit, and her feet flew out from under her,” causing her to fall and break her hip. The petition alleged negligence of the defendant in selling unwholesome, deleterious food and in failing to clean up the floor of the rest room or to warn plaintiff of the condition of the floor.</p>

<p id="65c2a285-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant in her brief properly abandons the allegation of negligence due to defendant’s failure to clean the regurgitated substance from the floor since under the facts alleged the defendant had no notice, actual or constructive, of its presence on the floor prior to plaintiff’s fall. Appellant contends, however, that “the heart of the legal question presented” is whether or not the negligent serving of unwholesome food to Miss Harris was the proximate cause of her (appellant’s) injury. Viewing the case from this posed question we conclude that the trial court was correct in sustaining the general demurrer.</p>
<p id="65c2a286-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“If the damages are only the imaginary or possible result of the tortious act, or other and contingent circumstances preponderate largely in causing the injurious effect, such damages are too remote to be the basis of recovery against the wrongdoer.” <i>Code</i> §105-2008. Damages must flow from the “legal and natural result of the act done.” <i>Code</i> §105-2009. The question of proximate cause is one for a jury except in palpably clear and indisputable cases. We think the facts alleged in this petition bring it within the exception and subject it to be ruled upon as a matter of law. The court must assume this burden where a jury can draw but one reasonable conclusion if the facts alleged are proved, that conclusion being that the acts of the defendant were not the proximate cause of the injury. In our opinion a jury could not reasonably conclude that the plaintiff’s injury was proximately caused by the defendant’s negligence in serving unwholesome food to another person.</p>

We will first familiarize ourselves with the substantial factor test in <i>Brisboy</i>—a case involving multiple independent sufficient causes, where the court is using it as an alternative to but-for actual causation.

<p id="65c2a294-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">In its earliest inception, the substantial factor test was introduced by courts as an alternative to the but-for test for actual causation in scenarios where there were multiple independent sufficient causes—such as we saw earlier in this chapter with the two fires burning down the plaintiff’s property. Understanding that it was impossible for either of the two fires to constitute a true but-for cause, courts began instead to ask whether either or both of the fires were a “substantial factor” in causing the plaintiff’s harm. The <i>Brisboy</i> case below depicts just such a scenario where the court utilizes the substantial factor test as an alternative to demanding proof that any of the defendants’ conduct (or here, products) was a but-for cause of the harm.</p>

<p id="65c2c9ab-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant appeals as of right from a jury verdict finding the defendant’s negligence in failing to warn the plaintiff’s decedent of the danger of working with asbestos products to be the proximate cause of his death.</p>
<p id="65c2c9ac-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Charlotte Rand filed a complaint on October 31, 1979, seeking damages for the wrongful death of her husband, Charles Rand. Plaintiff alleged that her decedent died as a result of lung cancer caused by asbestosis contracted during his 26-year career as an asbestos insulation worker. Plaintiff named as defendants the nine employers her decedent had worked for from 1951 until 1977, but three of those defendants settled with the plaintiff prior to trial. [By the end of trial the lone remaining defendant was Fibreboard.]</p>
<p id="65c2c9ad-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The testimony of a coworker of the decedent, Laurence Jean, revealed that the decedent worked for the defendant for at least six months and at most nine months as an asbestos insulator, <i>i.e</i>., applying insulation material containing asbestos to various pipes. Mr. Jean testified that the air was “very, very dusty” while performing the work, and that there was no way to avoid breathing this dust.</p>
<p id="65c2c9ae-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The evidence presented at trial also revealed that plaintiff’s decedent was a heavy cigarette user, having smoked two packs per day for 30 years. The effect of the cigarette use on the plaintiff’s condition was disputed by the medical experts presented by the parties. Dr. Joseph Wagoner, appearing on behalf of the plaintiff, discounted the effect of Mr. Rand’s cigarette smoking on the grounds that Mr. Rand died of adenocarcinoma, and that cigarette smoking is more related to the squamous-type cell, not the adeno type. Dr. Wagoner concluded that cigarette smoking does not increase an asbestos worker’s risk of developing lung cancer.</p>
<p id="65c2c9af-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dr. Leighton Kong, who performed the autopsy on the decedent, admitted that cigarette smoking can be related to adenocarcinoma of the lung, and in fact could have been the sole cause of Mr. Rand’s lung cancer. However, Dr. Kong believed that there is a stronger link between asbestosis and cancer than cigarette smoking and cancer.</p>
<p id="65c2c9b0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dr. Gerrit Scheppes also testified on plaintiff’s behalf. Dr. Scheppes indicated that, in his opinion, Mr. Rand’s lung cancer was caused by asbestosis. However, Dr. Scheppes admitted that Mr. Rand’s history of cigarette smoking played a minor contributing role in the development of his lung cancer.</p>
<p id="65c2c9b1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant’s medical evidence included the testimony of Dr. Harry Demopoulos. Dr. Demopoulos opined that Mr. Rand did not suffer from asbestosis and that Mr. Rand’s adenocarcinoma was due solely to cigarette smoking. Dr. William Weiss testified that Mr. Rand had no evidence of pulmonary asbestosis and, in light of this fact, Mr. Rand’s development of lung cancer was <span title="292" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-292">p. 292</span>attributable to his history of cigarette smoking. Dr. Weiss also testified that, while asbestosis and cigarette smoking can combine to create a synergistic effect and thus a greater risk of developing lung cancer than the additive risk of the two factors alone, this increased risk does not exist without the presence of asbestosis.</p>
<p id="65c2c9b2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On appeal, defendant first argues that there was insufficient evidence to establish that Mr. Rand’s six-to nine-month exposure to defendant’s asbestos products was a proximate cause of his death. Defendant argues that the trial court therefore improperly denied defendant’s motion for a directed verdict.…</p>
<p id="65c2c9b3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under Michigan law, an actor will not be held liable for his negligent conduct unless that conduct was a legal or proximate cause of the harm to the plaintiff. There may be more than one proximate cause of an injury, and thus the mere fact that some other cause concurs, contributes, or cooperates to produce an injury does not relieve any of the parties whose negligent conduct was one of the causes of the plaintiff’s harm. An actor’s negligent conduct will not be a legal or proximate cause of the harm to another unless that conduct was a substantial factor in bringing about the harm. <i>McLean v. Rogers</i>, 300 N.W.2d 389 (1980). One of the considerations in determining whether an actor’s conduct was a substantial factor in bringing about the harm to another is “the number of other factors which contribute in producing the harm and the extent of the effect which they have in producing it.” 2 Restatement Torts, 2d, §433(a), p. 432. Where a number of events each contribute to the ultimate harm, one may have such a predominant effect as to make the effect of a particular actor’s negligence insignificant. On the other hand, where none of the contributing factors has a predominant effect, their combined effect may act to dilute the effect of the actor’s negligence and prevent it from becoming a substantial factor in bringing about the harm.</p>
<p id="65c2c9b4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff’s proofs, viewed in the light most favorable to him, revealed the following. Mr. Rand’s autopsy indicated that he died from cancer resulting from asbestosis and that there was a massive amount of asbestos in his lungs. The nature of the disease from which Mr. Rand suffered is that it progresses cumulatively, with each group of asbestos fibers which lodges in the lung doing damage to the area in which it is present. The exposure to asbestos need not be extensive, and, in fact, even one month of exposure may cause asbestosis and ultimately result in the victim’s death. Consequently, there is no safe level of exposure to any carcinogen.</p>
<p id="65c2c9b5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This evidence was sufficient to permit reasonable minds to conclude that Mr. Rand died, at least in part, due to the development of asbestosis in his lungs as a result of his inhalation of asbestos fibers during his working career. While plaintiff naturally could not directly prove that defendant’s asbestos fibers caused the disease which led to his death (it is impossible to determine which particular fibers from the group of fibers to which Mr. Rand was exposed in his career caused the disease), plaintiff did establish that, during the time Mr. Rand worked with defendant’s product, the air was extremely dusty and that, when asbestos dust is visible, it necessarily implies an extreme exposure. <span title="293" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-293">p. 293</span>Plaintiff also established that each fiber which lodges in the lung causes asbestosis in the area around that fiber. Thus, reasonable minds could conclude that Mr. Rand inhaled asbestos fibers from defendant’s product and developed asbestosis. The only remaining issue, therefore, is whether the harm caused by defendant’s negligent conduct was a substantial factor in bringing about the disease which led to Mr. Rand’s death. While clearly a close question, we find that there was sufficient evidence in plaintiff’s favor to withstand a motion for a directed verdict. Evidence was presented which showed that Mr. Rand was heavily exposed to defendant’s product for six to nine months, that asbestos products were phased out in the early 1970’s, and that Mr. Rand was exposed to asbestos products only 50 percent of the time at work during the years from 1954-1962. This conclusion is supported by two federal court opinions dealing with the complex problem of proof in asbestosis cases: <i>Borel v. Fibreboard Paper Products Corp</i>, 493 F.2d 1076 (C.A. 5, 1973), <i>cert den</i> 419 U.S. 869; 42 L. Ed. 2d 107 (1974); <i>Migues v. Fibreboard Corp</i>, 662 F.2d 1182 (C.A. 5, 1981). We therefore find that the trial court properly denied defendant’s motion for a directed verdict.</p>

That court discussed the fact that the defendant might prevail if it could show that the fire it started was so small and insubstantial in comparison to the fire from the northwest quadrant of Chicago. This type of analysis gave rise to courts asking in such cases whether the defendant’s conduct was a “substantial factor” in causing the harm rather than a “but-for” factor in causing it. Some courts, as we will see in the next case, subsequently borrowed this test as their primary test for proximate cause rather than being used solely as a substitute test for actual cause. Used in either context, however, it is the same test.</p>

<p id="65c2f0d6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, the trial court determined as a matter of law that a property owner’s alleged negligence, even if proved, was not a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff’s loss. Therefore, the court sustained preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer to those counts of the plaintiff’s complaint which asserted liability on the part of the property owner. After careful review, we affirm.</p>

On June 27, 1988, between 1:30 and 2:30 a.m., a fire started in combustible trash and debris which had been allowed to accumulate on the premises. The fire spread across a narrow street and damaged premises…owned by Joseph A. Tartaglia and occupied for business purposes by JATCO, Inc. The fire burned for more than eight hours before being extinguished. Pursuant to a determination made by the City of Philadelphia, Thorne Equipment was engaged thereafter to demolish a six story elevator shaft on Tartaglia’s land. This elevator shaft, although still standing, had been damaged by the fire.

<p id="65c317f0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When these considerations are applied to the facts of the instant case, they demonstrate that even if Dorothy Gross had been negligent in allowing combustible trash to accumulate on her property, such accumulation was too far removed factually and chronologically from American’s harm to be a legal cause thereof. Gross’s negligence was passive and harmless until acted upon by an independent force. Moreover, the fire which erupted on her property was extinguished before any harm had occurred to American. The negligence for which she was responsible, if any, was not in active operation at the time when damages were caused to American’s property. Those damages were caused on the day following the fire because of the manner in which the fire-weakened elevator shaft was demolished by Thorne Equipment. Because the negligent <span title="296" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-296">p. 296</span>accumulation of combustible trash was too far removed from the damages to American’s property and because those damages were caused by the intervening act of the demolition contractor, it cannot be said legally or factually that the alleged negligence of Dorothy Gross was a substantial factor in causing harm to American.</p>
<p id="65c317f1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Ford v. Jeffries</i>, 379 A.2d 111 (Pa. 1977), the Supreme Court held that it was for the jury to determine whether a property owner’s negligence in maintaining his property in a state of disrepair was a substantial factor in causing the harm to a neighbor’s property damaged by fire originating on the original owner’s property. In the instant case, however, American’s property damage was not caused by a spreading fire. It was caused, rather, by the demolition of a fire damaged grain elevator after the fire had been extinguished. This demolition constituted an independent agency. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court correctly determined that Dorothy Gross, as a matter of law, was not legally responsible for appellant’s harm.</p>

<p id="65c317f5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Actual and Proximate Cause</i>.</b> In <i>Thorne,</i> the court does not discuss actual cause, apparently because defendant Dorothy Gross did not contest that type of required causation. Do you understand how Gross’s alleged negligence in letting the fire start would be considered an actual but-for cause of the plaintiff’s property damage? If there had never been the fire, would there have been any demolition of the elevator shaft? And if there had been no demolition, would plaintiff’s property have been hurt? Once actual causation is satisfied, however, the court has to address the challenged requirement of proximate or legal causation. This court employed the <i>substantial factor</i> test as its primary test for proximate cause. How does the court analyze the three considerations under Restatement (Second) §433 in concluding as a matter of law that Gross’s negligence was not a proximate cause of the plaintiff’s harm?</p>
<p id="65c317f6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Commingling of Tests</i>.</b> If this choice of three different tests is not confusing enough, be forewarned that there are some courts in some jurisdictions that use more than one test for proximate cause at the same time. In such jurisdictions, for example ones that require that a cause be both a foreseeable cause of the harm and a substantial factor in bringing about the harm, would having to clear more than one proximate cause hurdle be something that would tend to favor plaintiffs or defendants? Recall who has the burden of proof on this issue.</p>
<p id="65c317f7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Restatement (Third) View</i>.</b> The relatively recent Restatement (Third) states a preference for what’s referred to as a “risk standard” test for proximate <span title="297" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-297">p. 297</span>cause: “An actor’s liability is limited to those physical harms that result from the risks that made the actor’s conduct tortious.” §29 (2011). Comment d to §29 further indicates that the test is designed to prevent the imposition of liability by “confining liability’s scope to the reasons for holding the actor liable in the first place.” If you think this sounds an awful lot like the foreseeability test for proximate cause, you are not alone. This is acknowledged in the drafts of the Third Restatement:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65c317f8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Properly understood, both the risk standard and a foreseeability test exclude liability for harms that were sufficiently unforeseeable at the time of the actor’s tortious conduct that they were not among the risks—potential harms—that made the actor negligent.…[W]hen scope of liability arises in a negligence case, the risks that make an actor negligent are limited to foreseeable ones, and the factfinder must determine whether the type of harm that occurred is among those reasonably foreseeable potential harms that made the actor’s conduct negligent.</p>

<p id="65c317f9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">§29, cmt. j (2011). Thus, despite the change in semantics, the Third Restatement has in reality simply indicated a preference for the traditional foreseeability test for proximate cause.</p>
<p id="65c317fa-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Problem</i>.</b> Again, as a bit of review of the different tests we have seen for proximate cause, how would proximate cause be analyzed using the facts from <i>Thorne</i> in jurisdictions utilizing as their proximate cause test, (a) the direct cause test; and (b) the foreseeability test? Does one test seem to be easier to resolve in a rather definitive manner than the other test? What does this say about the benefits or weaknesses about each of these tests?</p>

<p id="65c33f0d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">In some cases, there is a final potential way that the plaintiff’s effort to prove causation in a negligence claim can be derailed. Even though a plaintiff has proven that defendant’s negligence was a factual but-for cause of her harm, and even though the plaintiff has been able to satisfy the jurisdiction’s test for proximate cause, defendant might still be able to argue that a <i>superseding cause</i> puts a fatal kink in the chain of causation. A superseding cause is a third party’s intervening act (occurring after the defendant’s negligence) that was not reasonably foreseeable from the standpoint of the defendant. In <i>Price</i>, the court discusses and applies this test for distinguishing between a mere intervening cause and a fatal superseding cause. The <i>McCane-Sondock</i> case involves a court applying this same test in the context of an intentional crime as the intervening act. In each case the defendant argues that intentional misconduct by a third-party that intervened should cut off causation. As you read the following cases, pay close attention to how this test for superseding versus intervening causes has a different focal point than the foreseeability test for proximate cause.</p>

<p id="65c33f14-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant Thomas Price filed an action sounding in…negligence as a result of injuries sustained when he was wearing a large manufactured “head” and was pushed or fell to the floor in a Reno club. The district court found that Price’s injuries resulted from a supervening cause and entered summary judgment against him. We conclude that material factual issues precluded summary judgment and therefore reverse.</p>
<p id="65c33f15-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thomas Price filed an action…against Blaine Kern Artista, Inc. (“BKA”), a Louisiana corporation that manufactures oversized masks in the form of caricatures resembling various celebrities and characters (hereafter “caricature mask”). The caricature mask covers the entire head of the wearer. Price alleged in his complaint that the caricature mask of George Bush which he wore during employment as an entertainer at Harrah’s Club in Reno was defective due to the absence of a safety harness to support his head and neck under the heavy weight. He also alleged that his injury occurred when a Harrah’s patron pushed him from behind, causing the weight of the caricature mask to strain and injure his neck as he fell to the ground.</p>
<p id="65c33f16-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On BKA’s motion for summary judgment, the district court determined that the patron’s push that precipitated Price’s fall constituted an unforeseeable superseding cause absolving BKA of liability.</p>
<p id="65c33f17-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The focal point of this appeal is whether the unknown assailant’s push that caused Price to fall to the ground is an intervening, superseding cause of Price’s injuries, insulating BKA from liability.…</p>
<p id="65c33f18-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Price argues that legal causation is a question of fact to be decided by the trier of fact and that an intervening criminal or tortious act by a third party does not necessarily preclude liability as a matter of law. In so arguing, however, he concedes (rather improvidently, we suggest) that BKA, a Louisiana corporation, could not reasonably be expected to have foreseen an attack on a user of one of its products by a third-party assailant in Reno, Nevada, and relies exclusively on the prospect that a jury might reasonably infer that a performer wearing a top-heavy, oversized caricature mask may stumble, trip, be pushed, or become imbalanced for numerous reasons. That same jury, according to Price, may find that BKA proximately caused Price’s injury due to its failure to equip the caricature mask of our former President with a safety harness.</p>
<p id="65c33f19-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">BKA first counters that legal causation, although normally a jury issue, may nevertheless be resolved summarily in appropriate cases when there is no genuine issue of material fact on the issue of foreseeability. BKA next argues that this is an appropriate case for summary judgment because, by Price’s own admission, the third-party attack forming the basis of his complaint was not foreseeable to BKA, and is thus a superseding cause of Price’s injuries.</p>

<p id="65c33f1a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Contrary to BKA’s assertions, we conclude for two reasons that genuine issues of material fact remain with respect to the issue of legal causation.</p>
<p id="65c3662b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[W]ith respect to the negligence claim, while it is true that criminal or tortious third-party conduct typically severs the chain of proximate causation between a plaintiff and a defendant, the chain remains unbroken when the third party’s intervening intentional act is reasonably foreseeable. Under the circumstances of this case, the trier of fact could reasonably find that BKA should have foreseen the possibility or probability of some sort of violent reaction, such as pushing, by intoxicated or politically volatile persons, ignited by the sight of an oversized caricature of a prominent political figure. We certainly cannot preclude such an inference as a matter of law and decline to penalize Price for his attorney’s lack of acuity in conceding this issue. Indeed, while the precise force that caused Price’s fall is uncertain, shortly before the fall, an irate and perhaps somewhat confused patron of Harrah’s took issue with the bedecked Price over Bush’s policy on abortion rights.</p>
<p id="65c3662c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the reasons discussed above, we conclude that a genuine issue of material fact remains with respect to the issue of the legal and proximate cause of Price’s injuries.

In this scenario, the intervening act being analyzed comes after the plaintiff’s initial injury and serves to aggravate those injuries. What if the doctor commits medical malpractice and this aggravates the initial injury caused by the defendant? Does the act by the doctor constitute an unforeseeable intervening act—a superseding cause—so that the defendant is not liable for the exacerbation of the injury? Courts typically treat this as a fact question. But generally courts hold that the mere fact that the doctor’s treatment fell below the duty of care does not necessarily cut off or reduce the defendant’s liability because a doctor’s negligence can be foreseeable:</p>

As you might imagine, the thief might be difficult to either sue or to collect from on a judgment. In many instances, the aggrieved plaintiff sues instead the owner of the stolen vehicle arguing that their negligence (e.g., leaving the keys in the unlocked vehicle) was a legal cause of the accident. The defendant owners have often raised the issue of superseding cause. Most courts have been friendly toward this defense, citing either no duty, no proximate cause, or superseding cause as the reason to deny recovery:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65c3b368-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[A] substantial number of courts have not held owners liable for leaving the keys in their unattended vehicles and for the injuries to third persons as a result of the thefts and subsequent negligent operation of those vehicles. Those courts have concluded either that an owner owes no duty to the general public to guard against the risk of a thief’s negligent operation of a vehicle…; that the theft and subsequent negligence of the thief could not reasonably be foreseen by the owner…; or…because the thief’s actions constituted an independent, intervening cause.</p>
</div>
<p id="65c3b369-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">McClenahan v. Cooley, 806 S.W.2d 767, 773 (Tenn. 1991) (quoting Prosser and Keeton, The Law of Torts, §44 (5th ed. 1984). The <i>Cooley</i> court said the issue <span title="302" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-302">p. 302</span>should be analyzed as one of intervening versus superseding cause. It concluded that, at least when the accident happens shortly after the theft, there is a jury question on whether the actions of the thief could be reasonably foreseeable. It refused to affirm summary judgment for the car owner. In Chapter 6, Special Duty Rules, we will see this same scenario in <i>Moody v. Delta Western</i> (introducing the firefighter rule, but not discussing the proximate cause dilemma).</p>

But would it make any sense in a direct cause jurisdiction to consider whether an intervening act is a superseding cause? After all, any independent, intervening act by a third-party negates proximate causation anyway. Asked another way, in a direct cause jurisdiction would the alarm company defendant in <i>McClane-Sondock</i> necessarily win? Do you see any room for argument by the plaintiff in a direct cause case to hold the alarm company liable as the legal cause of its harm? Consider the indispensible relationship between the alarm company’s negligent conduct and the ability of the burglar to commit his intentional act of stealing from the plaintiff. Do you see how one appears to be dependent on the other, rather than constituting an <i>independent</i> intervening act?</p>

<p id="65c3b36d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">The law of torts could dispense with the complexities of proximate cause if we were prepared to dispense justice with no concern for fairness. We could hold people liable for remote acts of negligence that caused unforeseeable ripples around the world decades after the fact. The only limitation on liability would be the courts’ ability to perceive but-for causation. But there seems to be universal agreement that this is untenable when we are dealing with accidental injuries. So the trick becomes finding a way to articulate at what point we draw a line in the sand and say, “no more.” As Judge Andrews observed in his famous dissent in <i>Palsgraf</i>, “[w]e may regret that the line was drawn just where it was, but drawn somewhere it had to be.…The words we used were simply indicative of our notions of public policy.…”</p>
<p id="65c3b36e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most courts choose between one of three tests for proximate cause, with the prevailing view preferring the test of <i>foreseeability</i>. After considering the foreseeable scope of harm in determining whether a defendant’s conduct is careless, we then ask whether the nature of the accident is what we feared might happen all along. If so, then proximate cause exists even though all of the precise details might not have been foreseen. In days past, the <i>direct</i> test was more in fashion, though it is still used even today <span title="303" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-303">p. 303</span>at times. Unlike the foreseeability test, which focuses upon whether the nature of the final accident was foreseeable, the direct test focuses instead upon whether any independent, intervening acts broke the chain of causation—foreseeability is not relevant to this analysis. Finally, some courts have adopted the <i>substantial factor</i> test, which considers issues of time, the number of other factors, and to what extent the defendant’s carelessness unleashed a force still active when the plaintiff was harmed. Particularly in foreseeability and substantial factor jurisdictions, even if the applicable test is satisfied, in appropriate cases the defendant might still prevail by proving that an unforeseeable intervening act has made it unfair to impose liability on the defendant.</p>
<p id="65c3b36f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When all three tests are easily satisfied, there likely is not a very significant proximate cause issue in the case; this is very common. But when application of different proximate cause tests yields different conclusions, this is indicative of a very serious proximate cause challenge to the plaintiff’s ability to hold the negligent actor liable. Considerable attention—whether on your torts final or in handling a lawsuit—is likely warranted on the matter. Whether proximate cause truly is the “ultimate issue” in a torts case likely varies with the circumstances of each case. But mastering the subject is highly useful.</p>

<p id="65c3b375-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Wheels, Inc. is a manufacturer of automobile tires and rims. It supplies tires and rims in large quantities to Fjord Motors, a Norwegian automobile manufacturer. To save money and boost profits, Wheels laid off all of its quality control inspectors at its manufacturing facility. As a result, certain units of a particular model rim were shipped to Fjord despite hairline cracks that were too small to be seen by the unaided eye, but could have been revealed using an x-ray machine that other <span title="304" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-304">p. 304</span>rim manufacturers typically use for this purpose. Wheels actually has the x-ray equipment and used to have a policy to inspect by x-ray each rim before it was shipped, but this practice had to stop due to the layoffs. Fjord was not told of this change in practice, was unaware of the hairline cracks in the rims, and went ahead and used them on many of its cars that were produced at this time.</p>
<p id="65c3b376-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Juan was a new purchaser of one of the Fjords that received a defective wheel rim. He was headed to the office, speeding at an excessive rate on the interstate freeway one sunny morning when the crack on his rim suddenly caused a complete wheel failure and his wheel came off the Fjord. Because he was running late, rather than try to pull to the side, he gripped the steering wheel hard, maintained his speed, and tried to keep going. But his efforts to control the car were in vain and a few seconds later he completely lost control of his Fjord. As he swerved from his lane of traffic, another car (driven by Roxanne) tried to pass him rather than slowing. As a result, Juan and Roxanne ran into each other, and they both spun out of control, coming to a stop in the middle lane of the freeway, blocking much of the traffic behind them. Roxanne was only mildly hurt, but the delay occasioned by the crash caused her to miss an important business meeting and she was fired from her job later that day. One of the vehicles coming up behind the accident scene a few minutes later was a truck filled with frozen meats. The driver of the truck, Frank, was distracted while texting on his cellphone and failed to notice the stoppage on the freeway. As a result, Frank crashed into the back of another car that had just come to a stop ahead of him due to the crash between Juan and Roxanne. This caused significant property damage to the car. The truck was also disabled because the front-end damage hurt its engine. The truck was stalled for hours due to both the engine problems and the delays the public authorities had in cleaning up the damaged vehicles belonging to Juan and Roxanne. Also, because the engine was not running on the truck, the refrigeration unit was also shut down and the entire shipment of frozen meat thawed and was ruined.</p>

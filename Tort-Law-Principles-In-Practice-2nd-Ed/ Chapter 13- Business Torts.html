<p id="66314251-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">The claims we have studied thus far involve torts that manifest themselves chiefly in terms of causing personal injuries or property damage rather than purely economic injuries. Assaults, batteries, false imprisonments, defamation, and product liability claims typically involve harm to the claimant’s body and/or mind. Trespass and conversion involve harm to the claimant’s property. And negligence can give rise to either type of physical injury—to one’s body or property. In any of these various claims there may also be economic injuries (i.e., special damages) but those are secondary to the physical harm caused by the tort. For example, a woman physically injured in a car accident may also be unable to work for some period of time and lose income. Were we to end our coverage of tort law at this point, we would be missing a whole branch of tort law involving misconduct arising in business transactions that results in purely economic harms.</p>
<p id="66314252-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A burgeoning area of tort law involves the common law’s adoption and application of tort claims that tend to arise in business transactions. The losses in these circumstances typically involve financial injury alone. There are many such tort causes of action and, indeed, there are entire elective classes in law schools devoted to exploring the nuances of the many types of common law business torts. For brevity’s sake, we will confine ourselves to an introduction to some of the stalwart theories of recovery in this field—fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and tortious interference with contract or prospective business relations. We will conclude, finally, with consideration of a key issue that can arise in many business tort cases—when the defendant’s actionable conduct that gives rise to the tort claim also involves the breach of an agreement, should <span title="880" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-880">p. 880</span>the court recognize a tort claim or limit the scope of the action to a breach of contract recovery? In this manner, we ironically end up coming full circle with the beginning of this textbook. We will conclude with the question, “What is a tort?”</p>

<p id="66316965-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Fraud is an ancient tort—at one time called an action for <i>deceit</i>—that is designed to protect the integrity of business transactions. The right to recover for fraud is premised upon the notion of a right to trust or rely upon certain statements or assurances from others. Fraud is recognized across many areas of the law and can yield varying remedies and results. In a breach of contract action, for example, a defendant might plead fraud as an affirmative defense to enforcement of the obligation. In a federal bankruptcy matter, a creditor might prove a fraudulent transaction as a basis to avoid the extinguishment of the debtor’s liability. We saw in Chapter 7, Affirmative Defenses, that fraudulent concealment can be pled as a way to escape the impact of a statute of limitations or statute of repose defense. Fraud can also be used affirmatively to seek a rescission of a contract. Our focus will be upon a claimant pleading the tort claim of common law fraud in an effort to recover for economic losses associated with a business transaction.</p>

<p id="66316968-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">All fraud claims involve proof of a misrepresentation by the defendant to the plaintiff, typically to induce the plaintiff into entering a contract. Of course, many sales pitches involve nuanced representations that might be called into question long after the consummation of a business deal. Courts are sensitive to not allowing “buyer’s remorse” to give rise to easy claims for fraud and, therefore, the commonly understood elements of a fraud claim take this hesitation into account. There are volumes of case reporters filled with opinions trying to determine if the defendant’s words or actions might be considered an actionable <span title="881" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-881">p. 881</span>misrepresentation. We will begin our foray into fraud by examining different types of misrepresentation that can be considered fraudulent.</p>

After the jury returned its answers to the special issues, both parties moved for judgment on the verdict, and Ratcliff, in the alternative, filed a motion for judgment <i>non obstante veredicto</i>. The trial court rendered judgment for Ratcliff, and rendered a take nothing judgment against Trenholm. The court of appeals affirmed the judgment, holding the evidence established, as a matter of law, that Trenholm did not rely on Ratcliff’s representations. We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and render judgment for plaintiff Trenholm.</p>
<p id="66319089-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">George and Robert Trenholm were the principal stockholders in Oxford Building Systems, a corporation engaged in the building of custom homes. Robert sold his interest to George prior to the filing of this lawsuit. Respondent, Raymond Ratcliff is the principal owner of Ratcliff Investments and Ramahal Development Corporation.</p>
<p id="6631908a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ratcliff, a land developer, entered into a joint venture agreement with Richardson Savings &amp; Loan to develop and sell lots in the Greenhollow subdivision <span title="882" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-882">p. 882</span>in West Plano, Texas. In November 1975, Ratcliff held a “draw meeting” to solicit local builders. The meeting was attended by several builders, including George Trenholm. At the meeting Ratcliff discussed the Greenhollow development, and invited the builders to purchase lots in the subdivision. During the presentation, Ratcliff stated a mobile home park located near Greenhollow would be a future shopping center. At the conclusion of his presentation, Ratcliff invited questions. George Trenholm asked:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="6631908b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Ray, you talked in, around and about this mobile home park through your presentation, and you definitely left me with the impression that its going to be moved, but before I buy any lots I specifically want to know what disposition is going to be made on that property.</p></div>
<p id="6631908c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Ratcliff answered:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="6631908d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Don’t worry about it, that’s zoned commercial, and that property has already been sold. Those people have been notified that their leases will not be renewed, so the park should close up sometime in April and after that, why, after they get everything moved out over there, they will come in and bulldoze it down so by June or July it will be like there’s never been a park there, and that will coincide actually just fine with the grand opening out there.</p></div>
<p id="6631908e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Trenholm built eighteen houses in the Greenhollow development. Six houses were built for his account, and twelve were built pursuant to a joint venture with Richardson Savings &amp; Loan. Richardson Savings &amp; Loan would furnish the money, and Trenholm would build and sell the houses. The profits or losses of the joint venture would be split 50/50 between them.</p>
<p id="6631908f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The mobile home park was not owned by Ratcliff or by Richardson Savings &amp; Loan, but rather by a third party. The mobile home park was not moved by the time the houses were completed for sale. The Greenhollow subdivision did poorly, and on June 23, 1976, a meeting was held by Ratcliff to discuss the slow sales. Trenholm asked about the continued presence of the mobile home park, and he was told that the park would not be moved. The houses were ultimately sold at a net loss, and Trenholm settled his joint venture losses with Richardson Savings &amp; Loan.</p>
<p id="66319090-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the trial for common law fraud the jury found: (1) that Ratcliff made false representations to Trenholm as to material facts with the intent to induce Trenholm to purchase Greenhollow lots, and which were relied on by Trenholm; (2) that the representations concerning the trailer park were not known by Ratcliff to be false, but were made recklessly and with a purported special knowledge; (3) that the false representations were made with malice; (4) that Trenholm did not waive his claim against Ratcliff; (5) that Trenholm could not have discovered the falsity of the false representation by reasonable investigation; (6) that Trenholm suffered $68,750 out-of-pocket losses on the six Oxford homes, $37,500 lost net profits on the twelve joint venture homes and $37,500 lost net profits on the <span title="883" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-883">p. 883</span>Oxford homes; and (7) that $250,000 exemplary damages should be awarded. Both parties moved for judgment on the verdict. Ratcliff contended the jury’s finding of recklessness would not support a cause of action for fraud. In the alternative, Ratcliff asked for judgment <i>non obstante veredicto</i>. The trial court rendered judgment for Ratcliff and that Trenholm take nothing.</p>
<p id="6631b7a1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court’s take nothing judgment, as we construe it, was based on one of two grounds: that a finding of recklessness would not support a cause of action for fraud concerning a future prediction, or that there was no evidence to support the jury findings in Trenholm’s favor.</p>
<p id="6631b7a2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ratcliff contends the necessary elements of a common law fraud action have not been established, and therefore, the jury verdict does not support a judgment for Trenholm. The elements of actionable fraud in Texas were stated in <i>Wilson v. Jones</i>, 45 S.W.2d 572, 574 (Tex. Comm. App. 1932, holding app’d) as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="6631b7a3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">(1) that a material representation was made; (2) that it was false; (3) that, when the speaker made it, he knew it was false or made it recklessly without any knowledge of its truth and as a positive assertion; (4) that he made it with the intention that it should be acted upon by the party; (5) that the party acted in reliance upon it; and (6) that he thereby suffered injury.</p></div>
<p id="6631b7a4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ratcliff argues the “trailer park representations” are matters of opinion or predictions of future events, and therefore, Trenholm must prove that Ratcliff knew they were false at the time they were made. The jury, in answer to special issue number two did not find that Ratcliff knew his representations were false. Ratcliff argues, therefore, he could not and did not make fraudulent representations.</p>
<p id="6631b7a5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Pure expressions of opinion are not actionable. It has been held that a representation, to be actionable, must be a representation of a material fact. <i>Wilson v. Jones, supra</i> at 574; W. Prosser, <i>Law of Torts</i> §109 at p. 720-724 (4th ed. 1971). There are exceptions to this general rule that an expression of an opinion cannot support an action for fraud. An opinion may constitute fraud if the speaker has knowledge of its falsity. An expression of an opinion as to the happening of a future event may also constitute fraud where the speaker purports to have special knowledge of facts that will occur or exist in the future. Additionally, when an opinion is based on past or present facts, an action for fraud may be maintained. Thus, the Texas courts have held a jury finding of recklessness or special knowledge establishes a basis for fraud in the last two exceptions.</p>
<p id="6631b7a6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ratcliff’s representation was not merely an expression of an opinion that the trailer park would be moved in the future. He falsely represented that the trailer park had been sold, and that notices had been given to the tenants. These are direct representations of present facts, which are so intertwined with his future prediction that the whole statement amounts to a representation of facts. A jury finding of recklessness is sufficient to establish a basis for misrepresentation of facts.</p>

<p id="6631b7a9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Elements of Fraud</i>.</b> Most courts have long agreed the basic elements of a fraud consist of the following: (a) a material misrepresentation, (b) falsity, (c) that was made with knowledge of the falsity or in reckless disregard of the truth, (d) intending for the plaintiff to rely upon the misrepresentation, (e) actual and justifiable (or reasonable) reliance by the plaintiff, and (f) actual harm suffered by the plaintiff in relying upon the misrepresentation. Courts adopted this cause of action with business transactions in mind, though occasionally you can find a court willing to consider its application to claims for personal injury. <i>See generally</i> Jane Doe v. Elizabeth Dilling, 888 N.E.2d 24 (Ill. 2008) (discussing the possible application of fraud to a fiancée’s contracting HIV). The primary issues in the foregoing <i>Trenholm</i> case were whether an actionable misrepresentation had occurred and whether recklessness would suffice as adequate mens rea. How did the court resolve those concerns?</p>
<p id="6631b7aa-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Scienter Needed for Fraud</i>.</b> Traditionally courts state that the scienter necessary to hold a defendant liable for damages in a fraud case involves either knowledge of the falsity of the representation or recklessness regarding the issue of falsity. As you may recall from Chapter 12, Defamation, this is what is referred to as <i>actual malice</i> in the context of the First Amendment’s application to libel and slander actions involving public officials and public figures. Proof of knowledge of falsity often involves circumstantial proof of information, or other statements by the defendant, such that the jury can conclude that the defendant must have known that his representation was untrue at the time of making it. With regard to the alternative standard of recklessness, proof that the defendant had sufficient information available at the time of making the representation to cast significant doubt on the truth of the statement can be considered adequate to uphold a jury verdict. Lacking evidence to support either form of scienter, a claimant might consider negligent misrepresentation, covered in the next section of this chapter, as a possible alternative claim.</p>
<p id="6631b7ab-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Availability of Punitive Damages</i>.</b> Because the common law requires proof of the defendant stating a known falsehood or being reckless about it, courts have long allowed juries to consider punitive damages in common law fraud actions. Perhaps fearing that it was too easy to allege a misrepresentation and to engage in punitive damage discovery, the drafters of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9 (governing the pleading of fraud claims) have required that claims for fraud be plead with “particularity.” This is typically considered to include pleading the specific misrepresentation, the name and circumstances of the speaker making the statement, the facts demonstrating why the statement was false, as well as the other elements of the claim. What is it <span title="885" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-885">p. 885</span>about an act of fraud that has led courts to universally permit punitive damages when it is proven?</p>
<p id="6631debc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Opinions vs. Facts</i>.</b> As the court discusses in <i>Trenholm</i>, courts have also been willing in the right context to permit a fraud claim based upon a misrepresented opinion, but these are limited to specific varieties: (a) false opinion as to future events when the speaker claims to have special insight, (b) opinions given that are insincere, and (c) opinions that are premised upon past or present facts when these underlying facts are false. Which of these was involved in <i>Trenholm</i>? Outside of these three exceptional categories, courts reject fraud claims that are premised solely upon pure opinions stated by the defendant. What is it about an opinion that would lead to this conclusion?</p>
<p id="6631debd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. <i>Puffery as a Form of Opinion</i>.</b> Sometimes the defendant is sued for making statements designed to “puff up” the perceived value of the subject of the contemplated transaction. The use of adjectives in the negotiations often leads to inquiry as to whether the statements could be considered potentially false statements of fact or mere opinions that should not be actionable. Use of phrases such as “fine,” “first-class,” “land of gold,” “a hot buy,” a “good one,” “excellent,” and “perfect” raise such an issue. If the court concludes that the statement is a mere opinion, it will refer to it as “puffery” and dismiss the fraud claim. <i>See e.g.</i>, Miller v. William Chevrolet, 762 N.E.2d 1 (Ill. App. Ct. 2001) (“puffing is defined as a bare and naked statement as to value of a product and is considered a nonactionable assertion of opinion”). Frankly, a survey of cases involving this issue reveals courts within the same jurisdictions that are often inconsistent in analyzing such adjectives. <i>Compare, e.g.</i>, Pennington v. Singleton, 606 S.W.2d 682 (Tex. 1980) (“excellent” was a representation of fact), <i>with</i> Buckingham v. Thompson, 135 S.W. 652 (Tex. Civ. App. 1911, no writ) (“good one” was mere puffery). In cases where there is doubt as to whether the representation amounted to a factual statement or puffery, the court will submit the issue to a jury with an instruction along the lines that “puffery is an expression of opinion by a seller not made as a representation of fact.” One scholar lamented the lack of a coherent legal analysis of this issue:</p>

<p id="663205de-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is an action in fraud in which the defendant is charged by the plaintiff with concealing defects in an automobile, which he traded to plaintiff in part payment of the purchase price of a new car, which the plaintiff sold to him. The trial was to the court, which found for the plaintiff in the sum of $759.00 and costs. After an unavailing motion for a new trial, the defendant appealed.</p>
<p id="663205df-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff company was engaged in the sale of automobiles. Its business was located in the City of St. Louis. The defendant was in the vending machine business in St. Louis. He had some trucks and a Cadillac and Imperial automobiles, which he used in connection with his business.</p>
<p id="663205e0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">He decided to trade in his 1957 Imperial on another Cadillac. In June of 1959 the Imperial was brought into the plaintiff’s place of business and was appraised by the sales manager in charge of such work. He examined the automobile and appraised its value to be $2,165 at that time. No deal was made then because the parties were unable to reach a trade-in figure that was agreeable to both.</p>
<p id="663205e1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the month of October, 1959, during a cold spell, the coolant in the Imperial froze. The car was taken to a filling station which Aron, the defendant, patronized. According to the testimony of the filling station operator, defendant told him that the motor had frozen and he wanted it checked to see if it had cracked. The filling station operator thawed out the motor and placed the car on a grease rack to check it over. He testified that he found two cracks on each side of the motor block. He said that the told Aron, the defendant, that the block was cracked. He estimated the cost of a new block to be in the neighborhood of four or five hundred dollars. He told Aron that he could put a “K and W sealer” in the cracks, but that it would be “strictly temporary.” He also suggested that if the car was to be traded in, the cracks filled with the sealer could be covered with Permatex, which would conceal the filled cracks. Permatex is a gasket sealer and could serve no purpose other than to conceal the filled cracks in the motor block. He said that Aron told him to do this work, and that he did a “pretty smooth job” and that the Permatex concealed the cracks.</p>
<p id="663205e2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">About the 20th of November, 1959, Aron drove the Imperial into the Lindberg Cadillac Company’s service department for appraisal as a trade-in. It was there about half an hour, and he then drove it away. Aron had not driven the Imperial after the crack sealer was put in until the time he drove it to the plaintiff’s place of business for the purpose of a trade-in. Defendant Aron testified that he discussed the condition of the Imperial in plaintiff’s office when they were attempting to close the deal. He said that they agreed that it needed floor mats, that the motor was leaking oil and needed repair, and that the fenders needed fixing. He did not tell either the salesman or the sales manager about the cracked block. Thus the car which had been appraised in June was reappraised on November 20th, and an agreement was eventually reached to <span title="888" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-888">p. 888</span>allow $2,290 for the Imperial on the purchase price of a new Cadillac. There was testimony that the actual value of the Imperial as traded in, assuming that the block was not cracked, was appraised at $1,720.00, and $259.00 was later spent by the plaintiff on reconditioning it for sale. There was also testimony that the book value of the car was $1,979.00.</p>
<p id="663205e3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The sales manager for the plaintiff company, who made the appraisal of the car, drove it for a few minutes on November 20th. He checked the heat gauge to see if it was overheating. This would normally disclose a cracked motor block. He also checked for water leaks, and found none. After the appraisal and sale, the car was reconditioned in the normal course of business for sale. This usually took about 30 days.</p>
<p id="663205e4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On December 21st, the Imperial as reconditioned was sold for $2,476.08. The purchaser returned the next day and complained that it was overheating. The car was taken to the plaintiff’s shop to verify the purchaser’s complaint. It was found that the motor block had the cracks in it, and the plaintiff refunded to the purchaser the money he had paid for the car. The plaintiff then sold the Imperial, known to the buyer to have a cracked motor block, for $1,200.</p>
<p id="663205e5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant, testifying in his own behalf, said that he did not know what a motor block was. He said that when the Imperial was frozen, he took it to the filling station because they were supposed to have put anti-freeze in the radiator. He testified that the station attendant said that he would take care of what was wrong, and kept the car for about a day. The attendant said nothing to him about the cracked motor block. He said that after he was informed of the cracked block by the plaintiff, he never went to the filling station attendant about the matter nor had any communication with him in relation to it. Defendant also testified that he had been sentenced to three and one-half years for counterfeiting cigarette tax stamps, and at the time of trial he was on probation for a period of seven years.</p>
<p id="66322cf6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As stated, the court found for the plaintiff in the sum of $759.00, and the defendant appealed.</p>
<p id="66322cf7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first point he raises is that the appellant failed to make a prima facie showing of fraud, and that the court should have found for the defendant. The appellant asserts in support of this that he made no misrepresentation, and that his mere silence cannot be held to have been fraudulent where the matter was open to investigation by the party alleged to have been defrauded. This constitutes a complete disregard of the facts. Silence can be an act of fraud. In one of our earliest cases, <i>McAdams v. Cates</i>, 24 Mo. 223, 225, our Supreme Court stated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="66322cf8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">If, in a contract of sale, the vendor knowingly allows the vendee to be deceived as to the thing sold in a material matter, his silence is grossly fraudulent in a moral point of view, and may be safely treated accordingly in the law tribunals of the country. Although he is not required to give the purchaser all the information he possesses himself, he can not be permitted to be silent when his silence operates virtually as a fraud. If he fails to disclose an intrinsic circumstance that is vital to the contract, knowing that the other party is acting upon the presumption that no such fact <span title="889" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-889">p. 889</span>exists, it would seem to be quite as much a fraud as if he had expressly denied it, or asserted the reverse, or used any artifice to conceal it, or to call off the buyer’s attention from it.</p></div>
<p id="66322cf9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The reason for the rule is that since matters are not what they appear to be and the true state of affairs is not discoverable by ordinary diligence, deceit is accomplished by suppression of the truth. 23 Am. Jur. Fraud and Deceit, §84, p. 863.</p>
<p id="66322cfa-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have in the facts before us more than a failure to speak. There is also a positive fraudulent concealment. In the case of <i>Jones v. West Side Buick Auto Co.</i>, 93 S.W.2d 1083, decided by this court, we had before us facts quite similar in effect to those here under consideration. There a fraudulent seller turned back the speedometer in the car sold to 22,400 miles, when the car had in fact been driven 48,800 miles. There was no verbal or written representation by the seller, but the buyer, relying upon the mileage registered on the speedometer, purchased the car. We held that the buyer had been defrauded by the deception, stating: “a representation is not confined to words or positive assertions; it may consist as well of deeds, acts, or artifices of a nature calculated to mislead another and thereby to allow the fraud-feasor to obtain an undue advantage over him.” See, also, <i>Hutchings v. Tipsword</i>, 363 Mo. App., 363 S.W.2d 40, 45. The acts of the defendant as stated above were designed to, and did, defraud the plaintiff, and there is no merit to the contention that a case in fraud was not made.</p>

<p id="66322cfd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">“In the present stage of the law, the decisions show a drawing away from this idea [that nondisclosure is not actionable], and there can be seen an attempt by many courts to reach a just result in so far as possible, but yet maintaining the degree of certainty which the law must have.”</p>

</div>
<p id="66322cff-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second point raised is that the court erred in its finding as to damages. The court reached the sum of $759.00 as damages by allowing $500.00 for the motor block and $259.00 for the sum spent by the plaintiff in reconditioning the car. It is asserted that the proper measure of damages is the difference between the actual value and the value the car would have had if the representation had been true. We agree that such generally is the proper measure of damages.</p>
<p id="66322d00-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In applying the rule we must consider the nature of the fraud committed as it reflects upon the value of the property as fraudulently represented. A trade was made here with the full knowledge that the car was to be reconditioned for sale. It was represented as a car that could be so reconditioned by certain minor repairs caused by normal use. It was known by the defendant that the expenditures that the plaintiff intended to make would not make the car serviceable for resale, as the car, after such repairs, could not honestly be sold for its intended use. The fact that the court, in reaching the amount of damages, found the cost of the block and the cost of the repairs to be the <span title="890" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-890">p. 890</span>total, was not erroneous, as both went to the value of the car as represented and its actual value.</p>
<p id="66322d01-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We find no error present, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>

<p id="66322d04-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Concealment as a Misrepresentation</i>.</b> In the above case the defendant tried to argue that mere silence would not support a fraud cause of action. Did the court agree that, at worst, the defendant could be accused of the sin of omission or failing to do something that would have placed the plaintiff in a more advantageous position? When did the court indicate that silence could still constitute a misrepresentation of the truth to justify a cause of action based upon deceit?</p>
<p id="66322d05-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Other Instances Where Silence Is Fraud</i>.</b> Most fraud claims permitted by courts involve affirmative statements proven to be false. The <i>Lindberg Cadillac</i> case involved an exception to this norm. Beyond active concealment of relevant information involved in the foregoing case, courts have also been willing to permit fraud claims when a defendant has been silent in circumstances where an affirmative duty to disclose is recognized. One such situation involves transactions entered into among those in a confidential or fiduciary relationship. For example, when one retains an attorney, an accountant, or a similar professional, courts typically hold that the professional owes a duty of loyalty to the client and is held to the utmost standard of fair dealing, including an affirmative obligation to disclose any material information before engaging in a transaction involving the client. Many other courts have also held that when one conveys partial information that creates a misleading impression, there is a duty triggered to supply the rest of the material information. In other words, a half-truth is a complete falsehood. Some courts have recognized a duty of the seller in the context of a real estate sale to affirmatively disclose material information about the real estate which the buyer would not otherwise be in a position to uncover. Finally, some courts have agreed with Restatement (Second) of Torts §551 (1965), which requires a general duty to disclose facts in a commercial setting when the defendant knows that the plaintiff is ignorant about the fact and does not have an equal opportunity to discover the truth. Many courts have refused to accept the Restatement’s potentially broad exception to the normal requirement of an affirmative misrepresentation. Because it is unclear when disclosure is required outside of special relationships, litigants and courts are often left with a “somewhat nebulous standard, praiseworthy as looking toward more stringent business ethics, but possibly difficult of practical application.” Note, <i>Fraudulent Concealment—Vendor &amp; Purchaser—Duty to Disclose</i>, 36 Wash. L. Rev. 202, 204 (1961).</p>
<span title="891" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-891">p. 891</span>
<p id="66325416-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Damages for Fraud</i>.</b> The <i>Lindberg Cadillac</i> court stated that the normal measure of damages in a fraud case was the difference in value between the subject of the transaction as represented versus its actual market value. While courts often utilize such measures, they have been quite flexible in permitting other calculations in a fraud case where justice demanded it. In fact, in <i>Lindberg Cadillac</i> the court also permitted recovery of some out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the plaintiff in getting the automobile ready for resale. In general, courts have recognized damages for the (1) out-of-pocket damages incurred by the victim, the (2) loss of the benefit of the bargain, (3) a restitution type of recovery designed to remove any unjust enrichment gained by the defendant from the fraud, as well as (4) other consequential damages not otherwise covered. There are some courts that have recognized emotional distress damages in certain fraud cases, but such recovery is not typical.</p>
<p id="66325417-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Materiality of Information</i>.</b> The common law only imposes liability for fraud when the misrepresentation is considered “material” to the parties’ transaction. <i>See</i> Restatement (Second) of Torts §538 (1965) (reliance upon fraudulent misrepresentation not justifiable unless the matter misrepresented is material). One issue that courts have had to consider is whether the issue of materiality should be resolved by resorting to an objective or subjective standard. For example, if most purchasers of defendant’s widget would not care about the color of the product (perhaps some piece of industrial equipment), should the defendant’s knowing falsehood that the crane was “bright yellow” when it was actually a dull mustard color still give rise to liability if the plaintiff attached considerable importance to the color of the equipment being purchased? Most courts have utilized an <i>objective measure</i> of materiality—whether reasonable people in the circumstance would have attached significance to the matter—except when the defendant has knowledge of the plaintiff’s own subjective view of the importance of the matter. As one court described the proposition, a representation is material if:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="66325418-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">A reasonable man would attach importance to its existence or nonexistence in determining his choice of action in the transaction in question; or the maker of the representation knows or has reason to know that its recipient regards or is likely to regard the matter as important in determining his choice of action, although a reasonable man would not so regard it.</p></div>

What if the defendant’s promise to perform is the fraudulent misrepresentation because the defendant never plans to perform as promised? Is this a mere broken promise—a breach of contract case—or is it fraud? For example, if the defendant agrees upon receipt of $10,000 to deliver an automobile to the plaintiff but instead takes the money (and the car) and drives to Canada, has the defendant committed a tort or just breached an agreement?

Finally, he alleges that A&amp;A “misrepresented, concealed or failed to disclose material facts including that it either did not have sufficient knowledge and/or experience in dealing with Czechoslovak laws and practices and/or that if it had adequate knowledge and/or experience with respect to same, that it would fail to utilize same.”</p>
<p id="66327b40-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A&amp;A has moved to dismiss [the fraud claim on the ground that it] simply alleges that A&amp;A made a false promise to perform under the contract, a promise which, it maintains, cannot, under New York law, convert a breach of contract claim into one for fraud. In response, Smehlik contends that the specific oral representations made by Hron, devised for the purpose of inducing him to enter into the agreement, included promises that went beyond A&amp;A’s general obligation under the written contract to “use its best efforts to secure offers” from the Sabres or other NHL clubs. He argues that under New York law, one who is fraudulently induced to enter into a contract may maintain a cause of action for fraud separate from his breach of contract cause of action, when the fraud allegations are, as he claims they are here, distinct from the breach of contract claim.</p>

<p id="66327b41-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is well established in the New York courts that when a plaintiff alleges both breach of contract and fraud, “[the] cause of action in fraud may be maintained where the allegations of wrongdoing are distinct from those giving rise to the breach of contract claim and relate to facts extraneous thereto.” <i>Steigerwald v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.</i>, 107 A.D.2d 1026 (N.Y. 4th Dept. 1985). A mere “promissory statement as to what will be done in the future” may give rise only to a breach of contract claim. <i>See Stewart v. Jackson and Nash</i>, 976 F.2d 86, 89 (2d Cir. 1992). However, a false representation of a present fact may give rise to a separable claim for fraudulent inducement, and generally speaking, if a promise is “made with a preconceived and undisclosed intention of not performing it, it constitutes a misrepresentation of material existing fact” upon which an action for fraudulent inducement may be predicated. Thus, it is clear that a cause of claim for fraudulent inducement may be sustained on the basis of an allegation that the defendant made a promise to undertake some action separate and apart from his obligations under the express terms of the contract, if it is also alleged that he made the promise with no intention of making good on that commitment.</p>
<p id="6632a252-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What is much less clear is whether a cause of action for fraud may properly be sustained on the basis of an allegation that the defendant made a promise to perform under the express terms of the contract while intending not to abide by its terms. The New York courts are split on this issue. <i>See Kenevan v. Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield</i>, 791 F. Supp. 75, 80 (S.D.N.Y. 1992); <i>Bower v. Weisman</i>, 650 F. Supp. 1415, 1422-1423 (S.D.N.Y. 1986). The Second Department has recently stated, for example, that where a fraud claim “is premised upon an alleged breach of contractual duties and the supporting allegations do not concern representations which are collateral or extraneous to the terms of the parties’ agreement, a cause of action sounding in fraud does not lie.” <i>McKernin v. Fanny Farmer Candy Shops, Inc.</i>, 176 A.D.2d 233, 574 N.Y.S.2d 58, 59 (2d Dept. 1991) (citing <i>Mastropieri v. Solmar Construction Co., Inc.</i>, 159 A.D.2d 698, 553 N.Y.S.2d 187 (2d Dept. 1990); <i>Tuck Industries, Inc. v. Reichhold Chemicals, Inc.</i>, 151 A.D.2d 565, 542 N.Y.S.2d 701 (2d Dept. 1989); <i>Manshul Construction Corp. v. City of New York</i>, 143 A.D.2d 333, 532 N.Y.S.2d 419 (2d Dept. 1988); <i>Edwil Industries, Inc. v. Stroba Instruments Corp.</i>, 131 A.D.2d 425, 516 N.Y.S.2d 233 (2d Dept. 1987); <i>Spellman v. Columbia Manicure Manufacturing Co., Inc.</i>, 111 A.D.2d 320, 489 N.Y.S.2d 304 (2d Dept. 1985)). The First Department takes a similar approach. See <i>Caniglia v. Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate, Inc.</i>, 612 N.Y.S.2d 146, 147 (1st Dept. 1994) (“a cause of action does not lie where…the only fraud alleged merely relates to a contracting party’s alleged intent to breach a contractual obligation”); <i>Comtomark, Inc. v. Satellite Communications Network, Inc.</i>, 116 A.D.2d 499, 497 N.Y.S.2d 371 (1st Dept. 1986). On the other hand, the Third Department has recently held that “a party who is fraudulently induced to enter a contract may join a cause of action for fraud with one for breach of the same contract” where the misrepresentations alleged are “misstatements of material fact or promises [to perform under the contract] made with a present, albeit undisclosed, intent not to perform them.” <i>Shlang v.

The claim was recognized as early as 1885 in the old English case of Edgington v. Fitzmaurice, 29 Ch. D. 459, where an investor was swindled through a promise that the directors would use his investment for a particular business purpose without ever so intending. The court found the directors liable based upon their lack of an intention to ever perform as promised. The court stated that:</p>

It is true that it is very difficult to prove what the state of man’s mind at a particular time is, but if it can be ascertained it is as much a fact [capable of being misrepresented] as anything else. A misrepresentation as to the state of a man’s mind is, therefore, a misstatement of fact.</p></div>

Similar to the insincere opinion that can count as a misrepresentation of fact, promissory fraud can be viewed as an insincere promise that misrepresents the defendant’s actual state of mind.

But where plaintiff can prove the lack of present intent to perform a promise, a tort cause of action for fraud will lie. Whether the claimant can sue on the contract only or also in tort can impact the applicable statute of limitations, the appropriate damages, whether a liquidated damage clause will govern, the scope of discovery and admissibility of certain evidence at trial, and the recovery of punitive damages.</p>
<p id="6632c974-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Evidence of Lack of Intent to Perform</i>.</b> In addition to the normal proof of the other elements of a fraud claim, a plaintiff in a promissory fraud claim must demonstrate that, at the time of making the enforceable promise, the defendant had no intention of performing as represented. While a failure to perform is circumstantial evidence supporting this finding, the failure to perform <i>alone</i> can never transform the breach of contract into a fraud claim. On the other hand, where the defendant denies the existence of the contract, this is strong evidence of a lack of intent to perform—assuming the jury finds the disputed agreement was made. Further, evidence that performance was not possible at the time the promise was made can be strong evidence in support of a promissory fraud claim.</p>

Despite the defendant lying to the plaintiff, if the plaintiff does not care about the challenged representation or does not rely upon that misinformation in choosing to transact business with the defendant, is there any reason to hold the defendant liable for fraud? Further, if the plaintiff is foolishly duped into entering the transaction should this provide a defense to the deceitful party? The court in the following case explores the concept of <i>justifiable reliance</i> as an additional element of a fraud cause of action and helps define when the intentional tortfeasor can rely upon the plaintiff’s own misconduct as a defense.</p>

Bourland resides at Pontiac, Illinois. The defendants, Walker and Naxera, reside in Buffalo township, Pike county, Missouri. Naxera owned two tracts of land in Pike county, Illinois. Walker was Naxera’s agent to sell them. Bourland was Judd’s agent to buy them. So acting, at a certain time Bourland purchased from Walker said tracts of Illinois land. Judd and Bourland were strangers in that vicinity and unfamiliar with the lands. Walker and Naxera were familiar with the lands and Walker made false representations as to the acreage. After the deed passed from Naxera to Judd, it was ascertained there was a serious discrepancy in the amount of land conveyed by the deed, whereby Judd paid over $1,000 for land he did not get and which Naxera did not own and knew he did not own. Thereupon Judd sued Naxera and Walker for damages [for] fraud and deceit.

<p id="6632f093-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">“This is an action at law on an allegation of fraud and deceit for the sale of lands. The evidence was to the effect that the plaintiff, Curtis J. Judd, treasurer of the Keeley Company of Dwight, Illinois, is a man of means and invests surplus money in lands. One Bourland, a banker of Pontiac, Illinois, and Mr. Judd have an arrangement whereby Bourland looks around for lands out of which money can be made by buying and reselling, and upon locating such lands, Mr. Judd furnishes the money and the land is purchased in the name of Judd as a speculation. The business is all done by Bourland, subject to Judd’s approval. On the occasion in question, Bourland, as agent of Judd, came to Louisiana, Missouri, in search of lands and met the defendant Walker, a real estate agent at that place, who drove him across the Mississippi river into Pike county, Illinois, and upon the lands of the defendant Naxera, which he then had for sale as agent for Naxera. The land was irregular in shape, being bounded on one side by the Sny and running to a dull point on the north end. Walker, Naxera’s agent, informed Bourland, Judd’s agent, that the two pieces of land which were adjacent and owned by Naxera, contained one hundred and seventy-eight acres, one piece containing eighty acres and the other ninety-eight acres, and offered the tract at forty dollars per acre. Bourland looked at the land and they then drove on and viewed other properties. Returning to Louisiana, both Bourland and one Sims, a friend of Bourland who was accompanying him on the trip, informed Walker that Bourland was acting for Judd and that he would wire Judd for consent to buy the Naxera lands, which he did and received Judd’s permission by wire, which was communicated to Walker. On the following day, Bourland drove to and upon the lands in order to locate a certain slough thereon, and that evening paid Walker $200 earnest money and entered into a contract in writing, whereby he agreed to purchase said lands as soon as Walker could procure satisfactory abstracts, conveyances, etc. At the time of executing this contract, Walker said he was not sure of the number of acres in excess of ninety in the irregular-shaped tract adjacent to the Sny and therefore they had better put in the contract the round number of ninety acres and would ascertain definitely thereafter. A month later Walker drew up a deed which was executed by his principal, Naxera, and acknowledged before Walker as a notary public, which deed purported to convey to Judd the two tracts of land mentioned, one hundred and seventy-eight acres, for which a draft payable to Walker, covering the balance due at $40 per acre, was delivered to the bank in payment therefor, and the deed was thereupon delivered to Judd.</p>

Some time thereafter, Judd caused the land to be surveyed, whereby it was ascertained that it contained 153.24 acres only, instead of one hundred and seventy-eight acres, there being a shortage of 24.76 acres. One witness also testified that between the time of the negotiation of the land and the making of the deed, Walker told him in his (Walker’s) office that Bourland was going to take the land and that he was getting paid for a number of acres, something like twenty-seven acres, more than there was in the tract. Upon this state of facts, this suit for fraud and deceit was instituted to recover this shortage at forty dollars per acre.”</p>

There are cases which hold that where the parties go upon the land during negotiations and the seller points out the true boundaries thereof to the purchaser, with the statement of the number of acres contained therein, and upon this statement of the acreage the purchaser relies and purchases the land, no action of deceit can be maintained by the injured party on account thereof. The reason assigned in these cases seems to be two-fold: first, that parties ought not rely on such statements; and, second, that the parties were upon the land and the means of information were equally open to both, therefore the rule <i>caveat emptor</i> applies, as the true number of acres could be ascertained by ordinary vigilance on the part of the purchaser.…After much careful and painstaking investigation, we are satisfied that the law is quite generally established throughout those jurisdictions where the common law obtains, to the effect that false statements and representations made by the vendor, positively as of his own knowledge, as to the number of acres in a certain tract of land when the tract is being negotiated by the acre, are not regarded as expressions of opinion, but on the contrary, are considered statements of fact, and as such constitute fraud.…This view has become almost universally recognized and adopted by the courts throughout the country. The generally accepted doctrine on the subject is thus announced in 14 Am. and Eng. Ency. Law (2 Ed.), 45: ‘There are some cases in which it has been held or said that a false statement as to the boundaries of a tract of land, or as to the number of acres which it contains, will not support an action of deceit, but they base the rule on the ground that such statements ought not to be relied upon, and not on the ground that they are expressions of opinion. Statements as to such matters, if made by a person positively, and as of his own knowledge, are statements of fact, and have often been held to constitute fraud.’</p>
<p id="6632f097-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“In fact, the rule announced above is the same which applies in cases of fraud and deceit generally and is to the effect that the party owning the property or article, is presumed to know the facts.

The evidence shows conclusively that Walker made positive representations to Bourland as to the number of acres in the tract from the inception of the trade up to the time of drawing the contract, at which time he suggested that as he was not sure of the exact number of acres in excess of ninety, they would call the irregular tract ninety acres in round numbers, leaving the impression that in the interim, prior to the making of the deed, he would ascertain the true acreage. Bourland relied upon what he said and trusted to him to make good his representations. Walker himself drew the deed for one hundred and seventy-eight acres, and procured his principal’s signature thereto by giving to him an obligation of indemnity as mentioned, and collected the cash for the full number of acres as represented by him in the first instance, knowing at the time that he was then and there perpetrating a heinous fraud upon the purchaser. It would seem that in a case of such gross deception a recovery should be had without much difficulty. The respondent contends, however, that inasmuch as Bourland went upon the land twice and viewed the same, the parties were then upon an equal footing, and means of knowledge being open to him, the rule of <i>caveat emptor</i> applies; that it was the purchaser’s duty to use his senses and vigilance and ascertain for himself the true facts, and not having done so, a recovery is precluded. The cases of <i>Mires v. Summerville</i>, <i>Mooney v. Miller</i>, <i>Gordon v. Parmelee</i>, and <i>Credle v. Swindell</i>, supra, are cited and relied upon as supporting this contention.</p>

It reconciles the claims of convenience with the duties of good faith, to every extent compatible with the interests of commerce. This it does by requiring the purchaser to apply his attention to those particulars which may be supposed within the <i>reach of his observation and judgment</i>; and the vendor to communicate those particulars and defects which cannot be supposed <i>to be immediately within the reach of such attention</i>. If the purchaser be wanting of attention to these points, where attention would have been sufficient to protect him from surprise or imposition, the maxim, <i>caveat emptor</i>, ought to apply.’ 2 Kent’s Comm. (14 Ed.), 484, 485.</p>
<p id="6632f09a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“The true test of the application of the rule <i>caveat emptor</i>, is the liability of the defect complained of to the observation and judgment of one exercising ordinary and usual business attention, care and circumspection, that is, such care and attention as is usually exercised by ordinarily prudent men in like business affairs. The law requires this much and no more. It does not require nor expect the purchaser to exercise a degree of care and prudence greater than business men ordinarily exercise in like transactions. The rule is a reasonable one and its chief purpose is to require men to see and know such things as are open and patent to their senses upon penalty. It is where the defect complained of is open and patent to the senses of one exercising ordinary business care and attention only that the rule of <i>caveat emptor</i> applies.…The rule mentioned has been carried to its full extent in <span title="901" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-901">p. 901</span>this State. In <i>Morse v. Rathburn</i>, 49 Mo. 91, the alleged false representations were that certain unimproved portions of the farms were well-timbered and that the soil was good, whereas most of the timber had been cut off and the land was broken and rocky. The plaintiff having been over the land during negotiations, the court very properly denied a recovery by the application of the rule aforesaid, on the ground that the matters and things about which the alleged false representations were made were open to the observation of the purchaser. To the same effect is the case of <i>McFarland v. Carver</i>, 34 Mo. 195, in which case the fraud and deceit alleged was as to certain representations regarding the quality of lands and it appeared that one hundred and twenty acres thereof were subject to overflow. The court held that if the defect was patent to observation, no recovery could be had therefor.</p>
<p id="663317ab-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Entertaining these views, we are fully persuaded that the case under consideration is not one where the rule should find application. To apply it here, we must find that the alleged shortage of acres in the tract was open and patent to the observation of the purchaser and within the range of his senses while viewing the lands. This we cannot do as it is a matter of common knowledge that a man cannot view a tract of land and arrive at anything like an accurate estimate of its contents. As said by the Supreme Court of Michigan: ‘It cannot be generally true that a person can judge of the contents of a piece of land by the eye.’ <i>Starkweather v. Benjamin</i>, 32 Mich. 305.</p>
<p id="663317ac-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“3. Considering the next proposition, that Bourland having viewed the lands, he should have used vigilance to ascertain the fact of acreage. To follow out this suggestion, a survey would have been necessary. The rule only requires that Bourland should use that degree of business circumspection usually exercised by prudent men in like transactions. This being true, he would be chargeable with neglect in that behalf only in event that prudent men usually cause surveys to be made under like circumstances. In dealing with this suggestion, we must apply a degree of common sense commensurate with the case in hand and view it in the light of common knowledge and every-day experience pertaining to like affairs. From these bearings, we all know that land in large tracts is bought and sold almost daily by the acre in this country without surveys. This arises no doubt from the fact that the original Government surveys are usually accurate and men rely thereon, together with the presumption usually indulged that he who owns the land knows the acreage, and the negotiations are generally had on the faith of prior surveys, and representation of the owner. The citizens of Missouri from time immemorial have been accustomed to deal with the utmost good faith in matters of this kind, and it would be a sad commentary indeed upon the moral sense and integrity of the State for the courts to say even by inference that our citizens can no longer be trusted in this behalf. Our conclusion is that in case of positive representation of a given number of acres in a tract, ordinary business prudence does not require a survey and measurement thereof and that the party relying upon such representations of fact is not precluded from recovery by not causing measurements to be made in advance of the purchase.</p>

The general rule seems to be well settled that where the parties deal fairly or at arm’s length, the rule of <i>caveat emptor</i> as above indicated applies, but when fair dealing is departed from by the vendor making false statements of fact as of his own knowledge, the falsity of which is not palpable to the purchaser, the purchaser has the undoubted right to rely implicitly upon such statements and the principle has no application (Authorities supra), and in event the purchaser is entrapped thereby and afterwards calls upon the vendor in a court of justice to make compensation for his deceit, the law will not permit him to escape by urging the folly of his dupe nor by admitting that he, the seller, was a knave and a scoundrel, and averring the defrauded party was negligent and careless in thus believing and trusting him, for this would be equivalent to saying, ‘You trusted me, therefore I have a right to betray you.’ <i>Cottrill v. Krum</i>, 100 Mo. 397, 13 S.W. 753.</p>

A very intimate knowledge with the premises will not necessarily imply knowledge of their exact contents, while the particularity of the statement will naturally convey the notion of exact admeasurement. The fact that he had the means of knowing or of obtaining information of the truth which he did not use is not sufficient.…He is not bound to inquire unless something has happened to excite suspicion, or unless there is something in the case or in the terms of the representation to put him on inquiry.…’</p>

Would it not be a shame to jurisprudence if, on the facts found, the conclusions drawn did not irresistibly follow? True, Naxera made no false representations of material facts in person to either Judd or Bourland, but his mouthpiece, Walker, did, and Naxera after notice adopted the transaction and either shared in the polluted gains or aided Walker in pocketing them. True, the written contract preceding the deed was signed by Bourland as a party thereto. But Walker knew at that time that Bourland represented another, and, if he did not know it at that time, both he and Naxera knew it before the deed was made by Naxera to Judd. True, the false representations relating to acreage antedated the written contract and the deed, but the fraud was not merged in those instruments.</p>

<p id="663317b7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Plaintiff’s Misconduct Negating Justifiable Reliance</i>.</b> Assuming that a plaintiff <i>actually relies</i> upon the defendant’s misrepresentation, another possible issue concerns whether that reliance was <i>justifiable</i> under the circumstances. In the <i>Judd</i> case the defendant contended that reliance was not justifiable because the size of the land was open and ascertainable, and the plaintiff should have paid for a formal survey to ascertain the actual acreage. The court stated that the test for justifiable reliance was whether “one exercising ordinary and usual business attention, care and circumspection” would have relied upon the misrepresentation. In applying this somewhat general test of reasonableness, the court elaborated that when the “defect was open and patent to the senses,” that reliance could not be justified and the rule of <i>caveat emptor</i>—or buyer beware—would instead apply. While courts sometimes refer to this justification test as one asking whether the plaintiff’s reliance was “reasonable”—indicating an ordinary negligence standard—in application it appears that most courts are really applying more of a gross negligence standard for the issue of justification. As the court in <i>Judd</i> summarized: “The fact that he had the means of knowing or of obtaining information of the truth which he did not use is not sufficient [to negate justified reliance].…He is not bound to inquire unless something has happened to excite suspicion, or unless there is something in the case or in the terms of representation to put him on inquiry.” Ultimately, the issue of justification turns on whether the fact-finder determines that there were any “red flags” to make the reliance unjustified. What facts would have to have been different for the buyer’s reliance in that case to have been unjustified?</p>
<p id="663317b8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Disclaimer of Reliance Clause in Contracts</i>.</b> Recently, enterprising transaction lawyers have tried to insulate their clients from claims for fraud by use of inventive disclaimer language within the terms of a written contract. Referred to as “disclaimer of reliance” clauses, these are often worded so as to negate any actual reliance by the parties to a contract on any representation made beyond the four corners of the agreement. Under the right circumstances, courts have shown a willingness to enforce such waivers of reliance, particularly among parties of equal bargaining strength and sophistication, and when represented by counsel. Some courts have held, however, that a mere “merger” clause—that recites that no representations or promises outside the terms of the written contract have been made—does not preclude a claim for fraudulent <span title="904" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-904">p. 904</span>inducement. <i>See</i> Italian Cowboy Partners, Ltd. v.

If that were entirely true, of course, there would be no need for courts to recognize separately a fraud claim. If anyone could recover just as easily by proving the lower <i>mens rea</i> for negligent misrepresentation, it would make no sense to attempt to prove greater fault than required to recover. Negligent misrepresentation does have a degree of overlap with a fraud cause of action, but its elements reveal a more limited application in terms of the types of instances where courts will recognize this cause of action.</p>

Defendants never actually lived in the home, but lived close by and visited their daughter regularly. Plaintiff/Appellee, Christell Staggs, viewed the home on three occasions and negotiated a purchase price for the house of $71,000.00. A contract was signed with Defendants to purchase the house for that amount. This contract also provided “that [the] Property has not been damaged or affected by flood or storm run-off and that [the] Property does / does not require flood insurance.” The box next to the phrase “does not” in this sentence was checked. No other explanation was provided by Defendants.</p>
<p id="66333ed8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although Defendants accepted the offer, they never saw the contract and authorized their agent to sign it for them.

<p id="663365e9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff inspected the property herself. She also had the property appraised and inspected by professionals. The appraisal came in at $71,000.00; however, the appraiser noted that the property was in a low-lying area and could be subject to minor flooding. He recommended having a surveyor check for flooding, but issued the appraisal, which was accepted by the bank, without obtaining a survey on the assumption that the property did not flood. A flood certification was obtained that established that the property, like the majority of property in Putnam County, was in flood zone C. Flood insurance could be purchased but was not required.</p>
<p id="663365ea-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the closing, Plaintiff inquired of her agent what ‘flood zone C’ was.

Testimony showed that no residents have had to spend significant time away from the house since the water usually recedes quickly, allowing access to the house within a few hours and completely clearing the property within a day or two.</p>

Kirkpatrick</i>, 823 <span title="907" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-907">p. 907</span>S.W.2d 547, 552 (Tenn. Ct.

App. 1976).</p>
<p id="66338d09-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even though Defendants did not actually read or sign the contract themselves, they are responsible for the actions and representation of their agent, who was authorized to review and sign the contract on their behalf. The court made a finding that, at the time the contract was signed by Defendants’ agent, it represented that the property was not affected by flood or storm runoff. The court also weighed the credibility of the witnesses and, based on testimony at trial, determined that Defendants were well aware of the flooding problems and the extent thereof at the time the contract was signed by their agent. We find the testimony in the record more than sufficient to support these findings.</p>
<p id="66338d0a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Before a seller makes a representation, he is required to exercise reasonable care to make sure that it is correct.” <i>Akbari v. Horn</i>, 641 S.W.2d 506, 508 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1982). The statement regarding flooding and storm runoff was patently false. Defendants’ agent had an obligation to use reasonable care in determining that all representations made in the contract were true and correct. Such care was not used, and Defendants, as the principal, are now responsible for the negligence of their agent.</p>
<p id="66338d0b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants also argue that there was no reasonable reliance on the information supplied in the contract since Plaintiff was free to, and did, perform her own inspection of the building and property. However, as the flooding problem only occurred during periods of very heavy or prolonged rain, it was not readily discoverable by visual inspection. The flood zone was no different than that of the surrounding houses, and the inspection revealed no telltale water damage to the house. Although the appraiser recommended a survey due to the low lying nature of the property, the statement in the contract that there was no flooding or storm runoff diminished the necessity for such survey, and the appraisal was accepted by the bank without question. Plaintiff also testified that she relied on the representation made in the contract that the property was not affected by flooding or storm runoff, and the court accepted her testimony as credible. The facts, as found by the court, support the court’s determination that Plaintiff reasonably relied on the representations made by Defendants, and this evidence certainly does not preponderate against the finding of negligent misrepresentation.</p>
<p id="66338d0c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants/Appellants argued that Tennessee law does not provide for applying comparative fault to negligent misrepresentation cases since, in these cases, Plaintiff must show that she justifiably relied on the misrepresentation, and if Plaintiff was negligent in performing reasonable inspections and inquiries, it cannot be said that she justifiably relied on the representations of Defendant. We find this argument unsound.</p>
<p id="66338d0d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The doctrine of comparative fault in Tennessee is applied to negligence cases, and negligent misrepresentation is an action “in tort determined by the general principles of the law of negligence.” <i>Tartera v. Palumbo</i>, 224 Tenn. 262, 453 S.W.2d 780, 784 (Tenn. 1970). “If the plaintiff meets the burden <span title="908" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-908">p. 908</span>of establishing the defendant’s duty in a particular case, as well as the other elements of the negligence claim, the trier or fact must apply the [49 percent comparative fault principles of <i>McIntyre v. Balentine</i> (See Chapter 7, Defenses)].</p>
<p id="66338d0e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is axiomatic that a plaintiff could commit negligence which might have contributed to the amount of damage suffered, but still have justifiably relied on the defendants’ representations. Justifiable reliance is one of the elements that must be established to the satisfaction of the trial judge by a preponderance of the evidence before the tort of negligent misrepresentation can be established by a plaintiff. Such a finding is not inconsistent with comparative fault on the part of the plaintiff. The trial judge found just such a situation here, and the evidence does not preponderate against that finding. We further find that the judge correctly applied Tennessee’s comparative fault law to these facts and properly reduced the award of damages by the amount of fault attributable to Plaintiff.</p>
<p id="66338d0f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With regard to damages, there was very little evidence introduced other than Plaintiff’s own testimony. She testified, pursuant to Rule 701 of the Tennessee Rules of Evidence, that the value of the property as a result of the flooding was between $32,000.00 and $35,000.00 and asked the court for a judgment of $38,500.00 representing the difference between what she believed she could sell the property for and the $71,000.00 she paid. The judge also viewed the very telling pictures, which showed the house completely surrounded by water only inches away from actually entering the house, and heard the testimony of several real estate agents who articulated their belief that the property would be extremely difficult sell.</p>
<p id="66338d10-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiffs have a right to recover for all losses proximately caused by [defendant’s] tortious conduct. The evidence does not preponderate against the finding of damages in the amount of the $25,000.00.</p>
<p id="66338d11-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Based on the foregoing findings, we affirm the trial court’s Ruling in its entirety.</p>

<p id="66338d14-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Negligent Misrepresentation Elements</i>.</b> While both fraud and negligent misrepresentation require a false representation there are significant other differences, one of which was alluded to by the court above. Fraud requires knowledge of the falsity, or at least recklessness regarding truth. Negligent misrepresentation only requires the defendant to be careless regarding the truthfulness of the information shared. This tort is also narrower in that it is only to be applied in situations where the defendant provides the information in the course of her business or a transaction in which the defendant has a pecuniary interest. Technically one can by liable for fraud for influencing the plaintiff to enter into a transaction with a third party even if the defendant had no interest in the transaction. In this way, this tort can be viewed as somewhat narrow in application. Further, the defendant in a negligent misrepresentation <span title="909" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-909">p. 909</span>case should only be liable toward someone whom the defendant intended to influence in providing the representation. The full meaning of this will be discussed in the next section under Duty Revisited. Finally, many courts hold that a plaintiff in a negligent misrepresentation case may only recover for pecuniary harm, as opposed to lost profits from the transaction. In other words, expenses incurred or sums lost out of pocket might be proper recoveries in a negligent misrepresentation case. In <i>Staggs</i>, what evidence supported the finding in favor of plaintiff on each of these elements?</p>
<p id="66338d15-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Silence as Negligent Misrepresentation?</i></b> Many courts have been reluctant to apply the tort of negligent misrepresentation to instances of silence—in effect, often holding that there is no duty to affirmatively disclose information under this theory. Jurisdictions are fairly mixed on this issue, with some courts holding that silence can never give rise to a negligent misrepresentation claim (<i>see</i> Eberts v. Goderstad, 569 F.3d 757 (7th Cir. 2009) (following the logic that the Restatement only refers to “supply[ing] false information” rather than to silence) and others reaching contrary holdings (<i>See</i> In re Agrobiotech, Inc., 291 F. Supp. 2d 1186 (D. Nev. 2003).</p>
<p id="6633b426-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Justifiable Reliance and Comparative Fault</i>.</b> The court in <i>Staggs</i> found that there was no inconsistency between the finding that plaintiff had justifiably relied on the misrepresentations yet had committed comparative fault in relying upon the misrepresentations. To the extent that a court applies a “reasonable person” standard to the justifiable reliance issue (as was discussed earlier under the Fraud section) do you see any inconsistency here? On the other hand, if courts essentially apply a gross negligence standard (i.e., did the plaintiff ignore obvious red flags?) to the justifiable reliance issue and an ordinary care standard to comparative fault, there would be no such potential inconsistency. This is an area of the law that remains undeveloped. With regard to express disclaimers of reliance, as we saw in fraud cases in the prior section, courts have been willing under the proper circumstances to allow an express provision in the parties’ contract disclaiming reliance on any representations to negate a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation.</p>

<p id="6633b429-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Negligent misrepresentation is a very particular subspecies of a negligence cause of action, applicable in only particular instances and providing relief only for pecuniary losses. As with other negligence causes of action, however, a significant issue in many negligent misrepresentation claims is the fundamental question of duty. Clearly when a professional represents a client there will be no serious question about any duty of care. In fact, when the client is hurt by bad advice or “representations,” courts will often just treat it as a “malpractice” claim. But what about someone who has not hired the professional but <span title="910" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-910">p. 910</span>foreseeably relies upon representations carelessly made by the professional? Does the professional owe a duty of care regarding her representations toward this non-client? Courts around the country have taken, and continue to take, three different views regarding this duty issue. The <i>Bily</i> case below represents the majority view and offers a very comprehensive discussion of the matter. As you read the court’s description of the three competing schools of thought on the issue of duty, which one do you prefer?</p>

The business was founded in 1980 by the entrepreneur Adam Osborne and put on the market the first portable personal computer.</p>
<p id="6633da41-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By fall of 1982, sales of the company’s Osborne I computer were quite good and the firm began planning for initial public offering in 1982. To assist with this IPO, the company hired Arthur Young to prepare audit reports for the recent two years. Arthur Young issued an unqualified opinion on February 11, 1983. However, at the suggestion of underwriters, the offering was postponed.</p>
<p id="6633da42-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the meantime, in order to obtain needed financing, the company issued warrants to investors (individuals and venture capitals) in exchange for direct loans. The warrants entitled their holders to purchase blocks of the company’s stock at favorable prices.</p>
<p id="6633da43-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the warrant transactions closed on April 8, 1983, the company’s performance began to deteriorate. Sales declined sharply, promotion of the new “Executive” computer model turned out to be a disaster. Public offering never materialized. The company had to file for bankruptcy on September 13, 1983. Plaintiffs, who ultimately lost their investments, claimed that in their investments they relied heavily on Arthur Young’s unqualified audit opinion.</p>
<p id="6633da44-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs’ principal expert witness found more than 40 deficiencies in Arthur Young’s performance amounting in his view, to gross professional negligence. It was discovered that Arthur Young was aware of material weaknesses in the company’s controls, yet failed to disclose them as a qualification to its audit report or report to management.]</p>
<p id="6633da45-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case was tried to a jury for 13 weeks. At the close of the evidence and arguments, the jury received instructions and special verdict questions including three theories of recovery: fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and professional negligence. The fraud instructions required proof of an intentional misrepresentation made by defendant “with intent to defraud the plaintiff or a particular class of persons to which plaintiff belonged.” Similarly, the negligent misrepresentation instructions required a negligent misrepresentation made <span title="911" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-911">p. 911</span>“with the intent to induce plaintiff or a particular class of persons to which plaintiff belongs to rely on it.”</p>
<p id="6633da46-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The negligence instructions stated in part that an independent auditor has a duty to have the degree of skill and learning possessed by reputable certified public accountants in the same community and to use “reasonable diligence and its best judgment in the exercise of its professional skill.”</p>
<p id="6633da47-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With respect to liability to third parties, negligence instructions were to the effect that: “An accountant owes a further duty of care to those third parties who reasonably and foreseeably rely on an audited financial statement prepared by the accountant. A failure to fulfill any such duty is negligence.”</p>
<p id="6633da48-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We granted review to consider whether and to what extent an accountant’s duty of care in the preparation of an independent audit of a client’s financial statements extends to persons other than the client.</p>
<p id="6633da49-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since Chief Judge Cardozo’s seminal opinion in <i>Ultramares Corp. v. Touche</i>, 174 N.E. 441 (N.Y. 1931) (<i>Ultramares</i>), the issue before us has been frequently considered and debated by courts and commentators. Different schools of thought have emerged. At the center of the controversy are difficult questions concerning the role of the accounting profession in performing audits, the conceivably limitless scope of an accountant’s liability to nonclients who may come to read and rely on audit reports, and the effect of tort liability rules on the availability, cost, and reliability of those reports.</p>
<p id="6633da4a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We will analyze these questions by discussing the purpose and effect of audits and audit reports, the approaches taken by courts and commentators, and the basic principles of tort liability announced in our prior cases. We conclude that an auditor owes no general duty of care regarding the conduct of an audit to persons other than the client. An auditor may, however, be held liable for negligent misrepresentations in an audit report to those persons who act in reliance upon those misrepresentations in a transaction which the auditor intended to influence, in accordance with the rule of §552 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, as adopted and discussed below. Finally, an auditor may also be held liable to reasonably foreseeable third persons for intentional fraud in the preparation and dissemination of an audit report.</p>

<p id="6633da4c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although certified public accountants (CPA’s) perform a variety of services for their clients, their primary function, which is the one that most frequently generates lawsuits against them by third persons, is financial auditing. “In an audit engagement, an accountant reviews financial statements prepared by a client and issues an opinion stating whether such statements fairly represent the financial status of the audited entity.” Siliciano, <i>supra</i>, 86 Mich. L. Rev. at p. 1931.</p>
<p id="6633da4d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a typical audit, a CPA firm may verify the existence of tangible assets, observe business activities, and confirm account balances and mathematical computations. It might also examine sample transactions or records to ascertain the accuracy of the client company’s financial and accounting systems.</p>
<span title="912" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-912">p. 912</span>
<p id="6633da4e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For practical reasons of time and cost, an audit rarely, if ever, examines every accounting transaction in the records of a business. The planning and execution of an audit therefore require a high degree of professional skill and judgment.</p>
<p id="6634015f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The end product of an audit is the audit report or opinion. The report is generally expressed in a letter addressed to the client. The body of the report refers to the specific client-prepared financial statements which are attached. In the case of the so-called “unqualified report” (of which Arthur Young’s report on the company’s 1982 financial statements is an example), two paragraphs are relatively standard.</p>
<p id="66340160-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a scope paragraph, the CPA firm asserts that it has examined the accompanying financial statements in accordance with GAAS. GAAS are promulgated by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), a national professional organization of CPA’s, whose membership is open to persons holding certified public accountant certificates issued by state boards of accountancy.</p>
<p id="66340161-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In an opinion paragraph, the audit report generally states the CPA firm’s opinion that the audited financial statements, taken as a whole, are in conformity with GAAP and present fairly in all material respects the financial position, results of operations, and changes in financial position of the client in the relevant periods.</p>

<p id="66340163-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The complex nature of the audit function and its economic implications has resulted in different approaches to the question whether CPA auditors should be subjected to liability to third parties who read and rely on audit reports. Although three schools of thought are commonly recognized, there are some variations within each school and recent case law suggests a possible trend toward merger of two of the three approaches.</p>
<p id="66340164-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A substantial number of jurisdictions follow the lead of Chief Judge Cardozo’s 1931 opinion for the New York Court of Appeals in <i>Ultramares, supra</i>, 174 N.E. 441, by denying recovery to third parties for auditor negligence in the absence of a third party relationship to the auditor that is “akin to privity.” In contrast, a handful of jurisdictions, spurred by law review commentary, have recently allowed recovery based on auditor negligence to third parties whose reliance on the audit report was “foreseeable.”</p>
<p id="66340165-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most jurisdictions, supported by the weight of commentary and the modern English common law decisions cited by the parties, have steered a middle course based in varying degrees on Restatement Second of Torts §552, which generally imposes liability on suppliers of commercial information to third persons who are intended beneficiaries of the information. Finally, the federal securities laws have also dealt with the problem by imposing auditor liability for <span title="913" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-913">p. 913</span>negligence-related conduct only in connection with misstatements in publicly filed and distributed offering documents.</p>

<p id="66340167-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Ultramares</i>, plaintiff made three unsecured loans totalling $165,000 to a company that went bankrupt. Plaintiff sued the company’s auditors, claiming reliance on their audit opinion that the company’s balance sheet “present[ed] a true and correct view of the financial condition of [the company].” Although the balance sheet showed a net worth of $1 million, the company was actually insolvent. The company’s management attempted to mask its financial condition; the auditors failed to follow paper trails to “off-the-books” transactions that, if properly analyzed, would have revealed the company’s impecunious situation.</p>
<p id="66340168-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The jury, precluded by the trial judge from considering a fraud cause of action, returned a verdict in plaintiff’s favor based on the auditor’s negligence in conducting the audit. The New York Court of Appeals, speaking through Chief Judge Cardozo, reinstated the fraud cause of action but set aside the negligence verdict.</p>
<p id="66340169-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With respect to the negligence claim, the court found the auditor owed no duty to the third party creditor for an “erroneous opinion.” In an often quoted passage, it observed: “If liability for negligence exists, a thoughtless slip or blunder, the failure to detect a theft or forgery beneath the cover of deceptive entries, may expose accountants to a liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class. The hazards of a business conducted on these terms are so extreme as to enkindle doubt whether a flaw may not exist in the implication of a duty that exposes to these consequences.”</p>
<p id="6634016a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although acknowledging the demise of privity of contract as a limitation on tort liability in the context of personal injury and property damage, the court distinguished between liability arising from a “physical force” and “the circulation of a thought or the release of the explosive power resident in words.”</p>
<p id="6634016b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In summarizing its holding, the court emphasized that it was not releasing auditors from liability to third parties for fraud but merely for “honest blunder.” It questioned “whether the average business man receiving a certificate without paying for it, and receiving it as one of a multitude of possible investors, would look for anything more.”</p>
<p id="6634016c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From the cases cited by the parties, it appears at least nine states purport to follow privity or near privity rules restricting the liability of auditors to parties with whom they have a contractual or similar relationship. In five states, this result has been reached by decisions of their highest courts. In four other states, the rule has been enacted by statute. Federal court decisions have held that the rule represents the law of three additional states whose highest courts have not expressly considered the question.</p>

In its place, he proposed a rule based on foreseeability of injury to third persons. Criticizing what he called the “anachronistic protection” given to accountants by the traditional rules limiting third person liability, he concluded: “Accountant liability based on foreseeable injury would serve the dual functions of compensation for injury and deterrence of negligent conduct. Moreover, it is a just and rational judicial policy that the same criteria govern the imposition of negligence liability, regardless of the context in which it arises. The accountant, the investor, and the general public will in the long run benefit when the liability of the certified public accountant for negligent misrepresentation is measured by the foreseeability standard.” Under the rule proposed by Justice Wiener, “[f]oreseeability of the risk would be a question of fact for the jury to be disturbed on appeal only where there is insufficient evidence to support the finding.”</p>
<p id="6634287f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The supreme courts in New Jersey, Wisconsin, Mississippi, and an intermediate court of appeals in California have since adopted the foreseeability approach first advocated by Justice Wiener. Nevertheless, in] the nearly 10 years since it was formally proposed, the foreseeability approach has not attracted a substantial following. And at least four state supreme courts have explicitly rejected the foreseeability approach in favor of the Restatement’s “intended beneficiary” approach since the New Jersey court’s decision in <i>Rosenblum</i>.</p>
<p id="66342880-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The foreseeability approach has also encountered substantial criticism from commentators, who have questioned, among other matters, its failure to consider seriously the problem of indeterminate liability and its prediction of a significant deterrent effect that will improve the quality of audit reporting. Other commentators have disagreed. The body of scholarly and practical literature is substantial.</p>

<p id="66342882-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Restatement (Second) of Torts §552 covers “Information Negligently Supplied for the Guidance of Others.” It states a general principle that one who negligently supplies false information “for the guidance of others in their business transactions” is liable for economic loss suffered by the recipients in justifiable reliance on the information. But the liability created by the general principle is expressly limited to loss suffered: “(a) [B]y the person or one of a limited group of persons for whose benefit and guidance he intends to supply the information or knows that the recipient intends to supply it; and (b) through reliance upon it in a transaction that he intends the information to influence or knows that the recipient so intends or in a substantially similar transaction.” To paraphrase, a <span title="915" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-915">p. 915</span>supplier of information is liable for negligence to a third party only if he or she intends to supply the information for the benefit of one or more third parties in a specific transaction or type of transaction identified to the supplier.</p>
<p id="66342883-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Comment (h) observes that the liability of a negligent supplier of information is appropriately more narrowly restricted than that of an intentionally fraudulent supplier. It also notes that a commercial supplier of information has a legitimate concern as to the nature and scope of the client’s transactions that may expand the supplier’s exposure liability. As the comment states: “In many situations the identity of the person for whose guidance the information is supplied is of no moment to the person who supplies it, although the number and character of the persons to be reached and influenced, and the nature and extent of the transaction for which guidance is furnished may be vitally important. <i>This is true because the risk of liability to which the supplier subjects himself by undertaking to give the information, while it may not be affected by the identity of the person for whose guidance the information is given, is vitally affected by the number and character of the persons, and particularly the nature and the extent of the proposed transaction</i>.” (Italics added.)</p>
<p id="66342884-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To offer a simple illustration of comment (h), an auditor engaged to perform an audit and render a report to a third person whom the auditor knows is considering a $10 million investment in the client’s business is on notice of a specific potential liability. It may then act to encounter, limit or avoid the risk. In contrast, an auditor who is simply asked for a generic audit and report to the client has no comparable notice.</p>
<p id="66342885-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the parties debate precisely how many states follow the Restatement rule, a review of the cases reveals the rule has somewhat more support than the privity of relationship rule and much more support than the foreseeability rule. At least 17 state and federal decisions have endorsed the rule in this and related contexts. Whatever the exact number of states that have endorsed it, the Restatement rule has been for many, if not most, courts a satisfactory compromise between their discomfort with the traditional privity approach and the “specter of unlimited liability.”</p>
<p id="66342886-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In attempting to ascertain the presence of an intent to benefit third parties from the facts of particular audit engagements and communications with auditors, the Restatement rule inevitably results in some degree of uncertainty. Dean William L. Prosser, the Reporter for the Restatement, reflected on the difficulty of formulating a comprehensive rule in this area:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="66342887-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">The problem is to find language which will eliminate liability to the very large class of persons whom almost any negligently given information may foreseeably reach and influence, and limit the liability, not to a particular plaintiff defined in advance, but to the comparatively small group whom the defendant expects and intends to influence. Neither the Reporter, nor, it is believed, the Advisers nor the Council, is entirely satisfied with the language of Subsection (2); and if anyone can do better, it will be most welcome.</p></div>

<p id="66344f9a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The threshold element of a cause of action for negligence is the existence of a duty to use due care toward an interest of another that enjoys legal protection against unintentional invasion. Whether this essential prerequisite to a negligence cause of action has been satisfied in a particular case is a question of law to be resolved by the court.</p>
<p id="66344f9b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A judicial conclusion that a duty is present or absent is merely “a shorthand statement…rather than an aid to analysis.…[D]uty, is not sacrosanct in itself, but only an expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the particular plaintiff is entitled to protection.” <i>Dillon v. Legg</i>, 441 P.2d 912 (Cal. 1968).</p>
<p id="663476ac-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have employed a checklist of factors to consider in assessing legal duty in the absence of privity of contract between a plaintiff and a defendant:</p>

<p id="663476ad-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">The determination whether in a specific case the defendant will be held liable to a third person not in privity is a matter of policy and involves the balancing of various factors, among which are the extent to which the transaction was intended to affect the plaintiff, the foreseeability of harm to him, the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury, the closeness of the connection between the defendant’s conduct and the injury suffered, the moral blame attached to the defendant’s conduct, and the policy of preventing future harm.</p></div>
<p id="663476ae-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Biakanja v. Irving</i>, 320 P.2d 16 (Cal. 1958).</p>
<p id="663476af-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Viewing the problem before us in light of the factors set forth above, we decline to permit all merely foreseeable third party users of audit reports to sue the auditor on a theory of professional negligence. Our holding is premised on three central concerns: (1) Given the secondary “watchdog” role of the auditor, the complexity of the professional opinions rendered in audit reports, and the difficult and potentially tenuous causal relationships between audit reports and economic losses from investment and credit decisions, the auditor exposed to negligence claims from all foreseeable third parties faces potential liability far out of proportion to its fault; (2) the generally more sophisticated class of plaintiffs in auditor liability cases (e.g., business lenders and investors) permits the effective use of contract rather than tort liability to control and adjust the relevant risks through “private ordering”; and (3) the asserted advantages of more accurate auditing and more efficient loss spreading relied upon by those who advocate a pure foreseeability approach are unlikely to occur; indeed, dislocations of resources, including increased expense and decreased availability of auditing services in some sectors of the economy, are more probable consequences of expanded liability.</p>
<p id="663476b0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a broad sense, economic injury to lenders, investors, and others who may read and rely on audit reports is certainly “foreseeable.” Foreseeability of injury, however, is but one factor to be considered in the imposition of negligence liability. Even when foreseeability was present, we have on several recent <span title="917" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-917">p. 917</span>occasions declined to allow recovery on a negligence theory when damage awards threatened to impose liability out of proportion to fault or to promote virtually unlimited responsibility for intangible injury.</p>
<p id="663476b1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In placing explicit limits on recovery for negligent infliction of emotional distress by accident bystanders, we commented: “‘[F]oreseeability’ ‘is endless because [it], like light, travels indefinitely in a vacuum.’ [It] proves too much.…Although it may set tolerable limits for most types of physical harm, it provides virtually no limit on liability for non-physical harm.’…It is apparent that reliance on foreseeability of injury alone in finding a duty, and thus a right to recover, is not adequate when the damages sought are for an intangible injury. In order to avoid limitless liability out of all proportion to the degree of a defendant’s negligence, and against which it is impossible to insure without imposing unacceptable costs on those among whom the risk is spread, the right to recover for negligently caused emotional distress must be limited.” <i>Thing v. La Chusa</i>, 71 P.2d 814 (Cal. 1989).</p>
<p id="663476b2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Emphasizing the important role of policy factors in determining negligence, we observed that “there are clear judicial days on which a court can foresee forever and thus determine liability but none on which that foresight alone provides a socially and judicially acceptable limit on recovery of damages for [an] injury.” <i>Id</i>. In line with our recent decisions, we will not treat the mere presence of a foreseeable risk of injury to third persons as sufficient, standing alone, to impose liability for negligent conduct.</p>
<p id="6634c4d3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In view of the factors discussed above, judicial endorsement of third party negligence suits against auditors limited only by the concept of foreseeability raises the spectre of multibillion-dollar professional liability that is distinctly out of proportion to: (1) the fault of the auditor (which is necessarily secondary and may be based on complex differences of professional opinion); and (2) the connection between the auditor’s conduct and the third party’s injury (which will often be attenuated by unrelated business factors that underlie investment and credit decisions).</p>
<p id="6634c4d4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a matter of economic and social policy, third parties should be encouraged to rely on their own prudence, diligence, and contracting power, as well as other informational tools. This kind of self-reliance promotes sound investment and credit practices and discourages the careless use of monetary resources. If, instead, third parties are simply permitted to recover from the auditor for mistakes in the client’s financial statements, the auditor becomes, in effect, an insurer of not only the financial statements, but of bad loans and investments in general.</p>
<p id="6634c4d5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the reasons stated above, we hold that an auditor’s liability for general negligence in the conduct of an audit of its client financial statements is confined to the client, i.e., the person who contracts for or engages the audit services. Other persons may not recover on a pure negligence theory.</p>
<p id="6634c4d6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One difficulty in considering the problem before us is that neither the courts (ourselves included), the commentators, nor the authors of the Restatement Second of Torts have made clear or careful distinctions between the tort of <span title="918" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-918">p. 918</span>negligence and the separate tort of negligent misrepresentation. The distinction is important not only because of the different statutory bases of the two torts, but also because it has practical implications for the trial of cases in complex areas such as the one before us.</p>
<p id="6634c4d7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Negligent misrepresentation is a separate and distinct tort, a species of the tort of deceit. “Where the defendant makes false statements, honestly believing that they are true, but without reasonable ground for such belief, he may be liable for negligent misrepresentation, a form of deceit.” 5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1988) Torts, §720 at p. 819.</p>
<p id="6634c4d8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under certain circumstances, expressions of professional opinion are treated as representations of fact. When a statement, although in the form of an opinion, is “not a casual expression of belief” but “a deliberate affirmation of the matters stated,” it may be regarded as a positive assertion of fact. Moreover, when a party possesses or holds itself out as possessing superior knowledge or special information or expertise regarding the subject matter and a plaintiff is so situated that it may reasonably rely on such supposed knowledge, information, or expertise, the defendant’s representation may be treated as one of material fact. There is no dispute that Arthur Young’s statements in audit opinions fall within these principles.</p>
<p id="6634c4d9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the person or “class of persons entitled to rely upon the representations is restricted to those to whom or for whom the misrepresentations were made. Even though the defendant should have anticipated that the misinformation might reach others, he is not liable to them.” 5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, <i>supra</i>, Torts, §721 at p. 820.</p>
<p id="6634c4da-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of the approaches we have reviewed, §552 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts subdivision (b) is most consistent with the elements and policy foundations of the tort of negligent misrepresentation. The rule expressed there attempts to define a narrow and circumscribed class of persons to whom or for whom representations are made. In this way, it recognizes commercial realities by avoiding both unlimited and uncertain liability for economic losses in cases of professional mistake and exoneration of the auditor in situations where it clearly intended to undertake the responsibility of influencing particular business transactions involving third persons. The Restatement rule thus appears to be a sensible and moderate approach to the potential consequences of imposing unlimited negligence liability which we have identified.</p>
<p id="6634c4db-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We recognize the rule expressed in the Restatement Second of Torts has been criticized in some quarters as vague and potentially arbitrary. In his article advocating a foreseeability rule, Justice Wiener generally criticized the Restatement rule as resting “solely on chance considerations” and “fortuitousness” (e.g., the “state of the mind of the accountant” and the scope of his engagement) having, in his view, nothing to do with increasing the flow of accurate information.</p>
<p id="6634c4dc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We respectfully disagree. In seeking to identify a specific class of persons and a transaction that the supplier of information “intends the information to influence,” the authors of the Restatement Second of Torts have applied basic <span title="919" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-919">p. 919</span>factors of tort liability recognized in this state and elsewhere. By confining what might otherwise be unlimited liability to those persons whom the engagement is designed to benefit, the Restatement rule requires that the supplier of information receive notice of potential third party claims, thereby allowing it to ascertain the potential scope of its liability and make rational decisions regarding the undertaking. The receipt of such notice justifies imposition of auditor liability for conduct that is merely negligent.</p>
<p id="6634c4dd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Restatement Second of Torts approach is also the only one that achieves consistency in the law of negligent misrepresentation. Accountants are not unique in their position as suppliers of information and evaluations for the use and benefit of others. Other professionals, including attorneys, architects, engineers, title insurers and abstractors, and others also perform that function. And, like auditors, these professionals may also face suits by third persons claiming reliance on information and opinions generated in a professional capacity.</p>
<p id="6634c4de-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By allowing recovery for negligent misrepresentation (as opposed to mere negligence), we emphasize the indispensability of justifiable reliance on the statements contained in the report. As the jury instructions in this case illustrate, a general negligence charge directs attention to defendant’s level of care and compliance with professional standards established by expert testimony, as opposed to plaintiff’s reliance on a materially false statement made by defendant. The reliance element in such an instruction is only implicit–it must be argued and considered by the jury as part of its evaluation of the causal relationship between defendant’s conduct and plaintiff’s injury. In contrast, an instruction based on the elements of negligent misrepresentation necessarily and properly focuses the jury’s attention on the truth or falsity of the audit report’s representations and plaintiff’s actual and justifiable reliance on them. Because the audit report, not the audit itself, is the foundation of the third person’s claim, negligent misrepresentation more precisely captures the gravamen of the cause of action and more clearly conveys the elements essential to a recovery.</p>
<p id="6634c4df-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Based on our decision, the California standard jury instructions concerning negligent misrepresentation should be amended in future auditor liability cases to permit the jury to determine whether plaintiff belongs to the class of persons to whom or for whom the representations in the audit report were made.</p>

<p id="6634ebf1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case was tried on the assumption that the general negligence rule and foreseeability approach represented California law. The jury was instructed in accordance with that approach. For the reasons stated above, we have rejected [those rules] in favor of a negligent misrepresentation rule substantially in accord with §552 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts. As a result, plaintiffs’ judgment based on the general negligence rule must be set aside. Because plaintiffs were not clients of Arthur Young, they were not entitled to recover on a general negligence theory.</p>
<span title="920" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-920">p. 920</span>
<p id="6634ebf2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The jury also rejected plaintiffs’ causes of action for negligent misrepresentation and intentional fraud. Although it was not instructed in accordance with the rules we have announced here, the jury was told Arthur Young could be held liable for misrepresentation to “plaintiff or a particular class of persons to which plaintiff belonged.” If anything, these general instructions are more favorable to plaintiffs than the ones required by our decision, which more narrowly and specifically defines the “class of persons” entitled to recover.</p>

Nevertheless, the multi-billion dollar recovery in <i>Pennzoil v. Texaco</i> did much to bring this somewhat obscure cause of action to the forefront of the business and legal communities. Regardless of the age of this legal theory and its recent ascendance in attempted application, there has been significant confusion <span title="922" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-922">p. 922</span>regarding two different branches of this area of law—(a) intentional interference with existing contracts, versus (b) intentional interference with merely prospective contractual relations.

At impact, a white haze enveloped the ships until carried away by prevailing winds, and containers aboard Testbank were damaged and lost overboard. The white haze proved to be hydrobromic acid and the contents of the containers which went overboard proved to be approximately twelve tons of pentachlorophenol, PCP, assertedly the largest such spill in United States history. The United States Coast Guard closed the outlet to navigation until August 10, 1980 and all fishing, shrimping, and related activity was temporarily suspended in the outlet and four hundred square miles of surrounding marsh and waterways.</p>

These suits presented claims of shipping interests, marina and boat rental operators, wholesale and retail seafood enterprises not actually engaged in fishing, seafood restaurants, tackle and bait shops, and recreational fishermen. They proffered an assortment of liability theories, including maritime tort, private actions pursuant to various sections of the Rivers &amp; Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899 and rights of action under Louisiana law. Jurisdiction rested on the proposition that the collision and contamination were maritime torts and within the court’s maritime jurisdiction. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. §1333.</p>

The panel, as did the district court, pointed to the doctrine of <i>Robins Dry Dock &amp; Repair Co. v. Flint</i>, 275 U.S. 303 (1927), and its development in this circuit. Judge Wisdom specially concurred, agreeing that the denial of these claims was required by precedent, but urging reexamination en banc. We then took the case en banc for that purpose. After extensive additional briefs and oral argument, we are unpersuaded that we ought to drop physical damage to a proprietary interest as a prerequisite to recovery for economic loss. To the contrary, our reexamination of the history and central purpose of this pragmatic restriction on the doctrine of foreseeability heightens our commitment to it. Ultimately we conclude that without this limitation foreseeability loses much of its ability to function as a rule of law.</p>

<p id="6635614d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Robins</i> broke no new ground but instead applied a principle, then settled both in the United States and England, which refused recovery for negligent interference with “contractual rights.” Stated more broadly, the prevailing rule denied a plaintiff recovery for economic loss if that loss resulted from physical damage to property in which he had no proprietary interest. <i>See, e.g., Byrd v. English</i>, 43 S.E. 419 (Ga. 1903); <i>Cattle v. Stockton Waterworks Co.</i>, 10 Q.B. 453, 457 (C.A. 1875). <i>See also</i> James, <i>Limitations on Liability for Economic Loss Caused by Negligence: A Pragmatic Appraisal</i>, 25 Vand. L.

L. Rev. 728 (1928). Professor James explains this limitation on recovery of pure economic loss: “The explanation…is a pragmatic one: the physical consequences of negligence usually have been limited, but the indirect economic repercussions of negligence may be far wider, indeed virtually open-ended.” James, <i>supra</i>, at 45.</p>

The defendant negligently caused its pipes to leak, thereby increasing the plaintiff’s cost in performing its contract to dig a tunnel. The British court, writing fifty-two years before <i>Robins</i>, denied the plaintiff’s claim. The court explained that if recovery were not contained, then in cases such as <i>Rylands v. Fletcher</i>, 1 L.R.—E.X. 265 (1866), the defendant would be liable not only to the owner of the mine and its workers “but also to…every workman and person employed in the mine, who in consequence of its stoppage made less wages than he would otherwise have done.”</p>

<p id="66358866-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff in <i>Elliott Steam Tug</i> was a charterer of a tug boat who lost profits when the vessel was requisitioned by the admiralty under wartime legislative powers. In applying an indemnity statute that authorized recovery, the court noted that the charterer could not have recovered at common law: “the charterer in collision cases does not recover profits, <i>not because the loss of profits during repairs is not the direct consequence of the wrong</i>, but because the common law rightly or wrongly does not recognize him as able to sue for such an injury to his mere contractual rights.” <i>Id.</i> at 140.

In <i>The Federal No. 2</i>, the third case cited by Justice Holmes, the defendant tug negligently injured plaintiff’s employee while he was working on a barge.

<p id="66358869-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The principle that there could be no recovery for economic loss absent physical injury to a proprietary interest was not only well established when <i>Robins Dry Dock</i> was decided, but was remarkably resilient as well. Its strength is demonstrated by the circumstance that <i>Robins Dry Dock</i> came ten years after Judge Cardozo’s shattering of privity in <i>MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.</i>, 111 N.E. 1050 (N.Y. 1916). Indeed this limit on liability stood against a sea of change in the tort law. Retention of this conspicuous bright-line rule in the face of the reforms brought by the increased influence of the school of legal realism is strong testament both to the rule’s utility and to the absence of a more “conceptually pure” substitute. The push to delete the restrictions on recovery for economic loss lost its support and by the early 1940’s had failed. <i>See</i> W. Prosser, <i>Law of Torts</i> §129, at 938-940 (4th ed. 1971). In sum, it is an old sword that plaintiffs have here picked up.</p>
<p id="6635af7a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs would confine <i>Robins</i> to losses suffered for inability to perform contracts between a plaintiff and others, categorizing the tort as a species of interference with contract. When seen in the historical context described above, however, it is apparent that <i>Robins Dry Dock</i> represents more than a limit on recovery for interference with contractual rights. Apart from what it represented and certainly apart from what it became, its literal holding was not so restricted. If a time charterer’s relationship to its negligently injured vessel is too remote, other claimants without even the connection of a contract are even more remote.</p>
<p id="6635af7b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a sense, every claim of economic injury rests in some measure on an interference with contract or prospective advantage. It was only in this sense that profits were lost in <i>Byrd v. English</i> when the electrical power to plaintiffs printing plant was cut off. The printing company’s contractual right to receive power was interfered with, and in turn, its ability to print for its customers was impinged. That the printing company had a contract with the power company did not make more remote the relationship between its loss of profits and the tortious acts. To the contrary, the contract reduced this remoteness by defining an orbit of predictable injury smaller than if there were no contract between the power company and the printer. When the loss is economic rather than <span title="926" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-926">p. 926</span>physical, that the loss caused a breach of contract or denied an expectancy is of no moment. If a plaintiff connected to the damaged chattels by contract cannot recover, others more remotely situated are foreclosed <i>a fortiori</i>. Indisputably, the <i>Robins Dry Dock</i> principle is not as easily contained as plaintiff would have it. We turn to our application of the principle, its application in other circuits, and the tort law of our Gulf states before returning to the doctrine itself.</p>
<p id="6635af7c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This circuit has consistently refused to allow recovery for economic loss absent physical damage to a proprietary interest. In <i>Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp. v. Marshland Dredging Co., Inc.</i>, 455 F.2d 957 (5th Cir. 1972), the plaintiff lost gas supplies when the defendant negligently broke a gas pipeline. We held that because the interference with Kaiser’s business was only negligently inflicted, recovery was precluded as a matter of law. In <i>Dick Meyers Towing Service, Inc. v. United States</i>, 577 F.2d 1023 (5th Cir. 1978), we denied recovery to a tug boat operator for damages suffered when a lock on Alabama’s Warrior River was closed as a result of defendant’s negligence.

<p id="6635af7f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Union Oil</i>, vast quantities of raw crude were released when the defendant oil company negligently caused an oil spill. The oil was carried by wind, wave, and tidal currents over large stretches of the California coast disrupting, among other things, commercial fishing operations. While conceding that ordinarily there is no recovery for economic losses unaccompanied by physical damage, the court concluded that commercial fishermen were foreseeable plaintiffs whose interests the oil company had a duty to protect when conducting drilling operations. The opinion pointed out that the fishermen’s losses were foreseeable and direct consequences of the spill, that fishermen have historically enjoyed a protected position under maritime law, and suggested that economic considerations also supported permitting recovery.</p>
<p id="6635af80-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet <i>Union Oil’s</i> holding was carefully limited to commercial fishermen, plaintiffs whose economic losses were characterized as “of a particular and special nature.” 501 F.2d at 570. The <i>Union Oil</i> panel expressly declined to “open the door to claims that may be asserted by…other[s]…whose economic or personal affairs were discommoded by the oil spill” and noted that the general rule denying recovery for pure economic loss had “a legitimate sphere within which to operate.”</p>
<p id="6635af81-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A substantial argument can be made that commercial fishermen possess a proprietary interest in fish in waters they normally harvest sufficient to allow recovery for their loss. Whether the claims of commercial fishermen ought to be analyzed in this manner or simply carved from the rule today announced, in the fashion of <i>Union Oil</i>, or allowed at all, we leave for later. That is, today’s decision <span title="927" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-927">p. 927</span>does not foreclose free consideration by a court panel of the claims of commercial fishermen.</p>
<p id="6635af82-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, the decisions of courts in other circuits convince us that <i>Robins Dry Dock</i> is both a widely used and necessary limitation on recovery for economic losses. The holdings in <i>Kinsman</i> and <i>Union Oil</i> are not to the contrary. The courts in both those cases made plain that restrictions on the concept of foreseeability ought to be imposed where recovery is sought for pure economic losses.</p>
<p id="6635af83-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Jurisprudence developed in the Gulf states informs our maritime decisions. It supports the <i>Robins</i> rule.

<p id="6635d695-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs urge that the requirement of physical injury to a proprietary interest is arbitrary, unfair, and illogical, as it denies recovery for foreseeable injury caused by negligent acts. At its bottom the argument is that questions of remoteness ought to be left to the trier of fact. Ultimately the question becomes who ought to decide—judge or jury—and whether there will be a rule beyond the jacket of a given case. The plaintiffs contend that the “problem” need not be separately addressed, but instead should be handled by “traditional” principles of tort law. Putting the problem of which doctrine is the traditional one aside, their rhetorical questions are flawed in several respects.</p>
<p id="6635d696-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those who would delete the requirement of physical damage have no rule or principle to substitute. Their approach fails to recognize limits upon the adjudicating ability of courts. We do not mean just the ability to supply a judgment; prerequisite to this adjudicatory function are preexisting rules, whether the creature of courts or legislatures. Courts can decide cases without preexisting normative guidance but the result becomes less judicial and more the product of a managerial, legislative or negotiated function.</p>
<p id="6635d697-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Review of the foreseeable consequences of the collision of the Sea Daniel and Testbank demonstrates the wave upon wave of successive economic consequences and the managerial role plaintiffs would have us assume. The vessel delayed in St. Louis may be unable to fulfill its obligation to haul from Memphis, to the injury of the shipper, to the injury of the buyers, to the injury of their customers. Plaintiffs concede, as do all who attack the requirement of physical damage, that a line would need to be drawn—somewhere on the other side, each plaintiff would say in turn, of its recovery. Plaintiffs advocate not only that the lines be drawn elsewhere but also that they be drawn on an ad hoc and discrete basis. The result would be that no determinable measure of the limit of foreseeability would precede the decision on liability. We are told that when the claim is too remote, or too tenuous, recovery will be denied. Presumably then, as <span title="928" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-928">p. 928</span>among all plaintiffs suffering foreseeable economic loss, recovery will turn on a judge or jury’s decision. There will be no rationale for the differing results save the “judgment” of the trier of fact. Concededly, it can “decide” all the claims presented, and with comparative if not absolute ease. The point is not that such a process cannot be administered but rather that its judgments would be much less the products of a determinable rule of law. In this important sense, the resulting decisions would be judicial products only in their draw upon judicial resources.</p>
<p id="6635d698-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The bright line rule of damage to a proprietary interest, as most, has the virtue of predictability with the vice of creating results in cases at its edge that are said to be “unjust” or “unfair.” Plaintiffs point to seemingly perverse results, where claims the rule allows and those it disallows are juxtaposed—such as vessels striking a dock, causing minor but recoverable damage, then lurching athwart a channel causing great but unrecoverable economic loss. The answer is that when lines are drawn sufficiently sharp in their definitional edges to be reasonable and predictable, such differing results are the inevitable result—indeed, decisions are the desired product. But there is more. The line drawing sought by plaintiffs is no less arbitrary because the line drawing appears only in the outcome—as one claimant is found too remote and another is allowed to recover. The true difference is that plaintiffs’ approach would mask the results. The present rule would be more candid, and in addition, by making results more predictable, serves a normative function. It operates as a rule of law and allows a court to adjudicate rather than manage.</p>

<p id="6635d69f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Robins</i> was a tort case grounded on a contract. Whatever the justification for the original holding, this Court’s requirement of physical injury as a condition to recovery is an unwarranted step backwards in torts jurisprudence. The resulting bar for claims of economic loss unaccompanied by any physical damage conflicts with conventional tort principles of foreseeability and proximate cause. I would analyze the plaintiffs’ claims under these principles, using the “particular damage” requirement of public nuisance law as an additional means of limiting claims. Although this approach requires a case-by-case analysis, it comports with the fundamental idea of fairness that innocent plaintiffs should receive compensation and negligent defendants should bear the cost of their tortious acts. Such a result is worth the additional costs of adjudicating these claims, and this rule of liability appears to be more economically efficient. Finally, this result would relieve courts of the necessity of manufacturing exceptions totally inconsistent with the expanded <i>Robins</i> rule of requiring physical injury as a prerequisite to recovery.</p>

<p id="6635fdb2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On July 22, 1980, at 8:44 p.m., the inbound bulk carrier M/V Sea Daniel collided with the outbound container ship M/V Testbank at Mile 41 of the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet Channel. This channel is a 66-mile, man-made shortcut between New Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico. Immediately following the collision, a cloud of hydrobromic acid mist enveloped the ships from ruptured containers onboard the Testbank. The prevailing winds carried the acid cloud to Shell Beach, Louisiana, a little town downwind of the collision. The collision damaged several containers on the Testbank, which were then lost overboard. One of these containers held about twelve tons of pentachlorophenol (PCP) in fifty-pound bags. This was the largest PCP spill in the United States history. [The PCP involved here is distinct from “angel dust,” which is also often designated by the initials PCP.]</p>
<p id="6635fdb3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The same day, Civil Defense and local authorities evacuated all residents within a ten-mile radius of the collision. The Coast Guard closed the Outlet to vessel navigation. Health officials suspended all fishing, shrimping, and associated activities on the Outlet and within about 400 square miles of surrounding Louisiana waterways and marshes. They also embargoed seafood and shellfish caught in the area and widely broadcast notice of this embargo. The closure and suspensions lasted through mid-August.</p>
<p id="6635fdb4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The commercial fishing industry in the area sustained serious losses, primarily from the depressed market in that industry in southern Louisiana.

<p id="663624cf-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is a long step from <i>Robins</i> to a rule that requires <i>physical damage</i> as a prerequisite to recovery in maritime tort. The majority believes that the plaintiff’s lack of any contractual connection with an injured party, taken with the <i>Robins</i> rule, forecloses liability: “If a plaintiff connected to the damaged chattels by contract cannot recover, others more remotely situated are foreclosed <i>a fortiori</i>.” This conclusion follows readily from the reasoning that if uninjured contracting parties are barred from recovery, and if contracting parties have a closer legal relationship than non-contracting parties, then a party who is not physically injured and who does not have a contractual relation to the damage is surely barred.</p>
<p id="663624d0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This argument would be sound in instances where the plaintiff suffered no loss <i>but for a contract</i> with the injured party. We would measure a plaintiff’s connection to the tortfeasor by the only line connecting them, the contract, and disallow the claim under <i>Robins</i>. In the instant case, however, some of the plaintiffs suffered damages whether or not they had a contractual connection with a party physically injured by the tortfeasor. These plaintiffs do not need to rely on a contract to link them to the tort: The collision proximately caused their losses, and those losses were foreseeable. These plaintiffs are therefore freed from the <i>Robins</i> rule concerning the recovery of those who suffered economic loss because of an injury to a party with whom they have contracted.</p>
<p id="663624d1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">CONCLUSION</p>

<p id="663624d5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Overlap Between the Mere Economic Harm Rule and Failure to Recognize Negligent Interference with Contract</i>.</b> This case can be understood in light of two parallel, but not identical, doctrines. One is the fairly stubborn refusal by courts to recognize a cause of action for negligent interference by a third party with another’s contractual performance, even where it is foreseeable that such unintended interference might cause losses to another in privity of contract. The other is the fairly rigid adherence to the “mere economic loss” rule that we encountered in Chapter 6, Special Duty Rules. Part of the Fifth Circuit’s discussion in the foregoing case concerns its view on whether the <i>Robins</i> decision was just an application of the rule rejecting negligent interference with contract as a recognized cause of action or, rather, whether it involved application of the broader mere economic loss rule. Do you see how either rule would have hurt the plaintiff’s claims in <i>Robins</i>, but how application of the latter rule was necessary to dismiss most of the plaintiffs’ claims here?</p>
<p id="663624d6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Modern Adherence to Mere Economic Harm Rule</i>.</b> Do you prefer the bright-line approach reaffirmed by the Fifth Circuit or the dissent’s approach of just employing traditional tort stalwarts of foreseeability and proximate cause to determine, on a case-by-case approach, how far liability should extend? Is one approach better or worse for commerce?</p>
<p id="663624d7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Strict Products Liability Application</i>.</b> Another common manifestation of the economic loss rule is in the area of strict products liability. Courts uniformly hold that where the defect in a product only causes injury to the product itself—rather than also causing personal injuries or harm to other property—the only cause of action lies in contract law (i.e. warranty) rather than tort law. As one court surmised, after surveying holdings from many jurisdictions, “the United States Supreme Court, the overwhelming majority of state courts, and legal scholars have recognized the unfairness of imposing on a seller [of defective goods] tort liability for economic loss.” Alloway v. General Marine Industries, L.P., 695 A.2d 264, 271 (N.J. 1997) (plaintiff’s attempt to recover for lost value/repairs to defective boat on tort theories held invalid). The thought seems to be that tort theories were made more for unreasonable risks of harm to persons and other property than for unmet expectations regarding the subject of the transaction. The draft of the Third Restatement of Torts also concurs in this line of reasoning.</p>
<p id="663624d8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Policy Justifications?</i></b> We will next be turning to a discussion of the cause of action entitled tortious interference with contract, which is an <span title="932" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-932">p. 932</span>intentional tort.

<p id="66364beb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">A relatively old business tort exists for “tortious interference with a contractual relationship.” The Restatement (Second) describes this tort as follows:</p>

<p id="66364bec-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">One who intentionally and improperly interferes with the performance of a contract (except a contract to marry) between another and a third person by inducing or otherwise causing the third person not to perform the contract, is subject to liability to the other for the pecuniary loss resulting to the other from the failure of the third person to perform the contract.</p></div>

This is an interesting concept because contract law does not consider the intentional breach by a contracting party as a tort subject to tort remedies. On the other hand, when one who is a stranger to the contract interferes with the performance of the contract, courts consider this to be actionable in tort. Consider the justification for imposing such liability as you read the facts from the famous old English case of <i>Lumley v. Gye</i> below.</p>

<p id="66367309-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question raised upon this demurrer is, Whether an action will lie by the proprietor of a theatre against a person who maliciously procures an entire abandonment of a contract to perform exclusively at that theatre for a certain time; whereby damage was sustained? And it seems to me that it will. The authorities are numerous and uniform, that an action will lie by a master against a person who procures that a servant should unlawfully leave his service. The principle involved in these cases comprises the present; for, there, the right of action in the master arises from the wrongful act of the defendant in procuring that the person hired should break his contract, by putting an end to the relation of employer and employed; and the present case is the same. If it is objected that this class of actions for procuring a breach of contract of hiring rests upon no principle, and ought not to be extended beyond the cases heretofore decided, and that, as those have related to contracts respecting trade, manufactures or household service, and not to performance at a theatre, therefore they are no authority for an action in respect of a contract for such performance; the answer appears to me to be, that the class of cases referred to rests upon the principle that the procurement of the violation of the right is a cause of action, and that, when this principle is applied to a violation of a right arising upon a contract of hiring, the nature of the service contracted for is immaterial. It is clear that the procurement of the violation of a right is a cause of action in all instances where the violation is an actionable wrong, as in violations of a right to property, whether real or personal, or to personal security: he who procures the wrong is a joint wrong-doer, and may be sued, either alone or jointly with the agent, in the appropriate action for the wrong complained of.</p>
<p id="6636730a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This principle is supported by good reason. He who maliciously procures a damage to another by violation of his right ought to be made to indemnify; and that, whether he procures an actionable wrong or a breach of contract. He who procures the non-delivery of goods according to contract may inflict an injury, the same as he who procures the abstraction of goods after delivery; and both ought on the same ground to be made responsible. The remedy on the contract may be inadequate, as where the measures of damages is restricted; or in the ease of non-payment of a debt where the damage may be bankruptcy to the creditor who is disappointed, but the measure of damages against the debtor is interest only; or, in the case of the non-delivery of the goods, the disappointment may lead to a heavy forfeiture under a contract to complete a work within a time, but the measure of damages against the vendor of the goods for non-delivery may be only the difference between the contract price and the market value of the goods in question at the time of the breach. In such cases, he who procures the damage maliciously might justly be made responsible beyond the liability of the contractor.</p>
<p id="6636730b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The result is that there ought to be, in my opinion, judgment for the plaintiff.</p>

<p id="6636730e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Adoption of</i> Lumley <i>Tort</i>.</b> The above decision in <i>Lumley</i> is the most famous decision recognizing a tort cause of action for intentionally interfering with the plaintiff’s contract with a third party. The court recognized that the third party (the opera singer) might be liable for breach of contract but that the actor who instigated the failure to perform would be liable in tort for the damages caused through his intentional act of interference. This principle for liability, while novel in 1853, was fully embraced by both English and American courts over time. While some of the judges in <i>Lumley</i> premised their verdict upon the showing that the defendant had acted maliciously, others believed this was not critical to proving the claim. This dispute has been ongoing. Most courts traditionally identify the elements of tortious interference with contract as follows:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-ucletter">

<p id="66369a23-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One continuing bone of contention has been whether plaintiff must prove a form of “malice”—which is often seen as the opposite of being justified in one’s action by legitimate business interests or rights. Many courts treat this issue as an affirmative defense. Rather than having the plaintiff bear the burden of proving “malice,” the defendant must affirmatively plead and prove that it was justified in its act of interference in order to defeat the claim that otherwise satisfied the foregoing elements. There are still jurisdictions, however, that require the plaintiff to prove malice as an element of the claim (and in effect, to negate any justification or privilege for the defendant’s act of interference).</p>

Utilizing these factors, how might you justify the decision by the court in <i>Lumley</i> to hold the defendant liable to the plaintiff?</p>
<p id="6636c13d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Billion Dollar Cause of Action</i>.</b> One of the largest tort judgments in history involved this cause of action. Pennzoil sued Texaco in Texas state court for interfering with Pennzoil’s contractual relations with Getty Oil Co. Getty and Pennzoil had agreed to Pennzoil’s takeover of Getty through a stock acquisition. Subsequently, Texaco offered (and Getty accepted) a deal to pay a higher dollar amount per share to permit Texaco to take over Getty instead of Pennzoil. Pennzoil sued Texaco and the jury returned a verdict for Pennzoil of $7.53 billion in compensatory damages and $3 billion in punitive damages. On appeal the punitive damages were reduced to $1 billion but the compensatory damages were left intact. The Texas Supreme Court refused to hear any further appeals and Texaco filed for bankruptcy while seeking further appellate review from the U.S. Supreme Court. While these matters were pending, the parties settled the case for a total of $3 billion—a pretty good day at the office for any attorney with a contingency fee interest.</p>
<p id="6636c13e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Triangular Relationships Required</i>.</b> Courts have held that a mere breach of contract does not give rise to a cause of action for tortious interference against the breaching party. In other words, one cannot tortiously interfere with one’s own contract. A third party, who is a stranger to the contract, is the only one capable of committing this tort. <i>See</i> In re James E. Bashaw &amp; Co., 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 5745 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2009, no pet.). In other words, you need a triangular relationship to have this tort. Merely failing to perform, or somehow interfering with the performance of a contract to which the actor is a party, subjects that party only to a breach of contract claim and not a tort claim. <i>See e.g.</i>, Applied Equipment Corp. v. Litton Saudi Arabia Ltd., 869 P.2d 454 (Cal. 1994).</p>
<p id="6636c13f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. <i>Problem</i>.</b> During the summer of 2010, there were news reports that Marist College filed a lawsuit against James Madison University for luring its men’s basketball coach (Matt Brady) away while the coach was in the middle of a multi-year deal (with no buyout clause). Brady spent four years as the coach at Marist before accepting the offer from James Madison. In the suit, Marist alleged that the coach was induced to leave with three years remaining on his current contract. James Madison did not file a timely answer in the suit and a default judgment was entered by New York State Supreme Court Justice Charles D. Wood, who stated that James Madison University had committed “tortious interference” with the contract of employment between Marist and Brady. A subsequent hearing was scheduled to determine the damages. (The school also sued the coach for breach of contract, including violating a provision in the <span title="936" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-936">p. 936</span>contract stating that if Brady left, he would not solicit any current Marist players to leave with him.) The coach filed an answer denying any liability for breach of contract. Did James Madison University have a viable defense to the claim for tortious interference?</p>

<p id="6636e85b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">In a parallel line of cases, courts have also recognized a tort for intentional interference with a <i>merely prospective</i> contractual relationship. While the preceding case specifically rejected the concept of a competition privilege when an actor intentionally interferes with an <i>existing</i> contractual relationship, courts and commentators have long agreed that when the actor’s conduct merely interferes with a claimant’s <i>possible</i> contractual relationship with a third party, competition should not be prohibited. For example, consider two competing manufacturers of soft drink products. When one advertises that its product is better than the other in order to attract customers to its own product and away from the other, do you see how this might appear to be an intentional act of interference with a prospective contractual relationship? In such a scenario, courts in fact find such conduct commendable rather than actionable:</p>

<p id="6636e85c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">“Iron sharpens iron” is ancient wisdom, and the law is in accord in favoring free competition, since ordinarily it is essential to the general welfare of society, notwithstanding [that] competition is not altruistic but is fundamentally the play of interest against interest, and so involves the interference of the successful competitor with the interest of his unsuccessful competitor in the matter of their common rivalry. Competition is the state in which men live and is not a tort, unless <span title="937" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-937">p. 937</span>the nature of the method employed is not justified by public policy, and so supplies the condition to constitute a legal wrong. Accordingly, we have made clear in our cases that acting to pursue one’s own business interests at the expense of others is not, in itself, tortious.</p></div>
<p id="6636e85d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Goldman v. Building Ass’n, 133 A. 843, 846 (Md. 1926). Thus, while expressly embracing competition as a generally acceptable privilege, courts have also embraced the concept that there should be limits to this privilege and that sometimes the act of interference is actionable. The first and second Restatements have struggled to provide a bright line articulating when the act of interference is privileged and when it is not justified “by public policy” and, therefore, provides grounds for legal redress. The following opinion provides historical perspective on the related tort claims of interference with an existing contract versus interference with a mere prospective contact. It also offers an arguably brighter line for determining when competition is justified and when it is not.</p>

<p id="66370f74-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Texas, like most states, has long recognized a tort cause of action for interference with a prospective contractual or business relation even though the core concept of liability—what conduct is prohibited—has never been clearly defined. Texas courts have variously stated that a defendant may be liable for conduct that is “wrongful,” “malicious,” “improper,” of “no useful purpose,” “below the behavior of fair men similarly situated,” or done “with the purpose of harming the plaintiff,” but not for conduct that is “competitive,” “privileged,” or “justified,” even if intended to harm the plaintiff. Repetition of these abstractions in the case law has not imbued them with content or made them more useful, and tensions among them, which exist not only in Texas law but American law generally, have for decades been the subject of considerable critical commentary.</p>
<p id="66370f75-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case affords us the opportunity to bring a measure of clarity to this body of law. From the history of the tort in Texas and elsewhere, and from the scholarly efforts to analyze its boundaries, we conclude that to establish liability for interference with a prospective contractual or business relation the plaintiff must prove that it was harmed by the defendant’s conduct that was either independently tortious or unlawful. By “independently tortious” we mean conduct that would violate some other recognized tort duty. We must explain this at greater length, but by way of example, a defendant who threatened a customer with bodily harm if he did business with the plaintiff would be liable for interference because his conduct toward the customer—assault—was <span title="938" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-938">p. 938</span>independently tortious, while a defendant who competed legally for the customer’s business would not be liable for interference. Thus defined, an action for interference with a prospective contractual or business relation provides a remedy for injurious conduct that other tort actions might not reach (in the example above, the plaintiff could not sue for assault), but only for conduct that is already recognized to be wrongful under the common law or by statute.</p>
<p id="66370f76-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the defendant’s conduct in this case was not independently tortious or unlawful, and because the defendant did not breach its contract, we reverse the court of appeals’ judgment and render judgment for the defendant.</p>

<p id="66370f78-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff Harry W. Sturges, III contracted for himself and plaintiffs Dick Ford, Bruce Whitehead, and J.D. Martin, III to purchase from Bank One, Texas a vacant parcel of commercial property in Nederland, Texas, referred to as Tract 2. The contract, dated December 29, 1989, gave purchasers the right to terminate if within sixty days they were unable to lease the property and “to secure the written approval of Wal-Mart Corporation to the intended use of the Property, in accordance with the right so given to Wal-Mart pursuant to certain restrictions on the Property.” The right referred to was the right to approve modifications in a site plan for the property that Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and Wal-Mart Properties, Inc. (collectively, “Wal-Mart”) held under two recorded instruments, each entitled “Easements with Covenants and Restrictions Affecting Land” (“ECRs”), one filed in 1982 and the other in 1988. The purpose of the ECRs was to assure the commercial development of Tract 2 and an adjacent tract, Tract 1, according to a prescribed plan.</p>
<p id="66370f79-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The 1982 ECR was between Wal-Mart, which owned Tract 2 at the time, and the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio (“OTR”), which owned Tract 1, having acquired it from Wal-Mart under a sale and leaseback agreement. OTR leased Tract 1 to Wal-Mart to use for a store. In 1984, Wal-Mart sold Tract 2 to a joint venture that included a partnership, Gulf Coast Investment Group. Gulf Coast later acquired Tract 2 from the joint venture. The 1988 ECR, made by Gulf Coast, OTR, and Wal-Mart, modified the site plan for the tracts and otherwise incorporated the terms of the 1982 ECR.</p>
<p id="66370f7a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Gulf Coast’s efforts to develop Tract 2 failed, and in 1989 Bank One acquired the property by foreclosure. Two of Gulf Coast’s partners, plaintiffs Whitehead and Martin, along with two other investors, plaintiffs Sturges and Ford, continued to look for a way to develop the property. When Sturges learned that Fleming Foods of Texas, Inc. was interested in building a food store in the area, he contracted with Bank One to purchase Tract 2 for the plaintiffs in hopes of leasing the property to Fleming Foods.</p>
<p id="66370f7b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As soon as the agreement with Bank One was executed, Sturges contacted Wal-Mart to request a modification of the 1982/1988 ECRs to permit construction on Tract 2 of a food store to Fleming’s specifications. A modification was necessary in part because Fleming wanted to construct a 51,000-square-foot <span title="939" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-939">p. 939</span>store, and the site plan permitted only a 36,000-square-foot structure. A manager in Wal-Mart’s property management department, DeLee Wood, told Sturges to submit a revised site plan, and though she did not have authority to approve the modification herself, she indicated to Sturges that Wal-Mart would approve it. About the same time, Sturges obtained from Fleming a non-binding memorandum of understanding that it would lease Tract 2.</p>
<p id="66370f7c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unbeknownst to Wood, a manager in another Wal-Mart department, Sandra Watson, had been evaluating the possibilities for expanding stores at various locations, including the Nederland store. If a store could not be expanded, Watson’s assignment was to consider relocating the store. In July 1989 Watson hired a realtor, Tom Hudson, to help Wal-Mart acquire Tract 2 for purposes of expansion. When Hudson learned of Sturges’s contract with Bank One, he suggested to Watson that Wal-Mart could thwart Sturges’s efforts to purchase the property by refusing to approve the requested modification of the 1982/1988 ECRs. At the time, neither Watson nor Hudson knew of Wood’s conversations with Sturges.</p>
<p id="66370f7d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When Wood’s and Watson’s conflicting activities came to the attention of the head of Wal-Mart’s property management department, Tony Fuller, he agreed with Watson that Wal-Mart should try to acquire Tract 2 and told Wood to deny Sturges’s request to modify the ECR, which she did in a letter to Sturges without explanation. Fuller then instructed Hudson to contact Fleming and communicate Wal-Mart’s desire to expand onto Tract 2. Hudson complied, telling L. G. Callaway, Fleming’s manager of store development who had been working on the deal with Sturges, that if Wal-Mart could not acquire Tract 2, it would close its store on Tract 1 and relocate. Since Fleming was not interested in Tract 2 without a Wal-Mart store next door, Callaway took Hudson’s call to be an ultimatum not to move forward on the proposed lease with Sturges. Consequently, Fleming canceled its letter of intent with Sturges, and the plaintiffs opted out of their contract with Bank One. Several months later, Wal-Mart purchased Tract 2 and expanded its store.</p>
<p id="66370f7e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiffs sued Wal-Mart for tortiously interfering with their prospective lease with Fleming and for breaching the 1982/1988 ECRs by unreasonably refusing to approve the requested site plan modification. The plaintiffs’ actual damages claim under both theories was the same—the profits the plaintiffs would have made on the Fleming lease. The jury found Wal-Mart liable on both theories. Concerning the plaintiffs’ interference claim, the district court submitted to the jury two questions with accompanying instructions as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="66370f7f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Did Wal-Mart wrongfully interfere with Plaintiffs’ prospective contractual agreement to lease the property to Fleming?</p>
<p id="66370f80-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Wrongful interference occurred if (a) there was a reasonable probability that Plaintiffs would have entered into the contractual relation, and (b) Wal-Mart intentionally prevented the contractual relation from occurring with the purpose of harming Plaintiffs.</p>
<p id="66370f81-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Was Wal-Mart’s intentional interference with Plaintiffs’ prospective lease agreement with Fleming justified?</p>
<span title="940" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-940">p. 940</span>
<p id="66370f82-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">An interference is “justified” if a party possesses an interest in the subject matter equal or superior to that of the other party, or if it results from the good faith exercise of a party’s rights, or the good faith exercise of a party’s mistaken belief of its rights.</p></div>
<p id="66370f83-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The jury answered “yes” to the first question and “no” to the second. Wal-Mart offered no objection to this part of the jury charge that is relevant to our consideration of the case. The jury assessed $1 million actual damages on the contract claim and on the interference claim, assessed $500,000 punitive damages on the interference claim, and found that reasonable attorney fees for each side were $145,000. At the plaintiffs’ election, the trial court rendered judgment on the interference claim, awarding actual and punitive damages but not attorney fees.</p>
<p id="66370f84-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All parties appealed. The court of appeals affirmed the award of actual damages but remanded for a retrial of punitive damages, holding that the trial court had improperly excluded evidence offered by the plaintiffs during the punitive damages phase of the trial.</p>

<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="66373695-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b">II</p></div>
<p id="66373696-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Wal-Mart argues that there is no evidence to support the jury’s verdict that it wrongfully interfered with the plaintiffs’ prospective lease with Fleming or that it was not justified in acting as it did. Our analysis of these arguments is complicated because it must be made in light of the jury charge that the district court gave without objection, even though, as we conclude, the charge’s statement of the law was not entirely correct. We will focus on Wal-Mart’s argument that there is no evidence of wrongful interference: that is, in the language of the jury charge, no evidence that Wal-Mart acted “with the purpose of harming Plaintiffs.” To resolve this issue, we must understand what kind of conduct is legally harmful and constitutes tortious interference. Whenever two competitors vie for the same business advantage, as Wal-Mart and Sturges did over the acquisition of Tract 2, one’s success over the other can almost always be said to harm the other. Wal-Mart’s evidentiary challenge here raises the question of what harm must be proved to constitute tortious interference. To answer this question, we look to the historical development of the interference torts in other jurisdictions and in Texas and survey every Texas case involving a claim of intentional interference with prospective relations. We then analyze the evidence in this case.</p>
<p id="66373697-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The origins of civil liability for interference have been traced to Roman law that permitted a man to sue for violence done to members of his household. The common law also recognized such liability as early as the fourteenth century and extended it to include driving away a business’s customers or a church’s donors. But a common-law cause of action was strictly limited to cases in which actual violence or other such improper means were used. For centuries the common law continued to allow civil actions for interference with one’s <span title="941" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-941">p. 941</span>customers or other prospective business relationships, but as the <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> summarizes, “in all of them the actor’s conduct was characterized by violence, fraud or defamation, and was tortious in character.”</p>
<p id="66373698-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The common law departed from this requirement in 1853 in the English case of <i>Lumley v. Gye</i>, which held that liability could be imposed for interference with a contract if the defendant acted “wrongfully and maliciously,” even if the defendant’s conduct was not tortious or illegal. In that case, Gye induced an opera singer to sing for him instead of Lumley, for whom she had contracted to perform, not with threats of violence but by offering her a higher fee. Forty years later in <i>Temperton v. Russell</i>, the English court reaffirmed its decision in <i>Lumley</i>, holding that trade union officials could be liable to a building materials supplier for threatening his customers with labor disturbances if they continued to purchase supplies from him. The court announced that the rule in <i>Lumley</i> would apply not only to interference with all contracts, regardless of the subject matter, but to interference with prospective or potential relations as well.</p>
<p id="66373699-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Temperton</i>’s treatment of interference with prospective relations as simply another aspect of interference with contract was a mistake. It is one thing for <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> to compete for <i>C</i>’s business, and quite another for <i>A</i> to persuade or force <i>C</i> to break his contract with <i>B</i>. Tortious interference with contract contemplates that competition may be lawful and yet limited by promises already made. Absent any such promises, competitors should be free to use any lawful means to obtain advantage. As one commentator has observed:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="6637369a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Although one who interferes with the stability of a contractual relationship may be seen as an interloper and possibly a tortfeasor, one who interferes merely with a “prospective business advantage” may be essentially a competitor. In an economic system founded upon the principle of free competition, competitors should not be liable in tort for seeking a legitimate business advantage.<sup>17</sup></p></div>
<p id="6637369b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Lumley</i>’s holding that unlawful conduct was not a prerequisite for liability for tortious interference with contract was understandable; <i>Temperton</i>’s extension of the same rule to situations involving only prospective relations was not.</p>
<p id="6637369c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The use of “malice” to denote the touchstone of liability for tortious interference with contract was not well explained in <i>Lumley</i> and the cases that followed. “Malice” appeared at first to signify malevolence, although it soon became apparent that that definition would not work. As we have explained in a similar context, lawful conduct is not made tortious by the actor’s ill will towards another, nor does an actor’s lack of ill will make his tortious conduct any less so. “Malice” obviously meant that character of conduct that would not justify inducing a breach of contract, but that was an obviously circular definition (a person is not justified in inducing a breach of contract if he acts with malice, that is, if he acts in such a way that does not justify inducing a breach of contract). Exactly what conduct was culpable, and therefore “malicious,” went undefined.</p>
<span title="942" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-942">p. 942</span>
<p id="6637369d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As clumsy as the idea of “malice” was in describing liability for tortious interference with contract, it made no sense at all in trying to describe liability for tortious interference with prospective advantage. Competitors could quite naturally be expected, well within the bounds of law, to try to achieve the best for themselves and, consequently, harm to each other. In a society built around business competition, interference with prospective business relations has never been thought to be wrongful in and of itself. That some liability factor was essential has never been in doubt. If that factor was not unlawful conduct, discarded by <i>Lumley</i> for tortious interference with contract, then it was not clear what it should be.</p>
<p id="6637369e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These two problems—the misassociation of the two torts and the confusion regarding their standards of liability—may have been due to, and were certainly exacerbated by, the concept of a prima facie tort that was being advanced about the same time. As explained by Justice Holmes: “It has been considered that, prima facie, the intentional infliction of temporal damages is a cause of action, which, as a matter of substantive law, whatever may be the form of pleading, requires a justification if the defendant is to escape.” In other words, intentionally inflicting harm is tortious unless justified. Consistent with this idea, and with the association of the two interference torts, the 1939 <i>Restatement of Torts</i> defined tortious interference as simply this:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="6637369f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">One who, without a privilege to do so, induces or otherwise purposely causes a third person not to (a) perform a contract with another, or (b) enter into or continue a business relation with another is liable to the other for the harm caused thereby.</p></div>
<p id="663736a0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">In determining the existence of a privilege, the <i>Restatement</i> called for consideration of:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="66375cb1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">(a) the nature of the actor’s conduct, (b) the nature of the expectancy with which his conduct interferes, (c) the relations between the parties, (d) the interest sought to be advanced by the actor and (e) the social interests in protecting the expectancy on the one hand and the actor’s freedom of action on the other hand.</p></div>
<p id="66375cb2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Restatement</i> also stated a privilege for competition when, among other things, “the actor does not employ improper means.” The <i>Restatement</i>’s broad statements did almost nothing to define the parameters of tortious conduct. What was it about the nature of an actor’s conduct, or of the expectancy at issue, or of any of the other considerations that should or should not result in liability in specific circumstances? Were the considerations the same for interference with a contract and interference with a prospective business relation? When were means of competition “improper”? The <i>Restatement</i>’s provisions gave no more guidance than the concept of prima facie tort. Not <span title="943" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-943">p. 943</span>surprisingly, when the second <i>Restatement</i> was published forty years later, it commented:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="66375cb3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">There is no clear cut distinction between the requirements for a prima facie case and the requirements for a recognized privilege. Initial liability depends upon the interplay of several factors and is not reducible to a single rule; and privileges, too, are not clearly established but depend upon a consideration of much the same factors. Moreover, there is considerable disagreement on who has the burden of pleading and proving certain matters, such for example, as the existence and effect of competition for prospective business.</p>
<p id="66375cb4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This has occurred for two reasons. First, the law in this area has not fully congealed but is still in a formative stage. The several forms of the [interference] tort…are often not distinguished by the courts, and cases have been cited among them somewhat indiscriminately. This has produced a blurring of the significance of the factors involved in determining liability.</p>
<p id="66375cb5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second reason grows out of use of the term “malicious” in [<i>Lumley v. Gye</i>] and other early cases. It soon came to be realized that the term was not being used in a literal sense, requiring ill will toward the plaintiff as a requirement for imposing liability. Many courts came to call this “legal malice,” and to hold that in this sense the requirement means that the infliction of the harm must be intentional and “without justification.” “Justification” is a broader and looser term than “privilege,” and the consequence has been that its meaning has not been very clear.</p></div>
<p id="66375cb6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having recognized these problems, the <i>Restatement</i> did little to solve them. Concluding that “it has seemed desirable to make use of a single word that will indicate for this tort the balancing process expressed by the two terms, ‘culpable and not justified,’” the <i>Restatement</i> chose “improper” as a word “neutral enough to acquire a specialized meaning of its own” for purposes of defining the interference torts. The <i>Restatement</i> separated interference with contract and interference with prospective business relations, previously combined as one, but it used the same new standard—“improper”—to define liability for each.</p>
<p id="66375cb7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, the second <i>Restatement</i> abandoned the confusing and overlapping notions of “malice,” “privilege,” and “justification,” but it made little more than a formal distinction between the two interference torts, setting the liability standard for both at “improper” conduct, and it continued the idea that the considerations for determining what was improper were, except for lawful competition, similar for both torts. Commentators since have criticized the <i>Restatement</i> as overstating case law. Professor Perlman’s analysis of the cases suggests that the interference tort [with prospective relations] should be limited to cases in which the defendant’s acts are independently unlawful and that if improper motivation is to give rise to liability, it should be based only on objective indicia of activity producing social loss. In most cases, tort law will provide the standard for judging the unlawfulness of the means. At the same time, those courts that have emphasized unlawful means have recognized that sources <span title="944" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-944">p. 944</span>other than traditional tort law also might define the lawfulness of the defendant’s behavior. Incorporation of such sources seems right.</p>
<p id="66375cb8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Likewise, Professor Keeton summarized:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="66375cb9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Violence or intimidation, defamation, injurious falsehood or other fraud, violation of the criminal law, and the institution or threat of groundless civil suits or criminal prosecutions in bad faith, all have been held to result in liability, and there is some authority which limits liability to such cases.</p></div>
<p id="66375cba-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two recent cases of note have echoed the same idea after surveying existing case law. In <i>Della Penna v. Toyota Motor Sales, Inc.</i>, a car manufacturer required dealers not to sell its vehicles for resale outside the United States in order to protect its dealership network. An exporter sued the manufacturer for tortious interference with his business prospects. The Supreme Court of California rejected the claim as a matter of law, concluding that the manufacturer’s conduct was not actionable. Abandoning notions of “malice” and “justification,” the court held that a plaintiff seeking to recover for an alleged interference with prospective contractual or economic relations must plead and prove as part of its case-in-chief that the defendant not only knowingly interfered with the plaintiff’s expectancy, but engaged in conduct that was wrongful by some legal measure other than the fact of interference itself.</p>
<p id="66375cbb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The “legal measures” identified by the court were existing tort law and statutes.</p>
<p id="66375cbc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, in <i>Speakers of Sport, Inc. v. Proserv, Inc.</i>, the Seventh Circuit concluded that under Illinois law, actionable interference requires conduct that is independently tortious by nature. In that case, one sports agency sued another for interference in obtaining Texas Rangers’ catcher Ivan Rodriguez as a client by promising him more than it could deliver. The plaintiff agency sought damages alleging that the defendant agency’s conduct was unfair, unethical, and deceitful. The court rejected the argument that actionable interference could be based on conduct that was not independently tortious or otherwise unlawful. As Judge Posner explained in the court’s opinion, no other workable basis exists for distinguishing between tortious interference and lawful competition:</p>
<p id="663783cd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It can be argued…that competition can be tortious even if it does not involve an actionable fraud…or other independently tortious act, such as defamation, or trademark or patent infringement, or a theft of a trade secret; that competitors should not be allowed to use “unfair” tactics; and that a promise known by the promisor when made to be unfulfillable is such a tactic, especially when used on a relatively unsophisticated, albeit very well to do, baseball player. Considerable support for this view can be found in the case law. But the Illinois courts have not as yet embraced the doctrine, and we are not alone in thinking it pernicious. <i>Della Penna v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc.</i>, 902 P.2d 740, 760- 763 (Cal. 1995) (concurring opinion). We agree with Professor Perlman that the tort of interference with business relationships should be confined to cases in which <span title="945" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-945">p. 945</span>the defendant employed unlawful means to stiff a competitor, and we are reassured by the conclusion of his careful analysis that the case law is generally consistent with this position as a matter of outcomes as distinct from articulation.</p>
<p id="663783ce-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Expressly endorsing the legal commentary critical of the development of the law of tortious interference, <i>Della Penna</i> and <i>Speakers of Sport</i> demonstrate the importance of decoupling interference with contract from interference with prospective relations, and of grounding liability for the latter in conduct that is independently tortious by nature or otherwise unlawful.</p>
<p id="663783cf-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We therefore hold that to recover for tortious interference with a prospective business relation a plaintiff must prove that the defendant’s conduct was independently tortious or wrongful. By independently tortious we do not mean that the plaintiff must be able to prove an independent tort. Rather, we mean only that the plaintiff must prove that the defendant’s conduct would be actionable under a recognized tort. Thus, for example, a plaintiff may recover for tortious interference from a defendant who makes fraudulent statements about the plaintiff to a third person without proving that the third person was actually defrauded. If, on the other hand, the defendant’s statements are not intended to deceive, as in <i>Speakers of Sport</i>, then they are not actionable. Likewise, a plaintiff may recover for tortious interference from a defendant who threatens a person with physical harm if he does business with the plaintiff. The plaintiff need prove only that the defendant’s conduct toward the prospective customer would constitute assault. Also, a plaintiff could recover for tortious interference by showing an illegal boycott, although a plaintiff could not recover against a defendant whose persuasion of others not to deal with the plaintiff was lawful. Conduct that is merely “sharp” or unfair is not actionable and cannot be the basis for an action for tortious interference with prospective relations, and we disapprove of cases that suggest the contrary. These examples are not exhaustive, but they illustrate what conduct can constitute tortious interference with prospective relations.</p>
<p id="663783d0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The concepts of justification and privilege are subsumed in the plaintiff’s proof, except insofar as they may be defenses to the wrongfulness of the alleged conduct. For example, a statement made against the plaintiff, though defamatory, may be protected by a complete or qualified privilege. Justification and privilege are defenses in a claim for tortious interference with prospective relations only to the extent that they are defenses to the independent tortiousness of the defendant’s conduct. Otherwise, the plaintiff need not prove that the defendant’s conduct was not justified or privileged, nor can a defendant assert such defenses.</p>
<p id="663783d1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In reaching this conclusion we treat tortious interference with prospective business relations differently than tortious interference with contract. It makes sense to require a defendant who induces a breach of contract to show some justification or privilege for depriving another of benefits to which the agreement entitled him. But when two parties are competing for interests to which neither is entitled, then neither can be said to be more justified or privileged in <span title="946" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-946">p. 946</span>his pursuit. If the conduct of each is lawful, neither should be heard to complain that mere unfairness is actionable. Justification and privilege are not useful concepts in assessing interference with prospective relations, as they are in assessing interference with an existing contract.</p>

<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="663783d2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b">III</p></div>
<p id="663783d3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With this understanding of what conduct is prohibited by the tort of interference with prospective contractual or business relations and what conduct is not prohibited, we return to the evidence of this case. As we have already noted, we must assess Wal-Mart’s argument that no evidence supports a finding of wrongful interference with the plaintiffs’ prospective agreement with Fleming Foods in light of the jury charge to which Wal-Mart did not object, even though the charge does not correctly state the law. We must therefore consider whether the plaintiffs offered any evidence from which the jury could find, as the trial court instructed them, that Wal-Mart acted “with the purpose of harming Plaintiffs.” As we have shown, however, harm that results only from lawful competition is not compensable by the interference tort. We must look to see whether there is evidence of harm from some independently tortious or unlawful activity by Wal-Mart.</p>
<p id="663783d4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiffs tell us that their interference claim is based on the telephone conversation between Hudson, Wal-Mart’s relator, and Callaway, Fleming’s manager of store development. Specifically, the plaintiffs complain of Hudson’s “ultimatum” to Callaway that if Wal-Mart were not able to acquire Tract 2 for expansion, it would relocate its store. The plaintiffs contend that Hudson’s statement was false and therefore fraudulent. To be fraudulent a statement must be material and false, the speaker must have known it was false or acted recklessly without regard to its falsity, the speaker must have intended that the statement be acted on, and hearer must have relied on it. The plaintiffs do not dispute that Wal-Mart had undertaken to identify stores which could not be expanded and to relocate them, that it attempted to acquire Tract 2 as an alternative to relocating the Nederland store, and that as Hudson told Callaway, if Wal-Mart could not acquire Tract 2 it would relocate. The only evidence the plaintiffs cite in support of their contention is that at the time Hudson called Callaway Wal-Mart had not begun efforts to relocate; that as a general matter Wal-Mart preferred to expand rather than relocate; and that there was room on Tract 1 for some expansion of the store. The fact that Wal-Mart had not begun to relocate its store when Hudson talked with Callaway is no evidence that his statement was false. The plaintiffs point to no evidence that Wal-Mart’s general preference for expansion over relocation, or the possibilities for some expansion on Tract 1, would have made it decide not to relocate. Indeed, if Tract 1 had been adequate for Wal-Mart’s intended expansion, it would not have needed to acquire Tract 2.</p>
<p id="663783d5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, no evidence supports the plaintiffs’ contention that Hudson’s statement to Callaway was fraudulent or that Hudson intended to deceive Callaway, <span title="947" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-947">p. 947</span>and the plaintiffs do not contend that Wal-Mart’s conduct was otherwise illegal or tortious. The record contains no evidence to indicate that Wal-Mart intended the plaintiffs any harm other than what they would necessarily suffer by Wal-Mart’s successful acquisition of Tract 2, which they were both pursuing, by entirely lawful means. We therefore conclude that there is no evidence to support a judgment for the plaintiffs on their interference claim.</p>

<p id="663783d8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Decoupling the Two Interference Torts</i>.</b> The above court “decouples” these two related tort claims in the opinion, indicating that the concept of “justification” makes sense for a defendant to attempt to explain its intentional interference with an existing contractual relationship, but that no such burden should be placed on a defendant who has merely interfered with a prospective relationship. In the latter case, to recover, the plaintiff must also demonstrate that the <i>means employed</i> by the defendant involved conduct that was <i>independently unlawful or tortious</i>—in other words, one must find a tort within the tort.</p>
<p id="663783d9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Breach of Contract as Wrongful Conduct</i>.</b> In another portion of the opinion, the <i>Wal-Mart</i> court also finds (as a matter of contract interpretation) that the defendant had not committed any breach of contract through the alleged “unreasonable” failure to agree to the modification of the easements and covenants. Interestingly, the court only appeared to reach this issue for the purpose of evaluating the jury’s finding of a cause of action for contract breach, rather than suggesting that an intentional act of interference involving the defendant’s own breach of a separate contract might be sufficient evidence of “wrongful” conduct. This is consistent with the holdings of some other courts—the fact that the defendant breached a contract with a third party in the course of interfering with the plaintiff’s prospective relationship does not itself make the interference tortious. Breach of a contract is not illegal, improper, wrongful, or unjustified under the law of tort, but instead simply gives rise to a claim for breach of contract. <i>See</i> Windsor Securities, Inc. v. Hartford Life Ins. Co., 986 F.2d 655, 664 (3d Cir. 1993).</p>
<p id="663783da-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>At-Will Employment Relationships</i>.</b> Most courts treat contracts terminable at will as the equivalent of a prospective contractual relationship because there is no assurance the relationship would continue. Given the <i>Wal-Mart</i> court’s distinction between the torts of interference with an existing contract versus interference with a prospective contract, do you understand why characterizing the at-will relationship in this manner is so important? Consider this scenario. Competitor calls at-will Employee and recruits her to quit her job with Employer and go to work for Competitor.

<p id="6637aaf1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Restatement (Second) §768 (1965). Note that this privilege to compete is expressly limited to interference with <i>prospective</i> and not existing contractual relations. The <i>Wal-Mart</i> court found this articulation of a privilege unwieldy in terms of differentiating between acceptable and unacceptable conduct. Many courts still analyze interference with prospective contractual relations, however, utilizing this foregoing Restatement (Second)’s list of factors. In adhering to this Restatement test some courts have focused more upon a finding of an improper <i>motive</i>, and others upon whether the defendant utilized improper <i>means</i> in the act of interference. The Restatement itself does not say which of the multiple factors is most important, much less how a court should go about considering these factors. To that extent, the Restatement is less of a test and more of a list of variables. By contrast, the modern trend illustrated by the <i>Wal-Mart</i> case narrows the analysis considerably and likely creates an actual test that can be more predictive of outcomes. Which analysis do you find more helpful—the Restatement (Second)’s list of factors, or the <i>Wal-Mart</i> court’s limitation of the tort to acts of interference involving conduct independently recognized as tortious or wrongful?</p>

<p id="6637aaf5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">In several instances in this chapter we have briefly discussed how a business tort cause of action might be preferable to a breach of contract action for the aggrieved claimant. Plaintiff lawyers have recognized this as well and have increasingly become more aggressive in attempting to plead tort claims rather than, or in addition to, their contract causes of action. At some level, for example, you might argue that many broken promises stem from a lack of care taken by the promisor. In that event, can one argue that the contract breach could also be considered negligent performance of the contract? Or could the breach also involve grossly negligent performance? In the following case the court grappled with how to distinguish between a tort and a contract action in instances where the proof of the tort claim necessarily also involved conduct constituting a contract breach.</p>

[After plaintiff Delanney rested his case in chief, defendant Bell moved for a directed verdict, but the trial court denied the motion as to the negligence claim and submitted the case to the jury.]</p>
<p id="6637d20f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The jury found that Bell was negligent in omitting DeLanney’s advertisement from the Yellow Pages and that such negligence was a proximate cause of damages to DeLanney. The jury assessed these damages at $109,000 for lost profits in the past and $40,000 for lost profits in the future. After ordering a partial remittitur which reduced future lost profits to $21,480, the trial court rendered judgment for DeLanney. Bell appealed.</p>
<p id="6637d210-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court of appeals, with one justice concurring and one justice dissenting, affirmed. A majority of the court held that Bell’s cancellation of DeLanney’s Yellow Pages advertisement was correctly submitted as a negligence claim. The dissenting justice argued that because DeLanney sought damages for breach of a duty created under the contract, rather than a duty imposed by law, the claim sounded only in contract. We agree with the dissent.</p>
<p id="6637d211-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority below relied on <i>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. v. Scharrenbeck</i>, 204 S.W.2d 508, 510 (Tex. 1947), where we quoted from 38 Am. Jur. Negligence §20 (1941) as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="6637d212-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Accompanying every contract is a common-law duty to perform with care, skill, reasonable expedience and faithfulness the thing agreed to be done, and a negligent failure to observe any of these conditions is a tort, as well as a breach of the contract.</p></div>
<p id="6637d213-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Scharrenbeck</i>, the defendant agreed to repair a water heater in plaintiff’s home. A short time after repair, the heater ignited the roof, destroying the house and its contents. Although the contract obligated the defendant to put the water heater back in good working order, the law also implied a duty to the defendant to act with reasonable skill and diligence in making the repairs so as not to injure a person or property by his performance. In failing to repair the water heater properly, the defendant breached its contract. In burning down plaintiff’s home, the defendant breached a common-law duty as well, thereby providing a basis for plaintiff’s recovery in tort.</p>
<p id="6637d214-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The principle recognized in <i>Scharrenbeck</i> has also been recognized by commentators in this area. As one prominent authority has explained: “Tort obligations are in general obligations that are imposed by law—apart from and independent of promises made and therefore apart from the manifested intention of the parties—to avoid injury to others.” W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on The Law of Torts §92 at 655 (5th Ed. 1984) <span title="951" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-951">p. 951</span>[hereinafter “Prosser and Keeton”]. If the defendant’s conduct—such as negligently burning down a house—would give rise to liability independent of the fact that a contract exists between the parties, the plaintiff’s claim may also sound in tort. Conversely, if the defendant’s conduct—such as falling to publish an advertisement—would give rise to liability only because it breaches the parties’ agreement, the plaintiff’s claim ordinarily sounds only in contract.</p>
<p id="6637d215-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In determining whether the plaintiff may recover on a tort theory, it is also instructive to examine the nature of the plaintiff’s loss. When the only loss or damage is to the subject matter of the contract, the plaintiff’s action is ordinarily on the contract. <i>See</i> Prosser and Keeton at 656; 1 J. Edgar, Jr. &amp; J. Sales, Texas Torts and Remedies §1.03[4][b] at 1-36 (1990). We applied this analysis in <i>Jim Walter Homes, Inc. v. Reed</i>, 711 S.W.2d 617, 618 (Tex. 1986), where we wrote:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="6637d216-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">The acts of a party may breach duties in tort or contract alone or simultaneously in both. The nature of the injury most often determines which duty or duties are breached. When the injury is only the economic loss to the subject of a contract itself the action sounds in contract alone.</p></div>
<p id="6637d217-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Bell’s duty to publish DeLanney’s advertisement arose solely from the contract. DeLanney’s damages, lost profits, were only for the economic loss caused by Bell’s failure to perform. Although DeLanney pleaded his action as one in negligence, he clearly sought to recover the benefit of his bargain with Bell. We hold that Bell’s failure to publish the advertisement was not a tort. Under our analysis in Reed, DeLanney’s claim was solely in contract. [The court found that the plaintiff had waived any contract claim by failing to submit jury questions on that cause of action.]</p>
<p id="6637d218-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and judgment is rendered that DeLanney take nothing.</p>

<p id="6637f92a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I agree with the court that Bell’s failure to publish the advertisement was not a tort and that it sounded solely in contract. I also agree that DeLanney failed to discharge his burden to obtain affirmative findings to jury questions on the contract. However, I do not fault the court of appeals for its confusion. We have muddled the law of “contorts” and an all encompassing bright line demarcation of what constitutes a tort distinct from breach of contract has proven to be elusive. See generally W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, The Law of Torts §1 (5th ed. 1984).</p>
<p id="6637f92b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">DeLanney and the court of appeals rely heavily on the statement in <i>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. v. Scharrenbeck</i>, 146 Tex. 153, 204 S.W.2d 508, 510 (Tex. 1947), that:</p>

<p id="6637f92d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite this broad language, not every breach of contract accompanied by negligence creates a cause of action in tort. In <i>International Printing Pressman &amp; Assistants’ Union v. Smith</i>, 145 Tex. 399, 198 S.W.2d 729, 735 (Tex. 1946), we acknowledged that no single concise rule will define the rights of parties in every situation. We nonetheless wrote:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="6637f92e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Generally speaking, “actions in contract and in tort are to be distinguished in that an action in contract is for the breach of a duty arising out of a contract either express or implied, while an action in tort is for a breach of duty imposed by law.…” “If the action is not maintainable without pleading and proving the contract, where the gist of the action is the breach of the contract, either by malfeasance or nonfeasance, it is, in substance an action on the contract, whatever may be the form of the pleading.” (citations omitted).</p></div>
<p id="6637f92f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Id.</i> at 735. I believe that this formulation comes closer than <i>Scharrenbeck</i> to stating a general rule to distinguish contract from tort and that the broad language in <i>Scharrenbeck</i> must be read in light of the particular circumstances of that case. The opinion in <i>Scharrenbeck</i> is correct in its observation that a contract may be the occasion that brings the parties together, but it is the relationship or situation of the parties that gives rise to a duty in law, the breach of which is a tort. Had Montgomery Ward repaired the water heater gratuitously, it would have owed <i>Scharrenbeck</i>a duty not to create a dangerous condition. Thus the duty to not create a dangerous condition existed independent of any contractual relationship.</p>
<p id="6637f930-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In summary, when a party must prove the contents of its contract and must rely on the duties created therein, the action is “in substance an action on the contract, even though it is denominated an action for negligent performance of the contract.” <i>Bernard Johnson, Inc. v.

Notice the reference early in the opinion to a liquidated damages clause in the Yellow Pages contract. On a tort claim this would not cap the recovery of full compensatory damages like it might in a contract breach action. In other instances, the tort versus contract issue may arise because the claimant might try to sue on a tort theory in order to try to justify a submission of a punitive damage question to the jury.</p>

<p id="6638204c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">While many law students (and members of the public) perceive torts as solely related to personal injury or property damage claims, in fact there are increasing numbers of tort suits filed by businesses against other businesses. For the lawyer who enjoys having clients rich enough to pay high hourly fees, yet yearns to represent plaintiffs, the world of business torts can be quite enticing, because corporations are just as likely to be claimants as defendants in this area. Many, though not all, of the business torts litigated today arise in the context of contractual relationships; a recurring theme, therefore, in business torts concerns whether and when to recognize a tort claim rather than relegating the parties to the world of contract law. Despite many business tort causes of action being quite ancient, their modern adaptation and interpretation had led to this area being uniquely in flux. For those students of the law who enjoy grappling with complex issues, business torts can be very enjoyable. While there are many business tort causes of action that we simply do not <span title="954" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-954">p. 954</span>have time to encounter here (e.g., misappropriation of trade secrets, business disparagement, breach of fiduciary duty, commercial defamation), the claim that has long predominated in this field concerns a common law claim for fraud. Fraud permeates the law and its study can be endless. Understanding what types of statements (or conduct) are considered misrepresentations is the beginning point in any fraud analysis. Further, fault and justifiable reliance are elements that can be daunting in many factual scenarios. And while negligent misrepresentation can often be brought in cases that involve conduct close to fraud, this cause of action has some significant limitations in its application—most notably, concerning the issue of duty. Finally, while it is clear that only intentional and not negligent claims of interference with contract will be considered by the courts, the analytical distinctions between interference with existing contracts and interference with prospective contracts has caused great angst for lawyers and litigants trying to understand their rights.</p>

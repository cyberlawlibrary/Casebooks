<p id="658cc550-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Many torts classes begin with a study of a category of tort claims entitled “intentional torts.” And this book will do likewise. This chapter will explore many of the classic intentional tort claims. These stalwarts of tort law include battery, assault, false imprisonment, and trespass. Another important, though relatively new, tort cause of action will also be covered in this chapter—intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>

<p id="658cec64-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Beyond this category of intentional torts, two other general categories of tort claims exist: accidental torts (divided between claims involving recklessness and ordinary negligence) and strict liability torts (often called a “no fault” cause of action). These other varieties of tort claims will be covered in subsequent chapters.</p>

<p id="658cec65-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of the three broad categories of tort claims, intentional tort claims are <i>generally</i> considered to involve the worst, most reprehensible misconduct, though as you will see, this does not always ring true. This category is referred to as “intentional” because the tortfeasor must <i>intend something specific</i>, subjectively, in order to trigger liability. But exactly what it is that has to be intended by the tortfeasor varies widely among the various intentional tort claims. Some intentional tort claims require that something relatively bad be intended, such as “outrageous conduct,” but others do not require such malevolent intent. The point is that for each intentional tort claim, as you are learning the elements of the claim, you need to pay close attention to what exactly must be intended, and what elements need not be intended.</p>
<p id="658cec66-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because intentional tort claims often involve quite reprehensible misconduct, in addition to claims for recovery of actual, “compensatory” damages, plaintiffs suing on intentional tort theories often include an additional prayer for “punitive” or exemplary damages. Such damages are covered extensively later in this book but, for now, just be aware that punitive damages are exceptional, awarded only in a small percentage of tort claims, and are designed specifically to punish the tortfeasor rather than to provide compensation to the tort victim.</p>

<p id="658d137b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Battery is a classic intentional tort. You have probably heard the phrase “assault and battery.” Assault is technically a different, though related, tort from battery. You will need to learn how they are related but separate. Battery is designed to protect our bodily integrity; that is, our right to be free from certain unwanted physical contacts. We are daily faced with physical contacts from others, most of which are desired, unnoticed, or harmless. But certain other contacts might be physically harmful to us or unpleasant and disagreeable. The tort of battery <span title="19" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-19">p. 19</span>recognizes that we are entitled to some level of autonomy over our own bodies. It provides redress where that autonomy is violated in certain ways. Pay close attention to the elements of this cause of action as you read the next set of cases. Also remember that the same notion of autonomy that gives rise to a tort claim for battery when we are subjected to unwanted contacts, also necessarily gives rise to the consent defense where we have permitted contacts to occur, even where they later turn out to be harmful. The separate defense of consent is covered along with other defenses to intentional torts in the next chapter.</p>

<div id="658d137c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="658d137d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b">B.&nbsp;Intent</p></h3></div>

<p id="658d137e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">The elements of a civil cause of action are those things that the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that are considered essential to the claim. If any element is lacking, the plaintiff’s cause of action fails. You might consider the elements of a tort claim to be analogous to the necessary ingredients in a recipe. Leaving out one key ingredient means that you have not succeeded in preparing your dish. For each tort cause of action, you should look within the case opinions you are reading for some indication of the elements or key ingredients. In most of the cases the parties are disputing whether the factual record supports the existence of a particular element.</p>
<p id="658d137f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As already mentioned, every intentional tort claim requires something specific to be intended. How courts interpret and apply the word “intent” in the context of intentional torts is not entirely intuitive for law students. Battery is an intentional tort and our first case will begin to delineate what is meant in tort law by the word <i>intent</i>. One meaning—a desire to bring about a certain result—is the definition of intent you have used in your pre-law school life. There is an additional definition that might surprise you. The <i>Garratt</i> case below discusses these two traditional meanings of the word “intent.” <i>These dual meanings apply with equal force to any intentional tort claim</i>. Thus, while different intentional tort claims involve something different being intended, once you grasp the concept of intent you will be equipped to analyze any intentional tort. With respect to the claim for battery, begin to focus upon what exactly must be intended. This will be a subject revisited within this section, as the final case on battery—<i>White v. Muniz</i>—will come back and provide an important final clarification.</p>

<p id="658d3a96-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The liability of an infant for an alleged battery is presented to this court for the first time. Brian Dailey (age five years, nine months) was visiting with Naomi Garratt, an adult and a sister of the plaintiff, Ruth Garratt, likewise an adult, in <span title="20" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-20">p. 20</span>the backyard of the plaintiff’s home, on July 16, 1951. It is plaintiff’s contention that she came out into the backyard to talk with Naomi and that, as she started to sit down in a wood and canvas lawn chair, Brian deliberately pulled it out from under her. The only one of the three persons present so testifying was Naomi Garratt. (Ruth Garratt, the plaintiff, did not testify as to how or why she fell.) The trial court, unwilling to accept this testimony, adopted instead Brian Dailey’s version of what happened, and made the following findings:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="658d3a97-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">III.…that while Naomi Garratt and Brian Dailey were in the back yard the plaintiff, Ruth Garratt, came out of her house into the back yard. Some time subsequent thereto defendant, Brian Dailey, picked up a lightly built wood and canvas lawn chair which was then and there located in the back yard of the above described premises, moved it sideways a few feet and seated himself therein, at which time he discovered the plaintiff, Ruth Garratt, about to sit down at the place where the lawn chair had formerly been, at which time he hurriedly got up from the chair and attempted to move it toward Ruth Garratt to aid her in sitting down in the chair; that due to the defendant’s small size and lack of dexterity he was unable to get the lawn chair under the plaintiff in time to prevent her from falling to the ground. That plaintiff fell to the ground and sustained a fracture of her hip, and other injuries and damages as hereinafter set forth.</p>
<p id="658d61a8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">IV. That the preponderance of the evidence in this case establishes that when the defendant, Brian Dailey, moved the chair in question <i>he did not have any wilful or unlawful purpose</i> in doing so; that <i>he did not have any intent to injure the plaintiff, or any intent to bring about any unauthorized or offensive contact with her person</i> or any objects appurtenant thereto; that the circumstances which immediately preceded the fall of the plaintiff established that the defendant, <i>Brian Dailey, did not have purpose, intent or design to perform a prank or to effect an assault and battery upon the person of the plaintiff</i>. (Italics ours, for a purpose hereinafter indicated.)</p></div>
<p id="658d61a9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is conceded that Ruth Garratt’s fall resulted in a fractured hip and other painful and serious injuries. To obviate the necessity of a retrial in the event this court determines that she was entitled to a judgment against Brian Dailey, the amount of her damage was found to be eleven thousand dollars. Plaintiff appeals from a judgment dismissing the action and asks for the entry of a judgment in that amount or a new trial.</p>
<p id="658d61aa-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The authorities generally, but with certain notable exceptions (<i>See</i> Bohlen, <i>“Liability in Tort of Infants and Insane Persons,”</i> 23 Mich. L. Rev. 9), state that, when a minor has committed a tort with force, he is liable to be proceeded against as any other person would be. <i>Paul v. Hummel</i> (1868), 43 Mo. 119, 97 Am. Dec. 381; <i>Huchting v. Engel</i> (1863), 17 Wis. 237, 84 Am. Dec. 741; <i>Briese v. Maechtle</i> (1911), 146 Wis. 89, 130 N. W. 893; 1 Cooley on Torts (4th ed.) 194, §66; Prosser on Torts 1085, §108; 2 Kent’s Commentaries 241; 27 Am. Jur. 812, Infants, §90.</p>
<p id="658d61ab-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our analysis of the applicable law, we start with the basic premise that Brian, whether five or fifty-five, must have committed some wrongful act before he could be liable for appellant’s injuries.</p>

<p id="658d61ac-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is urged that Brian’s action in moving the chair constituted a battery. A definition (not all-inclusive but sufficient for our purpose) of a battery is the intentional infliction of a harmful bodily contact upon another. The rule that determines liability for battery is given in 1 Restatement, Torts, 29, §13, as:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="658d61ad-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An act which, directly or indirectly, is the legal cause of a harmful contact with another’s person makes the actor liable to the other, if</p>
<p id="658d61ae-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(a) the act is done with the intention of bringing about a harmful or offensive contact to the other, and</p>
<p id="658d88bf-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(b) the contact is not consented to by the other [or the other’s consent thereto is procured by fraud or duress], and</p>
<p id="658d88c0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(c) the contact is not otherwise privileged.</p></div>
<p id="658d88c1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have in this case no question of consent or privilege. We therefore proceed to an immediate consideration of intent and its place in the law of battery. In the comment on clause (a), the Restatement says:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="658d88c2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush"><i>Character of actor’s intention</i>. In order that an act may be done with the intention of bringing about a harmful or offensive contact or an apprehension thereof to a particular person, either the other or a third person, the act must be done for the purpose of causing the contact or apprehension or with knowledge on the part of the actor that such contact or apprehension is substantially certain to be produced.</p></div>
<p id="658d88c3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have here the conceded volitional act of Brian, <i>i.e.</i>, the moving of a chair. Had the plaintiff proved to the satisfaction of the trial court that Brian moved the chair while she was in the act of sitting down, Brian’s action would patently have been for the purpose or with the intent of causing the plaintiff’s bodily contact with the ground, and she would be entitled to a judgment against him for the resulting damages. <i>Vosburg v. Putney</i> (1891), 80 Wis. 523, 50 N. W. 403; <i>Briese v. Maechtle, supra</i>.</p>
<p id="658d88c4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff based her case on that theory, and the trial court held that she failed in her proof and accepted Brian’s version of the facts rather than that given by the eyewitness who testified for the plaintiff. After the trial court determined that the plaintiff had not established her theory of a battery (<i>i.e.</i>, that Brian had pulled the chair out from under the plaintiff while she was in the act of sitting down), it then became concerned with whether a battery was established under the facts as it found them to be.</p>
<p id="658d88c5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this connection, we quote another portion of the comment on the “Character of actor’s intention,” relating to clause (a) of the rule from the Restatement heretofore set forth:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="658d88c6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">It is not enough that the act itself is intentionally done and this, even though the actor realizes or should realize that it contains a very grave risk of bringing about the contact or apprehension. Such realization may make the actor’s conduct negligent or even reckless but unless he realizes that to a substantial certainty, the contact or apprehension will result, the actor has not that intention which is necessary to make him liable under the rule stated in this Section.</p></div>
<span title="22" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-22">p. 22</span>
<p id="658dafd7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A battery would be established if, in addition to plaintiff’s fall, it was proved that, when Brian moved the chair, he knew with substantial certainty that the plaintiff would attempt to sit down where the chair had been. If Brian had any of the intents which the trial court found, in the italicized portions of the findings of fact quoted above, that he did not have, he would of course have had the knowledge to which we have referred. The mere absence of any intent to injure the plaintiff or to play a prank on her or to embarrass her, or to commit an assault and battery on her would not absolve him from liability if in fact he had such knowledge. <i>Mercer v. Corbin</i> (1889), 117 Ind. 450, 20 N.E. 132, 3 L. R.A. 221. Without such knowledge, there would be nothing wrongful about Brian’s act in moving the chair, and, there being no wrongful act, there would be no liability.</p>
<p id="658dafd8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While a finding that Brian had no such knowledge can be inferred from the findings made, we believe that before the plaintiff’s action in such a case should be dismissed there should be no question but that the trial court had passed upon that issue; hence, the case should be remanded for clarification of the findings to specifically cover the question of Brian’s knowledge, because intent could be inferred therefrom. If the court finds that he had such knowledge, the necessary intent will be established and the plaintiff will be entitled to recover, even though there was no purpose to injure or embarrass the plaintiff. <i>Vosburg v.

<p id="658dafdb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Courts routinely hold that children can be liable for torts that they commit. More often than not, however, a child does not possess his own funds to pay a tort judgment. A homeowner’s insurance policy can sometimes be required to pay, at least for accidental torts. Beyond this, parents under some circumstances, and in some states, can also be held accountable for the torts of their children. Often this is not automatic but might be triggered by the child acting in a willful or wanton manner. In any event, for now do not assume that parents are automatically liable for all tortious misbehavior by their children.</p>

The defendant, also a minor, was somewhat older than Maurice [the court inferred he was one or two years older].

<p id="658e2520-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Maurice and his mother now seek recovery in this action solely on the theory that the minor defendant was negligent. The judge instructed the jury, in terms that are not challenged on appeal, that the plaintiffs could recover only if the defendant’s act was not intentional or purposeful and was negligent. The jury found for the plaintiffs, and judgment was entered accordingly. The trial judge then allowed the defendant’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the ground that the evidence showed intentional and not negligent conduct.

Harper, F. James, Jr., &amp; O.S. Gray, Torts §3.3, at 272-273 (2d ed. 1986) (“to constitute a battery, the actor must have intended to bring about a harmful or offensive contact.

The defendant may not have understood the seriousness of his conduct and all the harm that might result from it. These facts are not significant, however, in determining whether the defendant committed a battery. <i>See Horton v. Reaves,</i> 186 Colo. 149, 155 (1974) (“the extent of the resulting harm need not be intended, nor even foreseen”).

That theory may or may not prevail. In this case, the plaintiff chose to pursue a theory of an accidental tort, a negligence claim. The court inferred elsewhere in the opinion that this was due to the fact that the defendant had an insurance policy that provided for coverage for accidents but not for intentional torts. Plaintiff’s strategy was based upon the pragmatic consideration that the defendant might not have sufficient assets to recover against other than a potentially applicable insurance policy. The court rejected the attempt to apply the theory of negligence because the court found that the defendant had, as a matter of law, committed an intentional tort instead.</p>

There are some instances where a contact might be characterized as either harmful or offensive and the plaintiff’s counsel might have strategic reasons to characterize it as one or the other. Finally, case law has also developed around instances where the contact involved was somewhat intangible or indirect, yet still harmful or offensive. Consider the nature of each of the types of contacts in the following three cases and whether it makes sense to hold the defendant liable for battery in each instance.</p>

<p id="658ee88b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is a suit for actual and exemplary damages growing out of an alleged…battery. The plaintiff Fisher was a mathematician with the Data Processing Division of the Manned Spacecraft Center, an agency of the National Aeronautics and Space Agency, commonly called NASA, near Houston. The defendants were the Carrousel Motor Hotel, Inc., located in Houston, the Brass Ring Club, which is located in the Carrousel, and Robert W. Flynn, who as an employee of the Carrousel was the manager of the Brass Ring Club. Flynn died before the trial, and the suit proceeded as to the Carrousel and the Brass Ring. Trial was to a jury which found for the plaintiff Fisher. The trial court rendered judgment for the defendants notwithstanding the verdict. The Court of Civil Appeals affirmed. The question before this Court [is] whether there was evidence that an actionable battery was committed.</p>
<p id="658ee88c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff Fisher had been invited by Ampex Corporation and Defense Electronics to a one day’s meeting regarding telemetry equipment at the Carrousel. The invitation included a luncheon. The guests were asked to reply by telephone whether they could attend the luncheon, and Fisher called in his acceptance. After the morning session, the group of 25 or 30 guests adjourned to the Brass Ring Club for lunch. The luncheon was buffet style, and Fisher stood in line with others and just ahead of a graduate student of Rice University who testified at the trial. As Fisher was about to be served, he was approached by Flynn, who snatched the plate from Fisher’s hand and shouted that he, a Negro, could not be served in the club. Fisher testified that he was not actually touched, and did not testify that he suffered fear or apprehension of physical injury; but <span title="27" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-27">p. 27</span>he did testify that he was highly embarrassed and hurt by Flynn’s conduct in the presence of his associates.</p>
<p id="658ee88d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The jury found that Flynn “forcibly dispossessed plaintiff of his dinner plate” and “shouted in a loud and offensive manner” that Fisher could not be served there, thus subjecting Fisher to humiliation and indignity. It was stipulated that Flynn was an employee of the Carrousel Hotel and, as such, managed the Brass Ring Club. The jury also found that Flynn acted maliciously and awarded Fisher $400 actual damages for his humiliation and indignity and $500 exemplary damages for Flynn’s malicious conduct.</p>
<p id="658ee88e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Civil Appeals held that there was no [battery] because there was no physical contact. However, it has long been settled…that actual physical contact is not necessary to constitute a battery, so long as there is contact with clothing or an object closely identified with the body. 1 Harper &amp; James, The Law of Torts 216 (1956); <i>Restatement of Torts 2d, §§18</i> and <i>19</i>. In Prosser, Law of Torts 32 (3d Ed. 1964), it is said:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="658f0f9f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">The interest in freedom from intentional and unpermitted contacts with the plaintiff’s person is protected by an action for the tort commonly called battery. The protection extends to any part of the body, or to anything which is attached to it and practically identified with it. Thus contact with the plaintiff’s clothing, or with a cane, a paper, or any other object held in his hand will be sufficient.…The plaintiff’s interest in the integrity of his person includes all those things which are in contact or connected with it.</p></div>
<p id="658f0fa0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the facts of this case, we have no difficulty in holding that the intentional grabbing of plaintiff’s plate constituted a battery. The intentional snatching of an object from one’s hand is as clearly an offensive invasion of his person as would be an actual contact with the body. “To constitute an assault and battery, it is not necessary to touch the plaintiff’s body or even his clothing; knocking or snatching anything from plaintiff’s hand or touching anything connected with his person, when done in an offensive manner, is sufficient.” <i>Morgan v. Loyacomo,</i> 1 So. 2d 510 (Miss. 1941).</p>
<p id="658f0fa1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Such holding is not unique to the jurisprudence of this State. In <i>S.H. Kress &amp; Co. v. Brashier,</i> 50 S.W.2d 922 (Tex. Civ. App. 1932, no writ), the defendant was held to have committed “an assault and trespass upon the person” by snatching a book from the plaintiff’s hand. The jury findings in that case were that the defendant “dispossessed plaintiff of the book” and caused her to suffer “humiliation and indignity.”</p>
<p id="658f0fa2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rationale for holding an offensive contact with such an object to be a battery is explained in 1 Restatement of Torts 2d §18 (Comment p. 31) as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="658f0fa3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Since the essence of the plaintiff’s grievance consists in the offense to the dignity involved in the unpermitted and intentional invasion of the inviolability of his person and not in any physical harm done to his body, it is not necessary that <span title="28" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-28">p. 28</span>the plaintiff’s actual body be disturbed. Unpermitted and intentional contacts with anything so connected with the body as to be customarily regarded as part of the other’s person and therefore as partaking of its inviolability is actionable as an offensive contact with his person. There are some things such as clothing or a cane or, indeed, anything directly grasped by the hand which are so intimately connected with one’s body as to be universally regarded as part of the person.</p></div>
<p id="658f0fa4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We hold, therefore, that the forceful dispossession of plaintiff Fisher’s plate in an offensive manner was sufficient to constitute a battery, and the trial court erred in granting judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the issue of actual damages.</p>
<p id="658f0fa5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Damages for mental suffering are recoverable without the necessity for showing actual physical injury in a case of willful battery because the basis of that action is the unpermitted and intentional invasion of the plaintiff’s person and not the actual harm done to the plaintiff’s body. Restatement of Torts 2d §18. Personal indignity is the essence of an action for battery; and consequently the defendant is liable not only for contacts which do actual physical harm, but also for those which are offensive and insulting. Prosser, supra; <i>Wilson v. Orr,</i> 97 So. 133 (Ala. 1923). We hold, therefore, that plaintiff was entitled to actual damages for mental suffering due to the willful battery, even in the absence of any physical injury.</p>

<p id="658f36bd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Plaintiff Bonnie Richardson filed suit against her former employer and a co-worker alleging battery. The co-worker, J.R. Hennly, Jr., was successful in obtaining a summary judgment in the trial court. Plaintiff appeals from that order.]</p>
<p id="658f5dce-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The record reveals that Richardson had been working as a receptionist at First Federal for a number of years when Hennly, an administrative officer, began working at her branch. Richardson’s work station was in the lobby of First Federal, and Hennly worked in an office approximately 30 feet from her desk. Hennly had been a pipe smoker for a number of years, and continued to smoke his pipe at work. Richardson immediately began to have difficulty with Hennly’s pipe smoke, to which she apparently had an allergic reaction that caused nausea, stomach pain, loss of appetite, loss of weight, headaches, and <span title="29" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-29">p. 29</span>anxiety. She discussed this problem with her superiors, and several air cleaners were purchased, which were placed in the interior of Hennly’s office and adjacent to his door. For a time Hennly switched to cigarettes, which did not bother Richardson as much, but he resumed smoking his pipe, stating that he wished to avoid becoming addicted to cigarettes. Richardson was twice hospitalized because of her adverse reactions. Shortly after Richardson returned to work from her second hospitalization her employment was terminated, primarily for excessive absenteeism.</p>
<p id="658f5dcf-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In opposition to the motion for summary judgment Richardson presented medical evidence attributing her adverse reactions to the pipe smoke. This evidence was not rebutted. It is uncontroverted that Hennly was aware of Richardson’s adverse reactions to his pipe smoke and that she was twice hospitalized. The evidence is in conflict regarding whether Hennly ever smoked anywhere at work other than in his office; whether he intentionally smoked around Richardson to annoy her; and whether he made teasing or offensive remarks regarding his smoking.</p>
<p id="658f5dd0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hennly moved for summary judgment as to Richardson’s claim of battery on the ground that pipe smoke is an immaterial substance incapable of battering another. Richardson maintains the trial court erred by granting partial summary judgment to Hennly on this claim.</p>
<p id="658f5dd1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our courts have recognized an interest in the inviolability of one’s person and, along with most other jurisdictions have followed the common law rule that any unlawful touching is actionable as a battery. <i>Haile v. Pittman</i>, 389 S.E.2d 564 (Ga. 1989<i>)</i>. Such a cause of action will lie even in the absence of direct physical contact between the actor and the injured party: “‘The unlawful touching need not be direct, but may be indirect, as by the precipitation upon the body of a person of any material substance.’” <i>Hendricks v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp;c. Co.,</i> 387 S.E.2d 593 (Ga. 1989).</p>
<p id="658f5dd2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We note that Richardson has not alleged that <i>any</i> or <i>all</i> smoke with which she came into contact would constitute battery. Instead, she has alleged that Hennly, knowing it would cause her to suffer an injurious reaction, intentionally and deliberately directed his pipe smoke at her <i>in order</i> to injure her or with conscious disregard of the knowledge that it would do so. We decline to hold that this allegation must fail as a matter of law. We are not prepared to accept Hennly’s argument that pipe smoke is a substance so immaterial that it is incapable of being used to batter indirectly. Pipe smoke is visible; it is detectable through the senses and may be ingested or inhaled. It is capable of “touching” or making contact with one’s person in a number of ways. Since no other element of the tort has been conclusively negated, Hennly has not shown as a matter of law that he is entitled to judgment. Moreover, a jury question remains regarding whether Hennly actually directed his pipe smoke at Richardson. We conclude…the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Hennly on the battery claim.</p>

<p id="658f84e9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff-appellant, Ahron Leichtman, appeals from the trial court’s order dismissing his complaint against the defendants-appellees, WLW Jacor Communications (“WLW”), William Cunningham and Andy Furman, for battery.…In his single assignment of error, Leichtman contends that his complaint was sufficient to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and, therefore, the trial court was in error when it granted the defendants’ motion. We agree in part.</p>
<p id="658f84ea-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In his complaint, Leichtman claims to be “a nationally known” antismoking advocate. Leichtman alleges that, on the date of the Great American Smokeout, he was invited to appear on the WLW Bill Cunningham radio talk show to discuss the harmful effects of smoking and breathing secondary smoke. He also alleges that, while he was in the studio, Furman, another WLW talk-show host, lit a cigar and repeatedly blew smoke in Leichtman’s face “for the purpose of causing physical discomfort, humiliation and distress.”</p>
<p id="658f84eb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the rules of notice pleading, Civ. R. 8(A)(1) requires only “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” When construing a complaint for failure to state a claim, under Civ. R. 12(B)(6), the court assumes that the factual allegations on the face of the complaint are true. Because it is so easy for the pleader to satisfy the standard of Civ. R. 8(A), few complaints are subject to dismissal.</p>
<p id="658fabfc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Leichtman contends that Furman’s intentional act constituted a battery. The Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1965), states:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="658fabfd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">An actor is subject to liability to another for battery if:</p>

<p id="658fac01-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In determining if a person is liable for a battery, the Supreme Court has adopted the rule that “[c]ontact which is offensive to a reasonable sense of personal dignity is offensive contact.” <i>Love v. Port Clinton</i> (1988) 524 N.E.2d 166, 167. It has defined “offensive” to mean “disagreeable or nauseating or painful because of outrage to taste and sensibilities or affronting insultingness.” <i>State v. Phipps</i> (1979), 389 N.E.2d 1128, 1131. Furthermore, tobacco smoke, as “particulate matter,” has the physical properties capable of making contact.</p>
<span title="31" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-31">p. 31</span>
<p id="658fac02-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As alleged in Leichtman’s complaint, when Furman intentionally blew cigar smoke in Leichtman’s face, under Ohio common law, he committed a battery. No matter how trivial the incident, a battery is actionable, even if damages are only one dollar. <i>Lacey v. Laird</i> (1956), 139 N.E.2d 25. The rationale is explained by Roscoe Pound in his essay “Liability”: “[I]n civilized society men must be able to assume that others will do them no intentional injury—that others will commit no intentioned aggressions upon them.” Pound, An Introduction to the Philosophy of Law (1922) 169.</p>
<p id="658fac03-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other jurisdictions also have concluded that a person can commit a battery by intentionally directing tobacco smoke at another. <i>Richardson v. Hennly</i> (Ga. App. 1993), 871, 434 S.E.2d 772, 774-775. We do not, however, adopt or lend credence to the theory of a “smoker’s battery,” which imposes liability if there is substantial certainty that exhaled smoke will predictably contact a nonsmoker. Ezra, <i>Smoker Battery: An Antidote to Second-Hand Smoke</i> (1990), 63 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1061, 1090. [W]hether the “substantial certainty” prong of intent from the Restatement of Torts translates to liability for secondary smoke via the intentional tort doctrine in employment cases as defined by the Supreme Court in <i>Fyffe v. Jeno’s, Inc. (Ohio 1991),</i> 570 N.E.2d 1108, need not be decided here because Leichtman’s claim for battery is based exclusively on Furman’s commission of a deliberate act.</p>
<p id="658fd214-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Arguably, trivial cases are responsible for an avalanche of lawsuits in the courts. They delay cases that are important to individuals and corporations and that involve important social issues. The result is justice denied to litigants and their counsel who must wait for their day in court.</p>
<p id="658fd215-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case emphasizes the need for some form of alternative dispute resolution operating totally outside the court system as a means to provide an attentive ear to the parties and a resolution of disputes in a nominal case. Some need a forum in which they can express corrosive contempt for another without dragging their antagonist through the expense inherent in a lawsuit. Until such an alternative forum is created, Leichtman’s battery claim, previously knocked out by the trial judge in the first round, now survives round two to advance again through the courts into round three.</p>

<p id="658fd219-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Harmful vs. Offensive Contacts Defined.</i></b> The cases in the preceding section involved harmful or offensive contacts. Harmful contacts are defined by the Restatement as “any physical impairment of the condition of another’s body, or physical pain or illness.” Restatement (Second) of Torts §16. This is a fairly easy test for evaluating whether the resulting contact qualifies for a battery. Except in cases where the only claimed harm is the plaintiff’s experience of pain, most harmful contacts are confirmed through objective evidence of the <span title="32" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-32">p. 32</span>harm—the bruised knee, the cut on the arm, the black eye, the missing limb, the burnt skin, or the gunshot wound. The test for an offensive contact is easily stated but tends to cause a bit more controversy in terms of its application. The test is considered to be objective rather than subjective, because it is generally insufficient if the only person to consider the contact offensive is the plaintiff. The Restatement indicates a contact is offensive only if it “offends a reasonable sense of dignity.” The comments add that:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="658ff92a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">In order that a contact be offensive to a reasonable sense of personal dignity, it must be one which would offend the ordinary person and as such one not unduly sensitive as to his personal dignity. It must, therefore, be a contact which is unwarranted by the social usages prevalent at the time and place at which it is inflicted.</p></div>
<p id="658ff92b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Restatement (Second) of Torts §19, cmt. a (1965). Under these standards, would the contact involved in the preceding cases meet the test for a harmful or offensive contact, or both? As the courts have held, a battery can also be established by proof that the contact was offensive rather than harmful. Further, the <i>Fisher</i> court held that a battery was possible even with no actual physical contact with the plaintiff so long as contact occurred with an object closely associated and connected with the plaintiff. Can you imagine any contacts that might constitute both harmful and offensive contacts?</p>
<p id="658ff92c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Indirect and Intangible Contacts.</i></b> Deciding that smoke has physical properties and is capable of touching someone, the courts in <i>Hennley</i> and <i>Leichtman</i> permitted potential recoveries. Is there any risk of recognizing such intangible contacts as sufficient to impose battery liability? What about breathing on another person? While imposing liability for blowing smoke may seem a fair result in one case, do you recognize how expanding the tort in this manner creates uncertainty in terms of the potential application to other intangible contacts? Is this uncertainty and lack of predictability an acceptable price to pay for reaching what seems to be a fair result in one case?</p>

A slightly more difficult question is whether liability for a battery will result when the <i>nature</i> of the contact intended is <i>qualitatively</i> different from that which actually occurs as a consequence of the defendant’s action. In such an instance, does it even make sense to consider application of an intentional tort theory rather than an accidental tort such as negligence? The following case tackles this problem.</p>

Charles A. Nelson, the plaintiff in this case…asserts that the trial court should have held Albert Carroll…liable for the tort of battery as a matter of law, sending to the jury only the issue of damages. We agree with Nelson that a claim of “accident” provides no defense to a battery claim where the evidence is undisputed that Nelson was shot by Carroll as Carroll threatened and struck him on the side of his head with the handgun.</p>

The shooting occurred on the evening of July 25, 1992, in a private nightclub in Baltimore City that Nelson was patronizing. Carroll, who was described as being a ‘little tipsy,’ entered the club and demanded repayment by Nelson of the $3,800 balance of an $8,000 loan that Carroll had made to Nelson. Nelson immediately offered to make a payment on account but that was unsatisfactory to Carroll. At some point Carroll produced a handgun from his jacket.</p>

<p id="659131dc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nelson testified to undergoing extensive medical treatment resulting from his gunshot wound. Immediately after being shot, Nelson lost consciousness as a result of blood loss and did not fully regain consciousness for three or four months, until November 1992. He continued to spend months in various hospitals and rehabilitation facilities, undergoing multiple operations. He testified to the nearly complete loss of his eyesight.</p>
<p id="659131dd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nelson’s sole contention before this Court is that he was entitled to a motion for judgment on the issue of liability for battery. He contends that the evidence that Carroll committed a battery is uncontested. Specifically, Nelson asserts that Carroll’s primary defense on the issue of liability—that the discharge of the handgun was accidental—is unavailable under the circumstances of this case.</p>
<p id="659158ee-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Preliminarily, it should be emphasized that the only defense raised by Carroll as to liability was that the actual shooting of the handgun was accidental. No evidence was produced to contest the other evidence relating to the course of events leading to the shooting. Carroll does not dispute the testimony that he was at the nightclub the night Nelson was shot, that he openly carried the handgun and confronted Nelson about a debt owed him, and that, out of anger, he struck Nelson with the handgun on the side of Nelson’s head at least once. Nor did Carroll present any evidence that would conflict with the testimony that Carroll was responsible for firing the shot that struck Nelson. The only point made in Carroll’s defense (and which apparently the jury believed) was that the actual gunshot occurred accidentally. Carroll’s counsel specifically conceded in his closing argument that Carroll “shouldn’t have gone in there with a gun. He was wrong. But what he intended to do was to scare him.”</p>
<p id="659158ef-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since the only disputed fact relates to whether Carroll shot Nelson accidentally as he was striking him, we need only address the narrow question of whether, under the facts of this case, the defense that the shot was fired accidentally is capable of exonerating Carroll of liability.</p>

<p id="659158f2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">In torts, the word “intent” means that the actor in question had either the subjective</p>

</div>
<p id="659158f5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A battery occurs when one intends a harmful or offensive contact with another without that person’s consent. <i>See</i> Restatement (Second) of Torts §13 &amp; cmt. <i>d</i> (1965). “The act in question must be some positive or affirmative action on the part of the defendant.” <i>Saba v. Darling,</i> 575 A.2d 1240, 1242 (Md. 1990). <i>See also</i> Prosser &amp; Keeton, The Law of Torts §9, at 39 (5th ed. 1984). A battery may occur through a defendant’s direct or indirect contact with the plaintiff. In this case, Carroll unquestionably committed a battery when he struck Nelson on the side of his head with his handgun. Likewise, an indirect contact, such as occurs when a bullet strikes a victim, may constitute a battery. “It is enough that the defendant sets <span title="36" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-36">p. 36</span>a force in motion which ultimately produces the result.…” Prosser &amp; Keeton, The Law of Torts §9, at 40 (5th ed. 1984). Thus, if we assume the element of intent was present, Carroll also committed a battery when he discharged his handgun, striking Nelson with a bullet.</p>
<p id="65918006-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nelson’s action in the instant case focuses on the indirect contact of the bullet and not the battery that occurred when Carroll struck him on the head. It is the bullet that allegedly caused the harm for which Nelson seeks damages. As the analysis that follows suggests, however, the circumstances surrounding the gunshot are relevant in determining whether a battery occurred.</p>
<p id="65918007-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Carroll’s defense that he accidentally discharged the handgun requires us to examine the “intent” requirement for the tort of battery. It is universally understood that some form of intent is required for battery. <i>See</i> Restatement (Second) of Torts §13 (1965) (“An actor is subject to liability to another for battery if…he acts <i>intending</i> to cause a harmful or offensive contact.…” (Emphasis added)); Prosser &amp; Keeton, The Law of Torts §9, at 39 (5th ed. 1984) (Battery requires “an act <i>intended</i> to cause the plaintiff…to suffer such a contact.…” (Emphasis added)); Harper, James &amp; Gray, The Law of Torts §3.3, at 3:9 (3d ed. 1996) (“To constitute a battery, the actor must have <i>intended</i> to bring about a harmful or offensive contact or to put the other party in apprehension thereof.” (Emphasis added) (footnote omitted)). It is also clear, however, that the intent required is not a specific intent to cause the type of harm that occurred:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65918008-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">The defendant’s liability for the resulting harm extends, as in most other cases of intentional torts, to consequences which the defendant did not intend, and could not reasonably have foreseen, upon the obvious basis that it is better for unexpected losses to fall upon the intentional wrongdoer than upon the innocent victim.</p></div>
<p id="65918009-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Prosser &amp; Keeton, The Law of Torts §9, at 40 (5th ed. 1984).</p>
<p id="6591800a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, a purely accidental touching, or one caused by mere inadvertence, is not enough to establish the intent requirement for battery. <i>See, e.g., Steinman v. Laundry Co.,</i> 71 A. 517, 518 (Md. 1908) (finding a lack of intent for battery where “there [was] no pretense here that this contact of his knee with hers was wilful, angry or insolent, <i>and the only inference from her testimony is that it was purely accidental</i>, as in the case of one stumbling, and, in his fall coming in contact with the person of another.” (Emphasis added).</p>
<p id="6591a71b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The intent element of battery requires not a specific desire to bring about a certain result, but rather a general intent to unlawfully invade another’s physical well being through a harmful or offensive contact or an apprehension of such a contact.</p>
<p id="6591a71c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, innocent conduct that accidentally or inadvertently results in a harmful or offensive contact with another will not give rise to liability, but one will be liable for such contact if it comes about as a result of the actor’s volitional conduct where there is an intent to invade the other person’s legally protected interests.</p>
<p id="6591a71d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The only reasonable inference that can be drawn from the circumstances of this shooting, which in essence are uncontested, is that Carroll’s actions <span title="37" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-37">p. 37</span>evidenced an intent to commit a battery. Carroll presented no evidence disputing the fact that he carried a loaded handgun and that he struck Nelson on the head with the gun. The merely speculative evidence upon which Carroll claims the shot was an accident was Dukes’ testimony that when Carroll “went to hit him again…the gun went off.” In contrast, the evidence is undisputed that Carroll possessed a handgun which he openly carried into the nightclub, that Carroll struck Nelson with the handgun, and that the handgun discharged simultaneously as Carroll went to strike Nelson again. Indeed, taking every possible inference in favor of Carroll, the gunshot occurred as he attempted to strike Nelson with the gun. Under such circumstances, no reasonable inference can be drawn that Carroll lacked the required intent to commit the battery.</p>
<p id="6591a71e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The law imposes upon Carroll the responsibility for losses associated with his wrongful actions. It is of no import that he may not have intended to actually shoot Nelson since the uncontested facts demonstrate that he did intend to invade Nelson’s legally protected interests in not being physically harmed or assaulted. He violated those interests by committing an assault and battery when he threatened Nelson with the handgun and struck Nelson on the head. Even assuming as we must that Carroll did not intend to inflict the particular damages arising from the gunshot wound, it is more appropriate that those losses fall to Carroll as the wrongdoer than to Nelson as the innocent victim. Therefore, the motion for judgment as to liability should have been granted, with the only question remaining for the jury being the damages resulting from the discharge of the gun.</p>

How can these observations be reconciled?</p>
<p id="6591ce32-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Liability for Unforeseen Results.</i></b> To a certain extent the holding in this case is consistent with the holding in the <i>Blackshear</i> case involving the firecracker. If you represented the plaintiff in this case, how would you use the holding from <i>Blackshear</i> to argue for full liability here? If you represented the defendant in the <i>Nelson</i> case, how would you try to distinguish the <i>Blackshear</i> holding from this one? Lawyers make a living making such arguments, and recognizing when a new case presents an extension of prior law is a valuable skill to possess.</p>
<p id="6591ce33-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Proximate Cause Not Applicable.</i></b> One of the traditional tests for proximate cause is a test of foreseeability—that one is only liable for harm that was reasonably foreseeable at the time of the defendant’s misconduct. Chapter 5 <span title="38" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-38">p. 38</span>will discuss this, and other, tests for proximate or “legal” causation in detail. The defendant in <i>Nelson</i> was, in effect, arguing for application of these proximate cause principles to the battery claim. However, proximate cause is historically not applied to intentional torts, at least not in the same manner as it is with claims for negligence. The court appropriately rejected this argument. The important concept is to remember when tort doctrines apply, and when they do not apply. We will explore proximate cause in some detail in the chapter on negligence. The Third Restatement reaffirms this principle of holding intentional tortfeasors liable for even unanticipated harms caused by their misconduct, stating that “An actor who intentionally…causes harm is subject to liability for a broader range of harms than the harms for which that actor would be liable if only acting negligently.” Restatement (Third ) of Torts §33(b). Illustration 2 to §33(b) provides an example of such broad liability:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">

The homemade bomb was placed there by Dick and Anna with the intent that it explode and harm those in the vicinity. A year after he was injured by the bomb, Mike committed suicide. Damages for Mike’s death may be found by the factfinder to be within the scope of Dick’s and Anna’s liability for their intentional conduct. However, before Dick and Anna may be found liable for Mike’s death, the factfinder must determine that the injury from the bomb was a factual cause of Mike’s suicide.</p></div>

Notwithstanding these express rejections of such proximate cause limitations on liability for intentional torts, one can find some authorities that suggest that in some instances, a consequence of willful misconduct might be too far removed to create liability for the intentional tortfeasor. <i>See e.g.,</i> Thompson v. Hodges<i>,</i> 237 S.W.2d 757, 759 (Tex. Civ. App.—San Antonio, 1951) (“The law will presume that a person willfully assaulting another intends the direct and immediate consequences of his acts.”); C.J.S., Damages §25b (“In the case of willful torts the wrongdoer is responsible for the direct and immediate consequences regardless of whether they might have been contemplated, foreseen, or expected.”).</p>

But is it sufficient if the defendant intended to cause a non-harmful contact that turns out to be harmful? There is a whole category of cases involving benign hugs or other contacts where the defendant intends something like a harmless pat on the back of the plaintiff. But so long as the pat on the back is not consented to by the plaintiff, should the defendant be liable for any unforeseen ill effects of the touching?

We disagree with the court of appeals. Rather, we conclude that under the facts present in this case, in order to recover on a theory of intentional tort, the plaintiff, Sherry Lynn Muniz, was required to prove that Everly intended to commit an act and that Everly intended the act to result in a harmful or offensive contact.</p>
<p id="65921c64-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In October of 1993, Barbara White placed her eighty-three-year-old grandmother, Helen Everly, in an assisted living facility, the Beatrice Hover Personal Care Center. Within a few days of admission, Everly started exhibiting erratic behavior. She became agitated easily, and occasionally acted aggressively toward others.</p>
<p id="65921c65-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On November 21, 1993, the caregiver in charge of Everly’s wing asked [plaintiff] Sherry Lynn Muniz, a shift supervisor at Hover, to change Everly’s adult diaper. The caregiver informed Muniz that Everly was not cooperating in that effort. This did not surprise Muniz because she knew that Everly sometimes acted obstinately. Indeed, initially Everly refused to allow Muniz to change her diaper, but eventually Muniz thought that Everly relented. However, as Muniz reached toward the diaper, Everly struck Muniz on the jaw and ordered her out of the room.</p>
<p id="65921c66-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The next day, Dr. Haven Howell, M.D. examined Everly at Longmont United Hospital.

[The trial court dismissed the negligence claims before trial.] The case proceeded to a jury trial on March 17, 1997. While arguing outside the presence of the jury for specific jury instructions, the parties took differing positions on the mental state required to commit the alleged intentional torts. Muniz requested the following instruction: “A person who has been found incompetent may intend to do an act even if he or she lacked control of reason and acted unreasonably.” White tendered a different instruction:</p>

<p id="65926a91-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Muniz’s counsel objected to the last sentence of the instruction, claiming that it misstated the law. He argued that the instruction improperly broadened the holding in <i>Horton v. Reaves,</i> 526 P.2d 304 (Colo. 1974), where the supreme court held that an infant must appreciate the offensiveness or wrongfulness of her conduct to be liable for an intentional tort.

<p id="659291a2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court of appeals reversed the decision of the trial court and remanded the case for a new trial. The court of appeals reasoned that most states continue to hold mentally deficient plaintiffs liable for their intentional acts regardless of their ability to understand the offensiveness of their actions. The court of appeals reasoned that insanity may not be asserted as a defense to an intentional tort, and thus, concluded that the trial court erred in “instructing the jury that Everly must have appreciated the offensiveness of her conduct.” Id. at 26.</p>
<p id="659291a3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question we here address is whether an intentional tort requires some proof that the tortfeasor not only intended to contact another person, but also intended that the contact be harmful or offensive to the other person.</p>
<p id="659291a4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Historically, the intentional tort of battery required a subjective desire on the part of the tortfeasor to inflict a harmful or offensive contact on another. Thus, it was not enough that a person intentionally contacted another <i>resulting</i> in a harmful or offensive contact. Instead, the actor had to understand that his contact would be harmful or offensive. <i>See</i> Keeton, <i>supra</i>, §8; Dobbs, <i>supra</i>, §29. The actor need not have intended, however, the harm that actually resulted from his action. Thus, if a slight punch to the victim resulted in traumatic injuries, the actor would be liable for all the damages resulting from the battery even if he only intended to knock the wind out of the victim.</p>
<p id="659291a5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Juries may find it difficult to determine the mental state of an actor, but they may rely on circumstantial evidence in reaching their conclusion. No person can pinpoint the thoughts in the mind of another, but a jury can examine the facts to conclude what another must have been thinking. For example, a person of reasonable intelligence knows with substantial certainty that a stone thrown into a crowd will strike someone and result in an offensive or harmful contact to that person. Hence, if an actor of average intelligence performs such an act, the jury can determine that the actor had the requisite intent to cause a harmful or offensive contact, even though the actor denies having such thoughts.</p>
<p id="659291a6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More recently, some courts around the nation have abandoned this dual intent requirement in an intentional tort setting, that being an intent to contact and an intent that the contact be harmful or offensive, and have required only that the tortfeasor intend a contact with another that <i>results</i> in a harmful or offensive touching. <i>See Brzoska v. Olson,</i> 668 A.2d 1355, 1360 (Del. 1995<i>)</i> (stating that battery is an intentional, unpermitted contact on another which is harmful or offensive; and that the intent necessary for battery is the intent to contact the person); <i>White v. University of Idaho,</i> 797 P.2d 108, 111 (Idaho 1990) (determining that battery requires an intent to cause an unpermitted contact, not an intent to make a harmful or offensive contact). Under this view, a victim need only prove that a voluntary movement by the tortfeasor resulted in a contact which a reasonable person would find offensive [and] to which the victim did not consent. <i>See University of Idaho,</i> 797 P.2d at 111. These courts would find intent in contact to the back of a friend that results in a severe, unexpected injury even though the actor did not intend the contact to be harmful or offensive. The actor thus could be held liable for battery because a reasonable person would find an injury offensive or harmful, irrespective of the intent of the actor to harm or offend.</p>
<span title="42" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-42">p. 42</span>
<p id="6592b8b7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts occasionally have intertwined these two distinct understandings of the requisite intent. <i>See Brzoska,</i> 668 A.2d at 1360 (approving the Restatement view of the intent element of a battery, but summarizing the rule as “the intentional, unpermitted contact upon the person of another which <i>is</i> harmful or offensive”) (emphasis added). In most instances when the defendant is a mentally alert adult, this commingling of definitions prejudices neither the plaintiff nor the defendant. However, when evaluating the culpability of particular classes of defendants, such as the very young and the mentally disabled, the intent required by a jurisdiction becomes critical.</p>
<p id="6592b8b8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Horton v. Reaves,</i> 526 P.2d 304 (Colo. 1974), we examined the jury instructions used to determine if a four-year-old boy and a three-year-old boy intentionally battered an infant when they dropped a baby who suffered skull injuries as a result. We held that although a child need not intend the resulting harm, the child must understand that the contact may be harmful in order to be held liable. Our conclusion comported with the Restatement’s definition of intent; it did not state a new special rule for children, but applied the general rule to the context of an intentional tort of battery committed by a child. Because a child made the contact, the jury had to examine the objective evidence to determine if the child actors intended their actions to be offensive or harmful. This result complied with both the Colorado jury instruction at the time, and the definition of battery in the Restatement.</p>
<p id="6592b8b9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, we have the opportunity to examine intent in the context of an injury inflicted by a mentally deficient, Alzheimer’s patient. White seeks an extension of <i>Horton</i> to the mentally ill, and Muniz argues that a mere voluntary movement by Everly can constitute the requisite intent. We find that the law of Colorado requires the jury to conclude that the defendant both intended the contact and intended it to be harmful or offensive.</p>

<p id="6592b8be-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because Colorado law requires a dual intent, we apply here the Restatement’s definition of the term. As a result, we reject the arguments of Muniz and find that the trial court delivered an adequate instruction to the jury.</p>
<p id="6592b8bf-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Operating in accordance with this instruction, the jury had to find that Everly appreciated the offensiveness of her conduct in order to be liable for the intentional tort of battery. It necessarily had to consider her mental capabilities in making such a finding, including her age, infirmity, education, skill, or any other characteristic as to which the jury had evidence. We presume that the jury “looked into the mind of Everly,” and reasoned that Everly did not possess the necessary intent to commit an assault or a battery. <i>See Hall v. Walter,</i> 969 P.2d 224, 238 (Colo. 1998) (stating that the court presumes the jury followed instructions in reaching its verdict).</p>

<p id="6592b8c0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A jury can, of course, find a mentally deficient person liable for an intentional tort, but in order to do so, the jury must find that the actor intended offensive or harmful consequences. As a result, insanity is not a defense to an intentional tort according to the ordinary use of that term, but is a characteristic, like infancy, that may make it more difficult to prove the intent element of battery. Our decision today does not create a special rule for the elderly, but applies Colorado’s intent requirement in the context of a woman suffering the effects of Alzheimer’s.</p>
<p id="6592b8c1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Contrary to Muniz’s arguments, policy reasons do not compel a different result. Injured parties consistently have argued that even if the tortfeasor intended no harm or offense, “where one of two innocent persons must suffer a loss, it should be borne by the one who occasioned it.” Keeton, <i>supra</i>, §135. Our decision may appear to erode that principle. Yet, our decision does not bar future injured persons from seeking compensation. Victims may still bring intentional tort actions against mentally disabled adults, but to prevail, they must prove all the elements of the alleged tort. Furthermore, because the mentally disabled are held to the reasonable person standard in negligence actions, victims may find relief more easily under a negligence cause of action. <i>See Johnson v. Lambotte,</i> 363 P.2d 165, 166 (1961).</p>
<p id="6592b8c2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With regard to the intent element of the intentional torts of assault and battery, we hold that regardless of the characteristics of the alleged tortfeasor, a plaintiff must prove that the actor desired to cause offensive or harmful consequences by his act. The plaintiff need not prove, however, that the actor intended the harm that actually results. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the court of appeals and remand the case to that court for reinstatement of the jury verdict in favor of White and consideration of any remaining issues.</p>

<p id="6592dfd5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>The Implications for the Debate.</i></b> The court in <i>White</i> states that “in most instances when the defendant is a mentally alert adult,” the choice between single and dual intent “prejudices neither the plaintiff nor the defendant.” Is this statement more likely to be accurate when one is analyzing a claim involving a harmful contact or an offensive contact?</p>
<p id="6592dfd6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Friendly Unsolicited Hug Cases.</i></b> If a piano professor walks up behind a student of his playing a piano at a social event and begins to tap on her shoulders, as if to demonstrate the proper technique to use in playing the instrument, and inadvertently hurts the student’s back, will the professor be liable for battery? <i>See</i> White v. University of Idaho, 768 P.2d 827 (Idaho Ct. App. 1989), <i>aff’d</i>, 797 P.2d 108 (Idaho 1990). This case is analogous to the so-called friendly unsolicited hug cases, where one intends a benign, though unconsented, contact with another and causes harm. Do policy reasons support applying an intentional tort theory to such cases or would it make more sense to apply negligence law instead?</p>
<span title="44" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-44">p. 44</span>
<p id="6592dfd7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Irrational Intent.</i></b> Another aspect of the trial court’s instruction that was not challenged in <i>White</i> was the explanation that one could intend a result even if her motives were irrational. This is consistent with case law holding insane people liable for battery where they clearly intended to cause a harmful contact based upon the delusion that the victim was someone else. Polmatier v. Russ, 537 A.2d 468 (Conn. 1988) (holding defendant liable for battery where he shot his father-in-law multiple times based upon the delusion that the victim was a “spy for the red Chinese” sent to assassinate the defendant).</p>
<p id="6592dfd8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Problem: Interpreting a Jury Charge.</i></b> Consider whether the following pattern of jury instruction seems to be describing a dual or single intent standard for battery liability: “A person commits a battery if he intentionally causes bodily injury to another.” It’s not always entirely clear, but the above charge infers that what must be intended is not just contact but bodily injury—dual intent. If a charge leaves the issue open it invites counsel for the parties to argue the case according to their own interpretation. Part of the job of judges in approving and submitting the charge to the jury is to avoid such debates from playing out during closing arguments by drafting instructions that clarify what the jury must find to impose liability.</p>
<p id="6592dfd9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. <i>Criminal Law vs. Civil Law Regarding Insanity.</i></b> The law is fairly settled that in a civil tort suit, the defendant’s status as insane is not a per se defense to a tort claim. So long as the defendant’s mental status makes it possible for the elements of the cause of action to be satisfied, the defendant can remain fully liable for damages in tort. In criminal law, the opposite is often the case with legal insanity being a defense to many crimes.</p>

<p id="6592dfdc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Battery is designed to protect one’s bodily integrity. Specifically, it provides redress for intentional invasions of one’s bodily integrity that take the form of harmful or offensive contacts. Whether the contact is harmful or offensive is judged according to objective standards. Instances of harmful contact are usually obvious—cuts, bruises, broken bones, painful touching, or worse. Offensive contact requires not only that the plaintiff consider the touching distasteful, but also that a reasonable person under the circumstances would similarly find the contact distasteful. Every state requires that the defendant at least intended to bring about the physical contact. Accidental bumping, no matter how disastrous the consequences, is not a battery. Some states require also that the defendant must have intended for the contact to be harmful or appreciate that it would be considered offensive—the dual intent jurisdictions. But no jurisdiction requires that the defendant must have intended (or foreseen) all of the resulting harm that actually occurs. So long as the defendant intended any harm she is liable for all the harm that results.</p>

An assault can occur without a battery and vice versa. But often a tortfeasor’s conduct will be actionable as both an assault and a battery. Unlike the interest in bodily integrity that is protected by a battery cause of action, the tort of assault is designed to protect the plaintiff’s mind—specifically to provide redress for the defendant having created in the mind of the plaintiff an apprehension of an impending battery. Whether or not a battery occurs is of no consequence. If the apprehension occurs the defendant may be liable for assault in addition or in lieu of a battery cause of action.</p>

<p id="65932e0c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Plaintiff] Dan R. Cullison petitions this Court to…reverse the trial court’s entry of summary judgment against him and in favor of the [defendants] (collectively “the Medleys”). The Court of Appeals affirmed the entry of summary judgment. For the reasons set forth below, we…reverse the entry of summary judgment and remand to the trial court.</p>
<p id="65932e0d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to Cullison’s deposition testimony, on February 2, 1986, he encountered Sandy, the 16-year-old daughter of Ernest, in a Linton, Indiana, grocery store parking lot. They exchanged pleasantries and Cullison invited her to have a Coke with him and to come to his home to talk further. A few hours later, someone knocked on the door of his mobile home. Cullison got out of bed and answered the door. He testified that he saw a person standing in the darkness who said that she wanted to talk to him. Cullison answered that he would have to get dressed because he had been in bed. Cullison went back to his bedroom, dressed, and returned to the darkened living room of his trailer. When he entered the living room and turned the lights on, he was confronted by Sandy Medley, as well as by father Ernest, brother Ron, mother Doris, and brother-in-law Terry Simmons. Ernest was on crutches due to knee surgery and had a revolver in a holster strapped to his thigh. Cullison testified that Sandy called him a “pervert” and told him he was “sick,” mother Doris berated him while <span title="46" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-46">p. 46</span>keeping her hand in her pocket, convincing Cullison that she also was carrying a pistol. Ron and Terry said nothing to Cullison, but their presence in his trailer home further intimidated him. Primarily, however, Cullison’s attention was riveted to the gun carried by Ernest. Cullison testified that, while Ernest never withdrew the gun from his holster, he “grabbed for the gun a few times and shook the gun” at plaintiff while threatening to “jump astraddle” of Cullison if he did not leave Sandy alone. Cullison testified that Ernest “kept grabbing at it with his hand, like he was going to take it out,” and “took it to mean he was going to shoot me” when Ernest threatened to “jump astraddle” of Cullison. Although no one actually touched Cullison, his testimony was that he feared he was about to be shot throughout the episode because Ernest kept moving his hand toward the gun as if to draw the revolver from the holster while threatening Cullison to leave Sandy alone.</p>
<p id="65932e0e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the Medleys were leaving, Cullison suffered chest pains and feared that he was having a heart attack. Approximately two months later, Cullison testified that Ernest glared at him in a menacing manner while again armed with a handgun at a restaurant in Linton. On one of these occasions, Ernest stood next to the booth where Cullison was seated while wearing a pistol and a holster approximately one foot from Cullison’s face. Shortly after the incident at his home, Cullison learned that Ernest had previously shot a man. This added greatly to his fear and apprehension of Ernest on the later occasions when Ernest glared at him and stood next to the booth at which he was seated while armed with a handgun in a holster.</p>
<p id="65932e0f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Cullison testified that as a result of the incident, he sought psychological counseling and therapy and continued to see a therapist for approximately 18 months. Additionally, Cullison sought psychiatric help and received prescription medication which prevented him from operating power tools or driving an automobile, thus injuring Cullison in his sole proprietorship construction business. Additionally, Cullison testified that he suffered from nervousness, depression, sleeplessness, inability to concentrate and impotency following his run-in with the Medleys.</p>
<p id="65932e10-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In count two of his complaint, Cullison alleged an assault. The Court of Appeals decided that, because Ernest never removed his gun from the holster, his threat that he was going to “jump astraddle” of Cullison constituted conditional language which did not express any present intent to harm Cullison and, therefore, was not an assault. Further, the Court of Appeals decided that even if it were to find an assault, summary judgment was still appropriate because Cullison alleged only emotional distress and made no showing that the Medleys’ actions were malicious, callous, or willful or that the alleged injuries he suffered were a foreseeable result of the Medleys’ conduct. We disagree.</p>
<p id="65932e11-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is axiomatic that assault, unlike battery, is effectuated when one acts intending to cause a harmful or offensive contact with the person of the other or an imminent apprehension of such contact. Restatement (Second) of Torts §21 (1965). It is the right to be free from the apprehension of a battery which is protected by the tort action which we call an assault. As this Court held <span title="47" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-47">p. 47</span>approximately 90 years ago in <i>Kline v. Kline,</i> 64 N.E. 9 (Ind. 1901), an assault constitutes “a touching of the mind, if not of the body.” Because it is a touching of the mind, as opposed to the body, the damages which are recoverable for an assault are damages for mental trauma and distress. “Any act of such a nature as to excite an apprehension of a battery may constitute an assault. It is an assault to shake a fist under another’s nose, to aim or strike at him with a weapon, or to hold it in a threatening position, to rise or advance to strike another, to surround him with a display of force.…” W. Prosser &amp; J. Keaton, Prosser and Keaton on Torts §10 (5th ed. 1984). Additionally, the apprehension must be one which would normally be aroused in the mind of a reasonable person. Id. Finally, the tort is complete with the invasion of the plaintiff’s mental peace.</p>

A jury could reasonably conclude that the Medleys intended to frighten Cullison by surrounding him in his trailer and threatening him with bodily harm while one of them was armed with a revolver, even if that revolver was not removed from the its holster. Cullison testified that Ernest kept grabbing at the pistol as if he were going to take it out, and that Cullison thought Ernest was going to shoot him. It is for the jury to determine whether Cullison’s apprehension of being shot or otherwise injured was one which would normally be aroused in the mind of a reasonable person.

<p id="65935526-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Elements.</i></b> Assault requires the defendant’s voluntary action, coupled with an intent to cause the victim to suffer apprehension of an imminent harmful or offensive contact. As some courts have stated it less formally, an assault occurs when the defendant intends to cause the plaintiff to believe he is about to be battered.</p>
<p id="65935527-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Interest Protected.</i></b> The interest protected by an assault claim is the victim’s peace of mind. The tort provides a remedy for the intentional invasion of the victim’s mind, which occurs when the defendant intentionally causes apprehension of an invasion of the plaintiff’s bodily integrity. It is the touching of the mind, rather than the body, that distinguishes this tort from the related tort of battery. Given this interest, why was the intermediate court of appeals’ reservation regarding the primary harm of the plaintiff misplaced? In terms of a recovery of actual damages, courts recognize the right of the assault victim to recover for the emotional harms caused by the assault, as well as any physical consequences of that emotional disturbance. For example, a plaintiff assaulted <span title="48" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-48">p. 48</span>by a defendant might incur psychiatric expenses, expenses for purchasing pharmaceutical products to contend with the emotional harm, and other medical expenses incurred due to physical ailments brought on by the fright.</p>
<p id="65935528-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Conditional Language.</i></b> The court of appeals had ruled that the mere verbal threat to “jump astraddle” the plaintiff “if he did not leave Sandy alone” could not constitute an assault. There are many assault cases where courts have stated as black letter law that “words alone cannot constitute an assault.” This is misleading because if there are sufficient surrounding circumstances, the defendant’s utterance of certain words might actually meet the elements of assault. Suppose the defendant is holding a gun toward the plaintiff and then says “prepare to die!” Do you see how invoking the mantra “words alone cannot constitute an assault” would not satisfactorily lead to a defense for the defendant in that scenario? Words are always accompanied by some circumstances. The real test is whether, given the totality of the circumstances, including any words spoken by the defendant, the elements of the tort might be satisfied. The answer necessarily varies by the circumstances. Why did the Indiana Supreme Court find that the defendants’ conduct, including the conditional threat, might satisfy the elements of the common law tort of assault? Was it a mere “future threat”?</p>
<p id="65935529-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Problem.</i></b> Despising the plaintiff, and wanting to frighten him, the defendant stands behind the plaintiff and fires a weapon at his head but misses. The plaintiff is deaf and does not find out about the incident until another observer informs him of it. Upon confronting the defendant about the prior incident, the defendant states her plan to shoot the plaintiff the next time she sees him alone. Has an assault occurred?</p>

<p id="65937c44-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para left ">For most courts, it is not enough that the plaintiff actually experiences apprehension of a battery. They also require that the plaintiff’s apprehension be reasonable—that a reasonable person under their circumstances would likewise have experienced such apprehension. Thus both a subjective (the plaintiff’s actual state of mind) and an objective (the hypothetical reasonable person’s supposed state of mind) apprehension must be found before liability for an assault will attach.

<p id="6593a35b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This suit arose from the unfortunate events of Halloween night in 1981. Jeffrey Scott Trammel, aged 15, Robert Martin Landry, Jr., aged 13, and Daniel Breaux, aged 13, went trick-or-treating that evening. About 6:30 p.m., Trammel and Breaux rang Robert Bouton’s (plaintiff) front door bell while Landry waited at the sidewalk. Plaintiff opened the door and saw Breaux standing before him. Breaux was dressed in military fatigues and was holding a plastic model submachine gun. Plaintiff shut the door immediately and locked it, then armed himself with a .357 magnum pistol. He returned to the door, opened it, and saw a flash of light, caused, he alleges, by Trammel’s triggering a photographic flash. Plaintiff’s pistol then discharged, the bullet striking and killing Breaux.</p>
<p id="6593a35c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff brought this suit against Allstate Insurance Company (Allstate), insurer of Landry and Breaux, and Independent Fire Insurance Company (Independent), insurer of Trammel. He alleged that the three boys’ actions were tortious and caused him to be indicted and tried for second-degree murder, incur substantial attorney fees, lose his job, and suffer unfavorable publicity. [Plaintiff was ultimately acquitted in the criminal case. After filing his complaint in this civil case, defendants moved for summary judgment arguing that Plaintiff had no cause of action for assault. The trial court granted their motion.] From that action plaintiff brings this appeal.</p>
<p id="6593ca6d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff claims that the boys committed an assault, causing him to become frightened and triggering the tragic series of events which ensued. Plaintiff must prove an intentional act by the defendants which would have put a person in reasonable apprehension of receiving a battery. <i>See Castiglione v. Galpin,</i> 325 So. 2d 725 (La. App. 4th Cir. 1976); <i>F. Stone, Tort Doctrine</i>, §§159 and 160 in 12 <i>Louisiana Civil Law Treatise</i> 206-207 (1977). We find that the pleadings and evidence fail to establish any right to relief because, under the facts as set out by the plaintiff, he could not have had a <i>reasonable</i> apprehension of an <span title="50" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-50">p. 50</span>impending battery or physical harm. Although it is <i>possible</i> for one who opens his door to trick-or-treaters on Halloween to become so frightened that he believes a battery is imminent, under the circumstances here, such an apprehension is not reasonable. Any reasonable person expects to see an endless array of ghouls, beasts, and characters on this evening, especially when he is, as was plaintiff, passing out candy at his doorstep.</p>

<p id="6593ca70-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">In the context of any tort claim, whenever you see the word “reasonable” used, it alludes to an objective determination based upon the fact finder’s speculation about how a hypothetical, reasonable person would react to something. This reasonable person is discussed in length in Chapter 4 under the topic of Negligence. Even though the reasonable person is primarily a creation of negligence law, it is borrowed in multiple places even for intentional torts.</p>
</div>
<p id="6593ca71-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff contends that “the sole determining issue in this case” is whether we judge the boys’ actions from their point of view or from his. We do neither. Instead, “we place the average reasonable [man] in the very situation which confronted the plaintiff and ask of him oracularly” if an apprehension of a battery could be reasonably expected to follow from such a situation. <i>Stone</i>, at 209, §165. We do not believe that a reasonable person acting reasonably would have been apprehensive of a battery when confronted with this situation on Halloween. Therefore, we hold that plaintiff was not the victim of an assault.</p>
<p id="6593f182-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The court ruled that it need not address the issue of the boys’ intent because the element of reasonable apprehension was lacking.]</p>
<p id="6593f183-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed at plaintiff’s cost.</p>

<p id="6593f186-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Reasonable Apprehension.</i></b> This element of the assault cause of action actually contains two components—the actual (subjective) apprehension of the impending battery by the victim, and the conclusion that this apprehension was reasonable (objective)—that an ordinary person would have likewise experienced such a reaction. Which of the two was lacking according to the court in the <i>Bouton</i> case?</p>
<p id="65941897-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Fear vs. Apprehension.</i></b> While many judicial opinions loosely use the words “fear” and “apprehension” as synonyms, technically an assault only requires the latter and not the former. This might seem to be mere semantics, but it is conceivable for an assault victim to have some apprehension, or appreciation of an impending battery, without actually being frightened by it. Perhaps the victim does not believe the battery will inflict significant harm. Or perhaps the victim feels confident in their ability to defend themselves. Perhaps they are like Jack Bauer from the television show “24” and possess great courage <span title="51" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-51">p. 51</span>and are afraid of no amount of physical pain. Nevertheless, Professor Prosser’s view has been that an assault might still occur without fear: “Apprehension is not the same thing as fear, and the plaintiff is not deprived of his action merely because he is too courageous to be frightened or intimidated.” Prosser, <i>The Law of Torts</i> §10 (5th ed. 1984). By the same token, an assault victim who admits to having no fear of the impending battery will not likely be awarded significant actual damages. While they may possess a claim based upon a technical violation of their rights and have a legal injury, their lack of actual harm will impact the amount of the award the defendant will have to pay. Indeed, their claim might be for nominal damages only—a token amount that signifies a wrongful violation of the plaintiff’s right.</p>

<p id="6594189d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para left ">The final qualification with respect to the elements of assault is that the apprehension must have been of an imminent battery. Courts universally dismiss assault claims based upon threats of a future battery. But just how imminent must the threatened battery be in order to qualify? The following case shows how strictly courts construe this final requirement. Consider the possible reasons for such a strict application of this element.</p>

Because the threatened harm was insufficiently imminent to be actionable as civil assault, we hold the assault claim was appropriately dismissed.</p>
<span title="52" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-52">p. 52</span>
<p id="65943fb5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff, Jordan Brower, is a Seattle resident active in civic affairs. Christopher and Theodore Ackerley, in their early twenties at the time of the alleged telephone calls, are two sons of the founder of Ackerley Communications, Inc., a company engaged in various activities in Seattle including billboard advertising. Brower perceived billboard advertising as a visual blight. Based on his own investigation, he concluded that Ackerley Communications had erected numerous billboards without obtaining permits from the City of Seattle; had not given the City an accurate accounting of its billboards; and was maintaining a number of billboards that were not on the tax rolls. In January, 1991, Brower presented his findings to the City. When the City did not respond, Brower filed suit in October of 1991 against the City and Ackerley Communications seeking enforcement of the City’s billboard regulations.</p>
<p id="65943fb6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Within two days an anonymous male caller began what Brower describes as “a campaign of harassing telephone calls” to Brower’s home that continued over a period of 20 months. The first time, the caller shouted at Brower in an aggressive, meanspirited voice to “get a life” and other words to that effect. Brower received at least one more harassing telephone call by January of 1992.</p>
<p id="65943fb7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the City agreed to pursue Brower’s complaints about the billboard violations, Brower dropped his suit. In April of 1992, the City made a public announcement to the effect that Ackerley Communications had erected dozens of illegal billboards. Within a day of that announcement, Brower received an angry telephone call from a caller he identified as the same caller as the first call. In a loud, menacing voice, the caller told Brower that he should find a better way to spend his time. Two days later there was another call telling Brower to “give it up.”</p>
<p id="659466c8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In July of 1992, shortly after the City Council passed a moratorium on billboard activity, Brower received another angry anonymous call. The male voice swore at him and said, “You think you’re pretty smart, don’t you?” Brower says he seriously wondered whether he was in any danger of physical harm from the caller. Over the following months Brower continued to receive calls from an unidentified male who he says “belittled me, told me what a rotten person I was, and who used offensive profanity.”</p>
<p id="659466c9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On July 19, 1993, the City Council passed a new billboard ordinance. At about 6:30 that evening an angry-voiced man telephoned Brower and said “dick” in a loud voice and hung up. At about 7:30 p.m. the same caller called and said, “I’m going to find out where you live and I’m going to kick your ass.” At 9:43 p.m. Brower received another call from a voice disguised to sound, in Brower’s words, “eerie and sinister.” The caller said “Ooooo, Jordan, oooo, you’re finished; cut you in your sleep, you sack of shit.” Brower recorded the last two calls on his telephone answering machine.</p>
<p id="659466ca-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Brower made a complaint to the police, reporting that he was very frightened by these calls. Because Brower had activated a call trapping feature of his telephone service after the third telephone call, the police were able to learn that the call had originated in the residence of Christopher Ackerley. When contacted by the police, Christopher Ackerley denied making the calls. He said <span title="53" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-53">p. 53</span>Brower’s telephone number was in his apartment, and that his brother Ted Ackerley had been in the apartment at the time and perhaps had made the calls.</p>
<p id="659466cb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The City filed no criminal charges based on the police report. Brower then brought this civil suit against Christopher and Theodore Ackerley seeking compensation for the emotional distress he suffered as the result of the telephone calls. According to Brower, he interpreted the calls of July 19 as a death threat, and felt “hunted down.” He experienced feelings of panic, terror, and insecurity as well as a rising pulse, light-headedness, sweaty palms, sleeplessness, and an inability to concentrate that lasted for some time afterward: “Every day I come home, I worry that someone has burned our house down, or if my wife is late from work, whether she has been harmed.”</p>
<p id="659466cc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The elements of civil assault have not been frequently addressed in Washington cases. The gist of the cause of action is “the victim’s apprehension of imminent physical violence caused by the perpetrator’s action or threat.” In the 1910 case of <i>Howell v. Winters,</i> the Supreme Court relied on a definition provided in Cooley, Torts (3d ed.):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="659466cd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">An assault is an attempt, with unlawful force, to inflict bodily injuries upon another, accompanied with the apparent present ability to give effect to the attempt if not prevented. Such would be the raising of the hand in anger, with an apparent purpose to strike, and sufficiently near to enable the purpose to be carried into effect; the pointing of a loaded pistol at one who is in its range; the pointing of a pistol not loaded at one who is not aware of that fact and making an apparent attempt to shoot; shaking a whip or the fist in a man’s face in anger; riding or running after him in threatening and hostile manner with a club or other weapon; and the like. The right that is invaded here indicates the nature of the wrong. Every person has a right to complete and perfect immunity from hostile assaults that threaten danger to his person; “A right to live in society without being put in fear of personal harm.”</p></div>
<p id="659466ce-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to §31 of the Restatement, words alone are not enough to make an actor liable for assault “unless together with other acts or circumstances they put the other in reasonable apprehension of an imminent harmful or offensive contact with his person.”</p>

<p id="65948de1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Courts frequently say that “words alone cannot constitute an assault,” but then indicate that words, <i>coupled with the right circumstances</i>, might fulfill the elements of this claim. Of course, words are never uttered in a vacuum but in a particular set of circumstances. Interestingly, there are quite a few instances in tort law where the spoken word can become actionable as a tort cause of action. Beyond assault, where spoken threats might be actionable, words harming another’s reputation might be considered defamation; false promises or representations might constitute fraud; intentional infliction of emotional distress might arise from repeated outrageous taunts directed at another; and even bad advice spoken by a lawyer to her client might constitute legal malpractice (a type of negligence).</p>

<p id="65948de2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Ackerleys argue that dismissal of Brower’s assault claim was appropriate because the threatening words were unaccompanied by any physical acts or movements. Brower acknowledges that words alone cannot constitute an assault, but he contends the spoken <span title="54" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-54">p. 54</span>threats became assaultive in view of the surrounding circumstances including the fact that the calls were made to his home, at night, creating the impression that the caller was stalking him.</p>
<p id="65948de3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether the repeated use of a telephone to make anonymous threats constitutes acts or circumstances sufficient to render the threats assaultive is an issue we need not resolve because we find another issue dispositive: the physical harm threatened in the telephone calls to Brower was not imminent.</p>
<p id="65948de4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To constitute civil assault, the threat must be of imminent harm. The Restatement’s comment is to similar effect: “The apprehension created must be one of imminent contact, as distinguished from any contact in the future.” [Restatement (Second) of Torts §29, comment b.] The Restatement gives the following illustration: “<i>A</i> threatens to shoot <i>B</i> and leaves the room with the express purpose of getting his revolver. <i>A</i> is not liable to <i>B</i>.” [Restatement (Second) of Torts §29, comment c, illus. 4.]</p>
<p id="65948de5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The telephone calls received by Brower on July 19 contained two explicit threats: “I’m going to find out where you live and I’m going to kick your ass,” and later, “you’re finished; cut you in your sleep.” The words threatened action in the near future, but not the imminent future. The immediacy of the threats was not greater than in the Restatement’s illustration where <i>A</i> must leave the room to get his revolver. Because the threats, however frightening, were not accompanied by circumstances indicating that the caller was in a position to reach Brower and inflict physical violence “almost at once,” we affirm the dismissal of the assault claim.</p>

<p id="6594b4f8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Imminent Battery.</i></b> The court in <i>Brower</i> uses an illustration from the Restatement to find that the apprehension of the plaintiff was not of an imminent harmful contact, but one too remote to be actionable as assault. This case demonstrates that even a reasonable threat of a possible future battery will not be actionable as assault. Why would courts insist upon an imminent threat in order to provide a remedy? Aren’t there some threats of such harm in the future that would cause an ordinary person to suffer great emotional distress?</p>
<p id="6594b4f9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.</i></b> A tort we will be covering later in this chapter—intentional infliction of emotional distress—was also alleged by the plaintiff in this case. In a separate portion of the opinion, the court held that the plaintiff might be able to recover under that theory.</p>
<p id="6594b4fa-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Highly Sensitive Plaintiff.</i></b> Perhaps the plaintiffs in <i>Bouton</i> and <i>Brower</i> were unusually prone to being easily frightened. If so, under black letter law they would fail the test for having a “reasonable” apprehension of an imminent battery and be denied recovery. But what if a defendant acted on purpose to <span title="55" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-55">p. 55</span>cause such fright, with full knowledge of the plaintiff’s unusual skittishness and with the desire to take advantage of the plaintiff’s unusual sensitivity? Is it fair to deny recovery in such circumstances? If, for example, an associate of the eccentric Howard Hughes made an idle comment about planning to kiss him on the cheek to instill fear and cause Howard Hughes to give him a job promotion, should it be a defense that a reasonable person would have perceived no real threat and suffered no apprehension? While there are no reported cases involving such scenarios, some commentators believe that when the actor engages in conduct with full knowledge of the unusual sensitivity of the victim and for the purpose of instilling an apprehension of an imminent battery, liability for assault should be permitted as an exception to the normal rule requiring the apprehension to be reasonable. <i>See</i> Restatement of Torts (Second) §27, cmt. a (1965).</p>

<p id="6594dc12-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">We have already seen how the intent generally associated with the torts of battery and assault are somewhat different—the former involving an intention to make harmful contact, and the latter involving the intention to cause the imminent apprehension of such contact. What happens if one intends a harmful contact and misses, but the other still experiences a reasonable apprehension of the near miss? Or what if the contact occurs but the victim, seeing the contact about to occur, experiences this apprehension? What about the person who merely intends to scare someone with such contact but accidentally hits the victim? Finally, what liability attaches if the defendant intends to hit Joe, but misses and hits Jane standing nearby instead? The following case helps to answer each of these hypothetical situations by discussing and applying the tort doctrine of transferred intent.</p>

<p id="6595032a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On January 14, 1993, Marcus was at his parents’ home with another youth after school. Although, at that time, Marcus was, pursuant to his parents’ wishes, actually living in a different neighborhood with a relative and attending a different high school in the hope of avoiding gang-related problems, he had sought and received permission from his father to come to the McBryde house that day to retrieve some clothing. Prior to that date, Marcus had discovered a loaded gun hidden under the mattress of his parents’ bed. James McBryde had purchased the gun sometime earlier.</p>
<p id="6595032b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Soon after midday, Marcus noticed some other youths in a car approaching the McBryde house, and he retrieved the gun from its hiding place. After one of the other youths began shooting towards the McBryde house, Marcus fired four shots toward the car containing the other youths.</p>
<p id="6595032c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During the exchange of gunfire one bullet struck plaintiff, who lived next to the McBryde residence, causing an injury to his abdomen that required extensive medical treatment. Although plaintiff testified that it was Marcus who shot him, the trial court made no finding as to whether plaintiff was struck by a bullet fired by Marcus.</p>

<p id="65952942-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, the trial court found that there was no evidence indicating that Marcus intended to shoot at plaintiff. Furthermore, based upon statements by Marcus that he was not purposely trying to hit the other youths but, instead, was shooting at their car, the trial court also determined that plaintiff had failed to prove Marcus intended to make contact with any person other than plaintiff. Based upon this second finding…the trial court concluded that the doctrine of transferred intent could not apply to create liability for battery upon plaintiff. We conclude <span title="57" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-57">p. 57</span>that, in reaching its determination that no battery occurred, the trial court did not properly analyze the intent required for battery or the transferability of such intent.</p>
<p id="65952943-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As set forth above, the intent element for battery is satisfied if the actor either intends to cause a harmful or offensive contact or if the actor intends to cause an imminent apprehension of such contact. Moreover, with respect to the level of intent necessary for a battery and the transferability of such intent, Restatement (Second) of Torts §16 (1965) provides as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65952944-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">(1) If an act is done with the intention of inflicting upon another an offensive but not a harmful bodily contact, or of putting another in apprehension of either a harmful or offensive bodily contact, and such act causes a bodily contact to the other, the actor is liable to the other for a battery although the act was not done with the intention of bringing about the resulting bodily harm.</p>
<p id="65952945-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(2) If an act is done with the intention of affecting a third person in the manner stated in Subsection (1), but causes a harmful bodily contact to another, the actor is liable to such other as fully as though he intended so to affect him. <i>See also</i> Restatement (Second) of Torts §20 (1965); <i>Alteiri v. Colasso,</i> 362 A.2d 798 (Conn. 1975) (when one intends an assault, then, if bodily injury results to someone other than the person whom the actor intended to put in apprehension of harm, it is a battery actionable by the injured person).</p></div>
<p id="65952946-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, the trial court considered only whether Marcus intended to inflict a contact upon the other youths. It did not consider whether Marcus intended to put the other youths in apprehension of a harmful or offensive bodily contact.</p>
<p id="65952947-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, we conclude, as a matter of law, that by aiming and firing a loaded weapon at the automobile for the stated purpose of protecting his house, Marcus did intend to put the youths who occupied the vehicle in apprehension of a harmful or offensive bodily contact. Hence, pursuant to the rule set forth in Restatement (Second) of Torts §16(2) (1965), Marcus’ intent to place other persons in apprehension of a harmful or offensive contact was sufficient to satisfy the intent requirement for battery against plaintiff.</p>
<p id="65952948-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, we conclude that the cause must be remanded for additional findings as to whether the bullet that struck plaintiff was fired by Marcus.

<p id="6595294b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Transfer Between Torts and Persons.</i></b> The transfer of intent doctrine helps to solve two different potential problems a victim might have, both illustrated by the <i>Hall</i> case. One problem was that the defendant did not intend to shoot anyone, yet was being sued for battery. The other problem was that the <span title="58" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-58">p. 58</span>defendant’s conduct (i.e., trying to frighten those in the car) was directed toward someone other than the plaintiff.</p>
<p id="6595294c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Transfer of Intent Between Victims.</i></b> Courts generally will apply the transfer of intent doctrine to permit the unintended victim to recover, so long as the defendant has the intent to commit the tort against another. You have seen several cases already where the court mentioned the policy of permitting the innocent victim to recover against someone who had the requisite bad intent. This policy is embodied in the transfer of intent doctrine as well.</p>
<p id="6595505d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Transfer of Intent Between Torts.</i></b> Certainly courts will permit the intent to commit an assault to transfer to a battery cause of action, and vice versa. This makes sense because assault and battery are such related causes of action. Although there is some historic precedent for permitting this doctrine to apply among other intentional torts, modern application of this doctrine between torts other than assault and battery is very rare.</p>
<p id="6595505e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Self-defense.</i></b> If the original intent was not wrongful there is no wrongful bad intent to transfer to another tort cause of action. The facts in <i>Hall</i> indicate a possible argument by the defendant of self-defense or defense of property. If such a defense were found valid on these facts, the plaintiff would be unable to recover against the defendant because the original action would have been justified. The defendant in <i>Hall</i> did not apparently raise such any such defense. These defenses, among others, are covered in the next chapter.</p>

<p id="65955062-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">The tort of assault protects one’s particular state of mind—the right to be free from the imminent apprehension of being battered. This claim is often coupled with a battery cause of action when the apprehension is followed by the harmful or offensive contact. Because victims are often aware of the impending battery, assault claims are frequently coupled with battery claims; this coupling occurs so frequently that courts and lawyers commonly use the phrase “assault and battery.” But remember that one claim might exist without the other. If you are on the receiving end of a harmful contact but did not know it was about to happen, you have a battery without an assault. And any time there is an attempted, but unsuccessful battery, there still might be an assault if the intended victim was aware of the near miss. The close relationship between these two particular torts is at the heart of the doctrine of transfer of intent.</p>

This tort claim has been recognized for a long time. We all face certain limitations on our movement. Twelve-year-olds cannot drive the family car, and must be physically present at school in their seat at 8:00 a.m. on Monday mornings. A mid-level manager has to arrive for work in a timely manner and stay at his desk except for lunch and bathroom breaks. You must generally stop at a red light and cannot proceed through the intersection, until granted permission by the green light. These intrusions are not the subject of this tort cause of action. As you read the following cases, try to distill the key elements of a false imprisonment claim that help to differentiate between inconveniences that our society tolerates, and misconduct that so threatens one’s liberty interest as to give rise to a common law cause of action for false imprisonment.</p>

Specifically, the defendant sheriff asserts that his good faith precludes a finding of a false imprisonment. Plaintiff argues that the sheriff’s good or bad faith is not material to the claim. Defendant contends that because he did not intend to commit any wrongful conduct, he cannot be liable for an intentional tort.

Two flagpoles stand outside the entrance, and several vehicles are parked in two narrow lots along the street." src="./ Chapter 2- Intentional Torts_files/9781454899273_UWTR_2E_Ch02_fg003.png" style="max-width:200px"></div></div><p></p></div>
<p id="6595c5a8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The evidence in this case is largely undisputed. On September 9, 1962, the appellant, William Whirl, was arrested on suspicion of felony theft by the City of Houston police and placed in the Houston city jail. Two days later Whirl was transferred to the Harris County jail where he was booked, identified, and deprived, of the use of his artificial leg. On September 20, 1962, an examining trial was held and Whirl was bound over to the Harris County Grand Jury. Some weeks later the Grand Jury returned two indictments against him, one for burglary and one for theft.</p>
<p id="6595c5a9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On November 4, 1962, on the motion of the Harris County District Attorney, the indictments pending against Whirl were dismissed by a [criminal court] judge. The District Attorney had sought and obtained dismissal of the indictments on the grounds that the evidence against Whirl was “insufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction.” The minutes of the court for November 5, 1962, recited the dismissal of the indictments, and a list of dismissals was then sent to the Sheriff’s office, but the Sheriff who keeps the county jail testified that he was not apprised of these proceedings. As a result, Whirl languished in jail for almost nine months after all charges against him were dismissed, and was not restored to his freedom until July 25, 1963.</p>
<p id="6595c5aa-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The breakdown in communication which led to Whirl’s prolonged detention is not easy to trace. Documents are constantly transmitted among the courts, the District Clerk’s office, the District Attorney’s office, and the Sheriff’s office, and recollection as to what happened in any particular instance is necessarily vague. Nevertheless, it is clear that the communication failure in Whirl’s case occurred primarily between the District Clerk’s office and the Sheriff’s office.</p>
<p id="6595c5ab-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ordinarily, when charges are dismissed by a nolle prosequi, a member of the District Clerk’s staff prepares a dismissal slip and forwards it to the Warrant Division of the Sheriff’s office. Since the two offices are in the same building along with the jail, such communications are routinely made several times a day.</p>
<div class="epub-feature epub-feature1 cc-feature-sidebar epub-feature-sidebar epub-sidebar-right">
<p id="6595c5ad-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">“<i>Nolle prosequi</i>” is a Latin phrase used to describe a formal entry upon the record by the prosecutor declaring that she “will not further prosecute” the matter—a voluntary dismissal of charges.</p>
</div>
<p id="6595ecbe-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A record of the dismissals is also recorded in a journal or ledger kept in the District Clerk’s office. This journal is sent to the Sheriff’s office regularly, either separately or in conjunction with the dismissal slips, and receipt of the journal is acknowledged in writing by a sheriff’s deputy. It is also customary for deputies in the Sheriff’s office to make trips to the District Clerk’s office in order to check the dismissal book themselves.</p>
<span title="61" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-61">p. 61</span>
<p id="6595ecbf-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the occasion following termination of charges against Whirl, dismissals had been rather numerous. As a result the Clerk’s office prepared a list of cases which had been dismissed instead of the usual individual dismissal slip for each prisoner. This procedure, though rare, had been used before on similar occasions. Whirl’s name was unquestionably included on that list, and the list was duly received by the Sheriff’s office. Whirl’s name was also entered in the dismissal book.</p>
<p id="6595ecc0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For some reason never adequately explained, the list of dismissals was not processed, and Whirl’s freedom was lost in a shuffle of papers. Being too poor to raise bail, he was forced to remain in the courthouse lockup. Months later when attempts to set his case for trial prompted the District Attorney to check his file, it was discovered that all charges against him had been dismissed. Following his release, Whirl filed this suit.</p>
<p id="6595ecc1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whirl brought his action against C.V. (Buster) Kern, the Sheriff of Harris County, Texas. Trial was to a jury. At the close of all the evidence, plaintiff moved for a directed verdict, and when his motion was denied, the case was submitted to the jury on special interrogatories as to negligence, contributory negligence, proximate cause, and damages. The jury found that Kern was not negligent in detaining Whirl in custody. It also found that Whirl was not contributorily negligent in failing to seek his own release, and that he had suffered no damages as a result of his imprisonment. On this appeal, Whirl contends that the district court erred in not granting his motion for a directed verdict and in denying his motion for a new trial as to damages. Appellant argues that all the elements of his cause of action under the Texas law of false imprisonment were established as a matter of law by the undisputed evidence, and that no fact issue apart from damages remained for the jury. He further argues that the jury’s finding of no damages was contrary to the weight of the evidence and that the district court erred in instructing the jury to disregard the removal of appellant’s artificial leg in assessing the extent of his injury.</p>
<p id="6595ecc2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellee, Kern, responds to these allegations of error by defending each act of the district court [by contending] that his incarceration of Whirl was entirely free of improper motive or unlawful intent.</p>
<p id="6595ecc3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We turn to appellant’s contention that he was entitled as a matter of law to a directed verdict on the question of liability. Appellant’s argument in brief is that the common law of false imprisonment [does not] require that a jailer have actual knowledge that his prisoner’s incarceration is contrary to law. Whirl contends that negligence is not an element of false imprisonment and that the “good faith” of a jailer is neither a defense to nor a justification for an unlawful restraint.</p>
<p id="6595ecc4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While the issue of Sheriff Kern’s “good faith” in confining Whirl in prison was never in so many words presented to the jury, we do not involve ourselves in the semantics of whether or not a finding of non-negligence is tantamount to a finding of good faith. As we read [prior case law] neither good faith nor non-negligence can exculpate Kern from liability.</p>
<p id="6595ecc5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Cases relied upon by Sheriff Kern] were on their facts, false arrest cases and not false imprisonment cases. While it is certainly true that false arrest cases are often denominated actions for false imprisonment, false imprisonment deriving from an arrest and false imprisonment where no arrest has occurred are in <span title="62" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-62">p. 62</span>substance quite different. Admittedly, a person who is falsely arrested is at the same time falsely imprisoned, <i>Fox v. McCurnin</i>, 1928, 218 N.W. 499, yet “it is not necessary, to commit false imprisonment, either to intend to make an arrest or actually to make an arrest.” 32 Am. Jur. 2d, False Imprisonment, §2 (1968). “False arrest is merely one means of committing a false imprisonment.” <i>Harrer v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co</i>., 1950, 221 P.2d 428, 433.</p>
<p id="6595ecc6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In ascertaining whether the Supreme Court intended the defense of “good faith” to apply to false imprisonment as well as to false arrest, we must not allow a superficial similarity between essentially different causes of action to dictate the purpose which the good faith defense is meant to serve. There can be no quarrel with the fact that “good faith” in the circumstances of an arrest is a necessary and historically validated defense. As said by the Supreme Court, “A policeman’s lot is not so unhappy that he must choose between being charged with dereliction of duty if he does not arrest when he has probable cause, and being mulcted in damages if he does.” 386 U.S. at 555.</p>
<p id="659613d7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The reasons for this broad protection are clear. An arrest is often a stressful and unstable situation calling for discretion, speed, and on-the-spot evaluation. As a result, constabulary latitudinarianism is important, and peace officers are and must be endowed with privileges not accorded to ordinary citizens. In the words of the editors of the Restatement of Torts, Second:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="659613d8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">The additional privilege is given because the peace officer has a duty to the public to prevent crime and arrest criminals; the performance of these duties would be seriously impaired unless peace officers were given considerable discretion in their performance and protected from liability for the consequences of honest and reasonable mistakes.</p></div>
<p id="659613d9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">§121, Comment (b) and (c) at 206.</p>
<p id="659613da-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellees urge that the above rule is their shield and protection. However, the breadth of a peace officer’s privilege in an arrest situation is not necessarily the test of the breadth of a jailer’s privilege in the context of a false imprisonment. There is no privilege in a jailer to keep a prisoner in jail beyond the period of his lawful sentence. While a jailer cannot be held liable for errors in a warrant of commitment fair and valid on its face, it is also the law that where a prisoner is held in jail without a court order or written mittimus, the jailer is liable for false imprisonment. The fact that the jailer is without personal knowledge that the prisoner is held unlawfully does not constitute a defense to an action for false imprisonment. In fact, “An illegal imprisonment must be treated as a wrong from its very inception, and it matters not on what date knowledge of such illegality is acquired.” <i>Emanuele v. State</i>, 1964, 250 N.Y.S.2d 361, 366.</p>
<p id="659613db-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case at bar is not, as appellees would have us view it, a case of justifiable reliance upon a warrant of commitment valid on its face. Cf. <i>Francis v. Lyman, supra</i>; <i>Peterson v. Lutz</i>, <i>supra</i>. The sheriff relied on nothing and his actions were not informed actions. Nor is this a situation where the dismissal of an indictment by a grand jury still leaves questions for judicial determination. Cf. <i>Lowry v. Thompson</i>, 1936, 184 S.E. 891 (Ga. App. 1936). Proceedings against Whirl were terminated by the actions of a court of competent jurisdiction. While not easily <span title="63" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-63">p. 63</span>characterized, the case at bar seems to us closest to the situation where the jailer keeps a prisoner beyond the lawful term of his sentence. In such circumstance, as in the one before us, ignorance of the law is no excuse.</p>
<p id="659613dc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not find any cases nor are we referred to any by counsel which provide that “good faith” is a defense to an imprisonment that is not only without valid process, but contrary to it. Nor do we believe as a matter of federal policy that such a defense should be available to a jailer in circumstances like those before us. The responsibility for a failure of communication between the courts and the jailhouse cannot justifiably be placed on the head of a man immured in a lockup when the action of the court has become a matter of public record. Ignorance and alibis by a jailer should not vitiate the rights of a man entitled to his freedom. A jailer, unlike a policeman, acts at his leisure. He is not subject to the stresses and split second decisions of an arresting officer, and his acts in discharging a prisoner are purely ministerial. Moreover, unlike his prisoner, the jailer has the means, the freedom, and the duty to make necessary inquiries. While not a surety for the legal correctness of a prisoner’s commitment, he is most certainly under an obligation, often statutory, to carry out the functions of his office. Those functions include not only the duty to protect a prisoner, but also the duty to effect his timely release.</p>
<p id="659613dd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The central issue in this case is one of privilege, not of intent; one of law, not of fact. The tort of false imprisonment is an intentional tort. Restatement of Torts, Second, §44. It is committed when a man intentionally deprives another of his liberty without the other’s consent and without adequate legal justification. <i>Roberts v. Hecht Co</i>., 280 F. Supp. 639, 640 (D. Md. 1968); <i>Browning v. Pay-Less Self Service Shoes, Inc.</i>, 373 S.W.2d 71 (1963 Tex. Civ. App., no writ). Failure to know of a court proceeding terminating all charges against one held in custody is not, as a matter of law, adequate legal justification for an unauthorized restraint. Were the law otherwise, Whirl’s nine months could easily be nine years, and those nine years, ninety-nine years, and still as a matter of law no redress would follow. The law does not hold the value of a man’s freedom in such low regard.</p>
<p id="659613de-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The sheriff, of course, must have some protection too. His duty to his prisoner is not breached until the expiration of a reasonable time for the proper ascertainment of the authority upon which his prisoner is detained. We are not to be interpreted as holding that a sheriff commits an instant tort at the moment when his prisoner should have been released. However, in the present case what is or is not a reasonable time is not at issue. It may safely be said that Kern’s ignorance for nine long months after the termination of all proceedings against Whirl was, as a matter of law, ignorance for an unreasonable time.</p>
<p id="65963aef-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Texas law of false imprisonment zealously safeguards the rights of citizens to be free of unlawful arrest and unlawful prison detention. Persons found guilty of false imprisonment are subject to both criminal and civil penalties.</p>
<p id="65963af0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Good faith may clear the conscience, but it does not redeem or purge the act. [T]he duty to release is absolute if no such authority exists, and such duty cannot be conditioned on notice, solicitation, ignorance or blindness. Ignorance of the law is traditionally no excuse, even when a man’s own liberty is at stake. Should it be a defense for officers of the law whose sworn duty it is to protect <span title="64" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-64">p. 64</span>the liberty of others? Are a sheriff’s statutory obligations to be effective only when he acts in willful disobedience of his official responsibilities?</p>
<p id="65963af1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The evidence is undisputed that Kern could have known of the dismissal of charges against Whirl had he only made inquiry. But inquiry he did not make, and as a consequence Whirl, quasi-literate and one-legged, languished in jail for nine months after he was entitled to be free of his fetters. Unfortunately, non-malicious restraint is no sweeter than restraint evilly motivated, and we cannot sanction chains without legal justification even if they be forged by the hand of an angel. Neither the sheriff’s tears of regret nor explanations keyed the lock to unmanacle Whirl. Though we apply all the benign adjectives in our lexicon to Kern’s watchmanship—these do not make Whirl a November to July free man.</p>
<p id="65963af2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As we understand the Texas law of false imprisonment, read in conjunction with the statutory duties of the sheriff as keeper of the county jail, non-negligence is no modifier of liability. Sheriff Kern had an unyielding duty to know his prisoner’s sentence time, and this duty was not discharged.</p>
<p id="65963af3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Viewed on one level, the facts of this case involve nothing more grandiloquent than paper pushing between officers in the Harris County Courthouse. Yet we must never forget that we are dealing with a man’s liberty, and a game of who has the paper and who saw the paper is not constitutionally playable. This must be borne in mind in the assessment of damages. Traditionally the fact of an illegal restraint creates the right to recover at least <i>nominal</i> damages. Perhaps in some circumstances that is all a man’s freedom is worth, but though the price tag be a bargain, freedom is never valueless. A jury finding that a man’s freedom is worthless is clearly erroneous. It is an impossible judgment to render against a sentient person, be he one legged, unschooled, friendless or without earning capacity.</p>
<p id="65963af4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is the promise outstanding that the courts will redress the false imprisonment of any man, “no matter how poor or obscure, and no matter what may be his station in life.” <i>McBeath v. Campbell, supra</i>, 12 S.W.2d at 122. Let that promise be fulfilled.</p>

<p id="6596620f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Roles of Judges and Juries.</i></b> Most tort cases that survive the pretrial motion process are submitted to juries for final resolution. Juries are considered the “judges of the facts,” which means that they are to determine the true facts that gave rise to a claim. In fact, their job is somewhat broader than this sounds. In reality, they are charged with applying the law to the evidence to determine if a cause of action should prevail or not. So long as the trial judge believes that a rational jury might find for either party, there exists what is called in Civil Procedure a “genuine issue of material fact.” This is why parties have trials—to determine what really happened. Where the important facts are undisputed, the judge can declare the litigation winner by applying the law to those facts. In submitting a case to a jury, the judge will often rely upon pattern jury instructions that attempt to summarize the law to the jury. In the <i>Kern</i> case, above, the court decided that the elements of the tort claim of false imprisonment did not require any attention from the jury because the important facts were not disputed. At the end of the opinion, the court reverses the judgment that had been rendered for the defendant and remands the case solely for a new trial on the issue of damages.</p>
<p id="65968920-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Criminal vs. Civil Law.</i></b> One potential area of confusion from this case is the interplay between criminal law and procedure, and our civil tort system. How does the status of the criminal charges impact the accrual of a civil cause of action in this case for false imprisonment? Further, how might the same conduct give rise to both a criminal prosecution and a civil cause of action? What would be the purpose of permitting both criminal and civil cases to proceed against the same person?</p>
<div class="epub-feature epub-feature1 cc-feature-sidebar epub-feature-sidebar epub-sidebar-right">

<p id="65968923-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Lawyers and judges alike often place great reliance upon published “pattern” jury instructions. Lawyers tend to pull proposed instructions from such published materials to submit to the court as proposed instructions. They are not authoritative statements of the law, but a pretty reliable source of how the law should be explained to the jury. Judges routinely place great value on their accuracy in preparing the final instructions to give to the jury.</p>
</div>
<p id="65968924-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Timing.</i></b> The sequence of events is important in this case. At what point was plaintiff first detained? Did he have a tort cause of action at this moment? If not, at what point in his detention does the tort claim arise? Notice that the court characterizes the <i>Whirl</i> case as being one about “privilege.” While it was clear that the defendant intended to detain the plaintiff, this was privileged for so long as charges were pending.</p>
<span title="66" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-66">p. 66</span>
<p id="65968925-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Good Faith.</i></b> Why does the availability of a “good faith” defense exist in a false arrest claim but not in a false imprisonment claim? The arresting officer has a privilege to detain in order to make the arrest, which is something that must occur at once. As a matter of public policy, do we want officers to be able to detain others even where there is the possibility of innocence? Consider the different functions of the arresting officer and the prison warden, and to what extent each is under time pressure to make the decision of whether to effectuate or continue detention.</p>
<p id="65968926-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. <i>Accidents as Intentional Torts.</i></b> It may be difficult to comprehend how someone like the plaintiff could simply fall between the cracks for nine months. Of course, the Harris County Sheriff’s Office is a very large operation. It is the third largest sheriff’s office in the United States, behind Los Angeles and Cook County (Illinois), and currently employs over 3,500 staff overseeing 11,000 prisoners at any one time. This might help to explain the accidental over-detention of the plaintiff. Since all indications are that the defendant in this case was not trying to do any wrong, why was an intentional tort theory applicable? For any particular intentional tort claim, you must be precise in your understanding as to what exactly must be intended. For the intentional tort of false imprisonment, courts agree that all that must be intended is the detention. There is no requirement that the detention occur maliciously or with some evil intent. The Restatement (Second) of Torts §8(A) defines the intent, or degree of willfulness, needed in an intentional tort claim as follows: “Intent…[is when] the actor desires to cause consequences of his act, or…believes that the consequences are substantially certain to result from it.” Why are the facts undisputed with regard to the defendant’s intent to detain the plaintiff in <i>Whirl</i>?</p>
<p id="6596b037-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>6. <i>Damages.</i></b> The subject of awarding damages, whether compensatory, nominal, or punitive, is covered in Chapter 8 of this book. Many damage principles apply across the lines of various tort causes of action. But sometimes there are particular damage rules that uniquely apply to a particular cause of action. In another portion of the <i>Kern</i> opinion, the court indicated that the different type of damages that might be recoverable for false imprisonment could include pain and suffering, emotional distress, and lost earnings while incarcerated. In addition, the court mentions the availability of <i>nominal damages</i>—damages in “name only” that are a token award in the absence of actual harm to at least provide some philosophical vindication of the plaintiff’s rights. These damage concepts are covered in substantial detail later in Chapter 8 of this book.</p>

<p id="6596b03d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">A Waco man is deciding if he will sue the county because he was wrongfully detained for 83 days after the district attorney’s office declined his case for prosecution but failed to notify the McLennan County Jail.</p>
<p id="6596b03e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Damion Wayne Evans, 33, stayed in the county jail with no other charges pending against him for almost three months after the district attorney’s office declined to prosecute him on a tampering with physical evidence charge.</p>
<p id="6596d74f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">District Attorney Abel Reyna said Evans’ improperly extended incarceration was the fault of his office. His staff did not fax a case disposition report to the sheriff’s office so it would know to release Evans.</p>
<p id="6596d750-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">“I will accept responsibility for the error in my office, and my apologies go to Mr. Evans,” Reyna said. “Though it doesn’t change what happened to him, the only thing I can do is work hard to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”</p>
<p id="6596d751-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">The decision to refuse the case was made Oct. 25, two weeks after Evans’ arrest. Once that decision was made, the disposition report should have been sent to the jail and Evans should have been released, Reyna said.</p>
<p id="6596d752-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">But the error was not discovered until Jan. 17, after Evans’ attorney, David Bass, filed a motion asking Judge Ralph Strother to set a bail Evans could afford because he had been in jail more than 90 days and had not been indicted.</p>
<p id="6596d753-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">“The normal thing that happens is they send over a disposition report to the jail that the case was not accepted on this particular date, and if there are no other holds on him, they turn him loose,” Bass said.</p>
<p id="6596d754-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">“That is what is supposed to happen in a perfect world, but that is not what happened in Mr. Evans’ world. He spent Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s locked up when he shouldn’t have been,” Bass said.</p>
<p id="6596d755-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">He said he referred Evans to Waco attorney James Rainey for possible civil legal action.</p>
<p id="6596d756-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">“I am going to investigate the matter to determine what happened, why it happened and figure out what recourse, if any, Mr. Evans has for his civil rights violations and his false imprisonment,” Rainey said Tuesday.</p>

<p id="6596fe71-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">James Smith sued Comair, Inc. and Delta Airlines, Inc. for false imprisonment. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Comair on the grounds that Smith’s claim must be dismissed for failure to state a claim. Smith appeals. We agree that Smith’s tort claim should be dismissed. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>
<p id="65972582-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the instant case comes to us at the summary judgment stage, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to Smith, the nonmoving party. On the morning of October 5, 1995, Smith boarded a 6:40 a.m. Comair flight in Roanoke, Virginia to travel to Minneapolis, Minnesota, with a layover in the Cincinnati airport. Comair representatives did not ask Smith for proof of identification when he boarded the flight in Roanoke. In Cincinnati, Smith met some business associates and together they attempted to board the 9:00 a.m. connecting flight to Minneapolis. When Smith began to board, however, the Comair representative asked him “to step aside.” After complying with this request and watching the rest of the flight’s passengers board, Smith asked why he was not permitted to board. A Comair representative told Smith that a supervisor would be called. The supervisor, Mr. Price, arrived approximately thirty minutes after the Minneapolis flight’s departure. According to Smith, Price would not explain why Smith could not fly out of the Cincinnati airport. Meanwhile, Smith also noticed for the first time two security guards standing approximately fifty and seventy feet away observing him. Smith testified that these officers watched him throughout the rest of his stay in the Cincinnati airport.</p>
<p id="65972583-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Three hours later, Price finally told Smith he was denied permission to board the Minneapolis flight because he did not match the physical description contained in his Delta frequent-flyer account. Smith, however, called his company’s travel agent and learned that Delta did not maintain a record of physical descriptions in connection with frequent-flyer accounts. Smith, therefore, located Price and confronted him with this information. Price continued to insist that the dissimilar physical description was the reason Smith was not permitted to board.</p>
<span title="69" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-69">p. 69</span>
<p id="65972584-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At approximately 1:00 or 2:00 p.m., Price returned to Smith and told him the real reason he was refused permission to board was that the Roanoke Comair representatives had failed to ask for photo identification, as shown by the absence of pink highlighting on his boarding pass. At some point, Price explained that the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) required photo identification pursuant to security regulations. Smith replied that he could not produce his driver’s license because he had left it in the glove compartment of his car, which was parked at the Roanoke airport. Price then asked Smith instead for his birth certificate and social security card, neither of which Smith had at the time. Smith offered to have his physical description faxed by the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles (“DMV”) or to pay Comair’s expenses if they would enter his car, retrieve his driver’s license, and fly it to Cincinnati on the next available flight. Price refused both options, as DMV could not fax a photo and entering Smith’s car might expose Comair to liability.</p>
<p id="65972585-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, sometime after 3:00 p.m., Price gave Smith a ticket to Roanoke and told him Comair would return him there. While waiting to board the flight, Smith spoke to Price again and stated that he was so angry he “would like to punch [Price] in the mouth.” In response, Price motioned for the two security guards Smith previously had observed, one of whom was a Cincinnati police officer. When the two approached and restrained Smith, Price asked them to remove Smith from the terminal. After Smith explained his situation to the guard and police officer, the officer intervened on Smith’s behalf and convinced Price to permit Smith to fly to Roanoke. Smith then returned to Roanoke.</p>
<p id="65972586-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Smith filed [this case in Virginia state court alleging false imprisonment]. After the case was removed to the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Comair. The court found that Smith’s tort causes of action failed to state a claim. Smith now appeals.</p>

<p id="65972589-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">You will encounter many instances in this book where courts from different states will follow different rules of law. Lawyers are strategic about the position they take on choice of law issues—which state’s law should be applied to their case. Sometimes these considerations lead lawyers to file a case in one state rather than another, in cases where multiple venues might be appropriate.</p>
</div>
<p id="6597258a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[W]e agree with the district court that he failed to state a claim. Because Virginia follows a lex loci delicti standard, and the incidents underlying Smith’s claims occurred in the Cincinnati airport located in northern Kentucky, his tort claims are governed by Kentucky law.</p>
<p id="6597258b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Smith argues he was falsely imprisoned primarily because Comair flew him to the Cincinnati airport and stranded him there. These allegations, however, fail to state a claim for this tort. Kentucky defines false imprisonment as “‘any exercise of force, by which in fact the other person is deprived of his liberty and compelled to remain where he does not wish to remain or to go where he does not wish to go.’” <i>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Mitchell,</i> 877 S.W.2d 616, 617 (Ky. App. 1994) (quoting <i>Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. v. <span title="70" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-70">p. 70</span>Smith,</i> 281 Ky. 583, 136 S.W.2d 759, 767 (Ky. 1940)). Smith’s evidence simply does not show that he was compelled either to remain or to go anywhere he did not wish. He conceded that no Comair representative told him that he must remain in any specific part of the airport or that he was not free to leave the airport. Price told Smith only that Comair would not permit him to board the flight out of Cincinnati. Smith was therefore free at all times to leave the airport or leave Cincinnati altogether by any means he could arrange other than a Comair flight. False imprisonment results only if “the restraint be a total one, rather than a mere obstruction of the right to go where the plaintiff pleases.” W. Page Keeton et al., <i>Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts</i> §11, at 47 (5th ed. 1984). Smith also briefly asserts that restraint by the security officers constituted false imprisonment. However, even he admits that the officers grabbed his arms only momentarily and nonforcefully, and then immediately interceded on his behalf by convincing Price to permit Smith to board a flight back to Roanoke. Smith’s evidence thus fails to support a claim for false imprisonment.</p>
<p id="65974c9c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>

<p id="65974c9f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Choice of Law.</i></b> Observe that a federal court judge sitting in Virginia wrote this opinion but applied Kentucky law to decide the case. In Civil Procedure, you will learn that federal courts are required to apply state law to claims that originate under state rather than federal law. That explains the vertical dichotomy between the federal court choosing to apply state law. There is also a horizontal dichotomy as the Virginia court chooses to apply the law of a sister state. States employ recognized “conflicts of law” principles to help make a reasonable determination of which state’s law ought to be applied to a multistate dispute. The <i>lex loci delicti</i> standard (roughly, the law of the place of the wrong) is commonly used in a tort suit and explains why Kentucky law applied here (since the Cincinnati airport is actually across the Ohio River in Kentucky).</p>
<p id="65974ca0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Detention.</i></b> Is it fair to say that the defendant in this case inhibited the plaintiff’s freedom of movement? Courts historically demand physical confinement to a bounded area in order to find a detention. If the principle underlying recognition of the tort of false imprisonment is to promote individual autonomy, why restrict the tort’s application to more egregious forms of limitation? Courts consider even highly coercive yet not immediate threats as similarly insufficient to constitute a detention. <i>See e.g.,</i> Snyder v. Evangelical Orthodox Church, 216 Cal. App. 3d 297 (1989) (bishop not falsely imprisoned when church members demanded he meditate in isolation for seven days under threat of exposing his adulterous acts, since he was subject to no physical restraint).</p>

<p id="65974ca1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Consciousness of Detention.</i></b> One minor issue that has received some focus from courts is whether the victim of false imprisonment must be aware of their confinement during the applicable time in order to have a valid claim. For example, some claims involve young children or others who are incompetent and are not aware they are being wrongly held. Many courts are willing to recognize a claim under these circumstances so long as the victim has some actual harm arising out of their detention.</p>
<p id="65974ca2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Problems.</i></b> Consider whether the element of detention needed for a false imprisonment claim is satisfied in each of the following scenarios:</p>

<p id="659773b9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">In all likelihood, there are probably more modern false imprisonment cases that arise in the context of shoppers detained for suspected shoplifting than any other scenario. While the common law places great value on individual liberty, it also recognizes the importance of property rights and the need to permit people to engage in certain reasonable behavior to protect their property interests. Balancing these sometimes competing concerns, tort law has created a <i>shopkeeper’s privilege,</i> which creates a legal justification for retailers to detain a shopper under certain circumstances and in a certain manner. In the following case, a Wal-Mart security guard has stopped one suspected shoplifter on her <span title="72" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-72">p. 72</span>way out of the store and required her to remain. As you read this opinion, look for the prerequisites for application of this privilege and for the limitations on its use by the retailer. Also, compare this privilege with that of the jailer discussed in <i>Whirl.</i> Why are they so fundamentally different?</p>

<p id="65979ad0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case involves the proper scope of authority of law in a false imprisonment case. The court of appeals affirmed the trial court’s judgment against Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (“Wal-Mart”) on a jury finding of false imprisonment. We hold that, on the facts in this case, Wal-Mart established as a matter of law that it detained Lucia Resendez for a reasonable period of time, in a reasonable manner, and upon a reasonable belief that she had stolen store merchandise. Accordingly, we reverse the court of appeals’ judgment and render judgment for Wal-Mart.</p>
<p id="65979ad1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On January 20, 1986, Resendez went shopping at Wal-Mart during her lunch break. While browsing through the store, she began to eat from a bag of peanuts marked with a Wal-Mart price sticker. Raul Salinas, a security guard for Wal-Mart, followed Resendez and observed her place the empty bag under a rose bush. He then watched her purchase some items and leave the store. After determining that Resendez had not paid for a bag of peanuts, Salinas followed her into the parking lot. He accused her of taking the bag of peanuts without paying and asked her to accompany him back into the store. Resendez objected that she bought the peanuts the day before at another Wal-Mart store and could provide the receipt to prove it. She then accompanied Salinas to the back of the store. Within about ten to fifteen minutes a police officer arrived and arrested Resendez. Resendez posted bail and was released about one hour later.</p>
<p id="65979ad2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A jury convicted Resendez of misdemeanor theft. Later, the court of appeals overturned her conviction because of a defect in the charging instrument. She then sued Wal-Mart for malicious prosecution, false imprisonment, [and] intentional infliction of emotional distress. The jury awarded Resendez $100,000 for the false imprisonment claim and $25,000 for the negligence claim. The court of appeals modified the judgment, eliminating the $25,000 recovery because it was a double recovery, and affirmed the judgment as modified.</p>
<p id="65979ad3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a false imprisonment case, if the alleged detention was performed with the authority of law, then no false imprisonment occurred. <i>See Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Castillo</i>, 693 S.W.2d 374, 375 (Tex. 1985) (listing the elements of false imprisonment as a willful detention performed without consent and without <span title="73" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-73">p. 73</span>the authority of law). The “shopkeeper’s privilege” expressly grants an employee the authority of law to detain a customer to investigate the ownership of property in a reasonable manner and for a reasonable period of time if the employee has a reasonable belief that the customer has stolen or is attempting to steal store merchandise.

Without deciding the outer parameters of a permissible period of time under section 124.001, the ten to fifteen minute detention in this case was not unreasonable as a matter of law. <i>See Dominguez v. Globe Discount City, Inc.</i>, 470 S.W.2d 919, 920 (Tex. Civ. App.—El Paso 1971, no writ) (finding a five- to six-minute detention reasonable even where the plaintiff was ultimately released by the security guard who detained her); <i>Meadows v. F.W. Woolworth Co.</i>, 254 F. Supp. 907, 909 (N.D. Fla. 1966) (finding a ten-minute detention reasonable under a similar statute). Also, no evidence exists that the detention occurred in an unreasonable manner. The only question is whether it was reasonable for Salinas to believe that Resendez had stolen the peanuts. It was.</p>
<p id="6597c1e8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Based upon the undisputed facts—Resendez looked for peanuts immediately upon entering the Wal-Mart store, she was later seen eating from a bag of peanuts marked with a Wal-Mart price sticker, and she did not pay for the peanuts on leaving the store—probable cause existed to believe that the peanuts were stolen property. In fact, in response to the question on Resendez’s malicious prosecution claim, the jury found that Salinas had probable cause to commence criminal proceedings against Resendez. If Salinas had probable cause to initiate criminal proceedings, his belief that Resendez stole the peanuts was necessarily reasonable. <i>See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Odem</i>, 929 S.W.2d 513, 520 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 996, writ denied) (finding that reasonable belief for an investigative detention is something less than that required to establish probable cause); <i>Berly v. D &amp; L Security Servs. &amp; Investigations, Inc.</i>, 876 S.W.2d 179, 183 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1994, writ denied) (noting that the “shopkeeper’s privilege” under section 124.001 embodies the law of probable cause for the purpose of detaining a suspected shoplifter). As a matter of law, the undisputed facts of this case establish that Salinas had the authority of law to detain Resendez and therefore she was not falsely imprisoned.</p>
<p id="6597c1e9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court of appeals’ discussion of the proper scope of the authority of law to detain fails to recognize the full extent of the privilege granted to persons who suspect shoplifting. First, the court of appeals reasoned that the jury implicitly found that Wal-Mart exceeded the scope of its privilege to detain Resendez. To support this theory, the court of appeals cited one of its own opinions for the principle that compliance with a store’s internal policies is informative in the jury’s determination of whether there was a detention <span title="74" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-74">p. 74</span>without authority of law. We disagree that the internal policies of a private business define the permissible scope of a detention authorized under the law.</p>
<p id="6597c1ea-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the court of appeals erred in its interpretation of the shopkeeper’s privilege. The privilege does not require the detainer to confirm or refute the detainee’s claims, nor does it prevent the detainer from holding the suspected shoplifter for a reasonable time in order to deliver her to the police. <i>See</i> Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. §124.001; <i>see also</i> Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. §18.16 (granting to any person the privilege to seize and detain a person suspected of theft and deliver them to a peace officer).</p>
<p id="6597c1eb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Therefore, the court grants Wal-Mart’s application for writ of error and, without hearing oral argument, reverses the court of appeals’ judgment and renders judgment for Wal-Mart.</p>

In such instances, whether the plaintiff or defendant will prevail will turn on the primary issue of whether there was legal justification for the detention. Such affirmative defenses typically switch the burden of proof from the plaintiff to the defendant. How does the privilege asserted in this case compare with the privilege in <i>Whirl</i> (at the time of the initial incarceration)?</p>

<p id="6598101d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Though classified as an intentional tort, the only thing that must be intended by the defendant in a false imprisonment case is the detention of the plaintiff. And detention does not require prison bars—simply using force or threats to keep someone from being able to move from place to place as they wish. On the other hand, merely inconveniencing someone’s movement is not sufficient to count as detention. Beyond these two issues of intent and actual detention, many false imprisonment cases turn on whether or not the defendant has pled and proven either consent or a legal justification. Be aware that justifications are not all the same. Note that the officer’s good faith was insufficient to create a privilege in <i>Whirl</i>, whereas with respect to the shopkeeper’s privilege, a good faith belief by the defendant that the plaintiff has attempted to steal property is imperative for the application of the justification defense.</p>

<p id="65981022-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">The tort of trespass is ancient and historically has been highly revered due to the law’s concern for protecting property rights. While it is properly classified as an intentional tort, pay close attention to what specifically must be intended, and what need not be, by the defendant in order to be a trespasser. The <i>Thomas</i> case demonstrates confusion by the litigants as to the appropriate standard. The scope of liability of a trespasser for even unforeseen harm caused during a trespass by her actions is considered in the <i>Baker</i> case. The law of trespass encompasses not only encroachments onto another’s land, but also coming into unpermitted contact with another’s personal property. The <i>Sears</i> and <i>Arora</i> cases set forth the various distinctions the law makes in such instances between intermeddling, dispossession, and conversion of another’s personal property.</p>

<p id="6598373d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants, C.N. Thomas and Surplus City, U.S.A. sought damages for common law trespass against appellees, Harrah’s Vicksburg Corporation and W.G. Yates and Sons Construction Co.</p>
<p id="65985e4e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This litigation stems from the development of Harrah’s gambling facility in Vicksburg, Mississippi, beginning over five years ago and acts of trespass admittedly committed by Harrah’s and Yates for an approximate six-month period beginning in July 1993 and continuing through December 1993. The property in question is a vacant lot…wholly owned by Thomas [and leased to Surplus]. Thomas and Surplus repeatedly asked Harrah’s and Yates to refrain from trespassing on the Thomas/Surplus property; however, these requests were ignored by Harrah’s and Yates. After realizing that his attempts to protect his property from trespass clearly were futile, Thomas instituted this litigation.</p>
<p id="65985e4f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thomas and Surplus contend that the intent of the common law trespasser is irrelevant. They cite <i>Kelley v. Sportsmen’s Speedway</i>, 80 So. 2d 785, 791 (1955) <span title="77" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-77">p. 77</span>as support for their contention. <i>Kelley</i> was a premises liability case and defined “trespasser” as “a person who enters the premises of another without license, invitation, or other right, and intrudes for some definite purpose of his own, or at his convenience, or merely as an idler with no apparent purpose, other than, perhaps, to satisfy his curiosity.” Harrah’s and Yates present <i>Berry v. Player,</i> 542 So. 2d 895 (Miss. 1989) in support of their position that negligence is the proper standard to apply. <i>Berry</i> dealt with a jury instruction under <i>Miss. Code Ann. §95-5-3</i> concerning recoverable damages for cutting timber from private property. In that case the Mississippi Supreme Court found a negligence instruction proper.</p>
<p id="65985e50-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think it instructive to briefly look at the historical basis for the trespass to land action. Professors Prosser and Keeton note that “historically, the requirements for trespass to land under the common law action of trespass were an invasion (a) which interfered with the right of exclusive possession of the land, and (b) which was the direct result of some act committed by the defendant.” W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on Torts, §13 at 67 (5th ed. 1984). Further, the tort of trespass to land can be committed by other than simply entering on the land; trespass occurs by placing objects on the property, by causing a third party to go onto the property, or by remaining on property after the expiration of a right of entry. Keeton §13 at 72-73.</p>
<p id="65985e51-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With regard to the requisite intent for trespass to land, the Restatement (Second) of Torts §163 comment (b) addresses this issue:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65985e52-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">b. Intention. If the actor intends to be upon the particular piece of land, it is not necessary that he intend to invade the other’s interest in the exclusive possession of his land. The intention which is required to make the actor liable under the rule stated in this Section is <i>an intention to enter upon the particular piece of land in question</i>, irrespective of whether the actor knows or should know that he is not entitled to enter. It is, therefore, immaterial whether or not he honestly and reasonably believes that the land is his own, or that he has the consent of the possessor or of a third person having power to give consent on his behalf, or that he has a mistaken belief that he has some other privilege to enter. (Emphasis added.)</p></div>
<p id="65985e53-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, as Professors Prosser and Keeton point out, “the intent required as a basis for liability as a trespasser is simply an intent to be at the place on the land where the trespass occurred.” Keeton §13 at 73.</p>
<p id="65985e54-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With this historical basis, we now turn to the merits of the parties’ arguments. Clearly, there is no negligence required for liability for trespass, and we therefore reject Harrah’s and Yates’ invitation to apply a negligence standard to ordinary trespass.</p>
<p id="65985e55-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Thomas and Surplus position is correct in asserting that negligence is not necessary for common law trespass liability. Furthermore, while there is an intent requirement, it is very broad in definition as demonstrated in the Restatement (Second) §163 above. Common law trespass is an intrusion upon the <span title="78" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-78">p. 78</span>land of another without a license or other right for one’s own purpose. The testimony establishes that is exactly the case here.</p>
<p id="65985e56-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two key witnesses, Charles Wells, Harrah’s construction manager for this project, and Jim Smith, the construction superintendent for Yates, admitted that there were trespasses that occurred on Thomas’ property. First, Wells testified that he worked on the project from July 1993 until July 1994, and that he understood that there was a continuing dispute with Thomas over the property lines. Further, Wells admitted that he, as well as Yates, were involved in the decision to move the north wall because it encroached on Thomas’ property. The plans for the facility, according to Wells, called for the building to extend “right up to the property line.…” Questioning by appellants’ counsel also established that the trespass was inevitable:</p>

On direct examination, Smith took great pains to detail how careful Yates was in constructing special scaffolding to avoid trespassing on the Thomas/Surplus property and emphasized the fact that he had personally fired three employees of Yates for trespassing. Additionally, Smith, in a strained and futile effort, attempted to disassociate Yates from the various subcontractors employed by Yates, while admitting that Yates had control over the subcontractors. Yet, on cross-examination, Smith admitted that scaffolding erected by Yates in conjunction with the construction of the facility was indeed on the Thomas/Surplus property and that they received permission from Thomas to enter the property for the <i>specific</i> purpose of removing the scaffolding to halt the trespass. Further, Smith admitted to repeated <span title="79" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-79">p. 79</span>airspace violations on the Thomas/Surplus property with the boom swinging over the property.

<p id="6598d39d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, the testimony of Charles Wells and Jim Smith established that the construction of the Harrah’s facility was on a fast-tract, and it was known that the north wall of the shoreside facility would be very close to the Thomas/Surplus property line and that trespass was unavoidable in the construction process. Appellees go to great lengths to describe the precautions made by the construction personnel to avoid the trespasses. But this is quite simply irrelevant. A picture, or in this case, pictures, are worth thousands of words. It was obvious that deliveries were made, building supplies were stacked, and scaffolding was erected for construction purposes on the Thomas/Surplus property. As indicated by the photographs and the testimony of Wells, the trespass on the Thomas/Surplus property was inevitable. Undoubtedly, trespass occurred at the hands of Harrah’s and Yates during the course of completing this project. While some of the photographs were unable to be directly tied to the appellees, a quantum more proved that the trespasses complained of occurred on the subject property for which Harrah’s was responsible. Appellees’ arguments to the contrary are spurious and not well taken.</p>

A common approach involves creating trespass liability only when actual harm is caused to the landowner’s property. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Public Service Co. of Colorado v.

<p id="659948f4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the court of common pleas, Mrs. Baker filed several claims against the Shymkivs: (1) as administratrix, for the wrongful death of Mr. Baker, and for her own pecuniary loss; and (2) for trespass seeking both compensatory and punitive damages. At trial, two medical experts testified. One concluded that the events of March 22, 1978, could have caused Mr. Baker’s death. The other determined that there was no evidence upon which one could reach that conclusion.</p>
<p id="659948f5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court instructed the jury, in part:</p>

For example, under the Restatement of Torts 2d, intentional conduct is an element of trespass: “One is subject to liability to another for trespass, irrespective of whether he thereby causes harm to any legally protected interest of the other, if he <i>intentionally</i> enters land in the possession of the other or causes a thing or a third person to do so.” (Emphasis added.) Restatement of Torts 2d §158. The Restatement also articulates the scope of liability for a trespass in Section 162, which states: “A trespass on land subjects the trespasser to liability for physical harm to the possessor of the land at the time of the trespass, or to the land or to his things, or to members of his household or to their things, caused by any act done, activity carried on, or condition created by the trespasser, irrespective of whether his conduct is such as would subject him to liability were he not a trespasser.” <i>Id.,</i> at pages 291-292. Comment <i>f</i> to Section 162 of the Restatement explains the intended effect of that provision:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65996f0b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush"><i>f. Peculiar position of trespasser</i>. This Section states the peculiar liability to which a trespasser is subject for bodily harm caused to the possessor of land or the members of his family by the conduct of a trespasser while upon the land, irrespective of whether his conduct if it occurred elsewhere would subject him to liability to them. Thus, one who trespasses upon the land of another incurs the risk of becoming liable for any bodily harm which is cause [<i>sic</i>] to the possessor of the land or to members of his household by any conduct of the trespasser during the continuance of his trespass, no matter how otherwise innocent such conduct may be.</p></div>

We will discuss this test for proximate cause in Chapter 5. Courts historically reject any such requirement for proximate cause in an intentional tort cause of action, such as in the <i>Baker</i> case. So long as the harm caused is considered compensable for the particular intentional tort and actual causation is established, the scope of liability is not typically limited by notions of foreseeability. We saw this same principle applied in the <i>Nelson v. Carroll</i> case involving the battery by the debt collector. However, as the Restatement provision quoted by the court indicates, traditionally the law of trespass has limited liability to those damages caused “during the continuance” of the trespass.</p>

As the <i>Koepnick</i> case discusses below, a trespass to chattels can take the form of either a <i>dispossession</i> or an <i>intermeddling</i>. Either variety can permit the recovery of compensatory damages when the trespass causes actual demonstrable harm to either the personal property or to the owner. As you read the following opinion, therefore, try to discern when the distinction between the two varieties of trespass to chattel claims makes a difference. Following that, we will next encounter a related cause of action to trespass to chattels—a claim for <i>conversion</i>. In the <i>Prince Kumar Arora</i> case we will see the court distinguish between these two very related claims in the context of a mad scientist caught destroying another’s science experiment.</p>

He verified the sale and informed Lessard that he had put the wrench in a small bag, stapled it shut, and then placed that bag into a large bag containing Koepnick’s other purchases. The small bag was not among the items in Koepnick’s possession in the security room. To determine whether a second wrench was involved, the police and Lessard searched Koepnick’s truck which was in the mall parking lot. No stolen items were found. Having completed their investigation, the police cited Koepnick for disorderly conduct and released him. The entire detention lasted approximately 45 minutes.</p>

<p id="6599e45e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Restatement</i> recognizes that an award of nominal damages may be made, even in the absence of proof of actual damages, if a trespass to chattel involves a dispossession. <i>See §218, comment d</i>.

<p id="6599e45f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sears’ actions with respect to the trespass consisted of Steve Lessard accompanying a Mesa police officer out to the parking lot and looking in the truck. There is no evidence in the record of an intent on the part of Sears’ employee to claim a possessory interest in the truck contrary to Koepnick’s interest. No lien or ownership interest claim of any kind was made. Further, there is no evidence that Sears intentionally denied Koepnick access to his truck.</p>

In order that an actor who interferes with another’s chattel may be liable, his conduct must affect some other and more important interest of the possessor. Therefore, one who intentionally intermeddles with another’s chattel is subject to liability only if his intermeddling is harmful to the possessor’s materially valuable interest in the physical condition, quality, or value of the chattel, or if the possessor is deprived of the use of the chattel for a substantial time, or some other legally protected interest of the possessor is affected as stated in Clause (c). Sufficient legal protection of the possessor’s interest in the mere inviolability of his chattel is afforded by his privilege to use reasonable force to protect his possession against even harmless interference.</p></div>

<p id="659a0b73-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The search in question took approximately two minutes. Neither the truck nor its contents were damaged in any manner by the police or Sears’ employee. As a matter of law, Sears’ action did not constitute an actionable trespass under <i>§218(c)</i>.</p>
<p id="659a0b74-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In arguing that Sears should not have been given a [judgment] in its favor on the trespass to chattel claim, Koepnick asserts that the search of his truck caused him to remain in custody longer than he would otherwise have been detained. While this may be true, there was no evidence showing any connection between $100 and the few minutes that Koepnick was detained as a result of waiting for that search to be completed—apparently 15 minutes. For a deprivation of use caused by a trespass to chattel to be actionable, the time must be so substantial that it is possible to estimate the loss that is caused. The record in the present case lacks any evidence to permit a jury to estimate any loss caused to Koepnick. It is well settled that conjecture and speculation cannot provide the basis for an award of damages. The evidence must make an approximately accurate estimate possible.</p>
<p id="659a0b75-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if a [judgment] on the claim of trespass could be affirmed on the basis that a dispossession occurred, the award…would necessarily be limited to nominal damages. As discussed above, both parties agree that the $100 award was not nominal. Furthermore, punitive damages were erroneously awarded because punitive damages cannot be awarded absent evidence of actual damages.</p>
<p id="659a0b76-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that there was no dispossession of the vehicle as contemplated under §218 of the <i>Restatement</i> nor was Koepnick deprived of its use for a substantial period of time. Any increase in the length of detention caused by the search is not the kind of interest protected by the tort of trespass to chattel. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court’s [judgment] in favor of Sears on this issue.</p>

<p id="659a3299-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this civil suit for conversion and trespass, the United States contends that Doctor Prince Kumar Arora intentionally tampered with and destroyed cells in a research project at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. <span title="89" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-89">p. 89</span>Dr. Arora denies tampering and in any case responds that the Government sustained no damages by reason of the cell deaths.</p>

On the basis of the evidence and pleadings, the Court concludes that Dr. Arora did tamper with, destroy, and convert Alpha 1-4 cells; that he is liable for the cost of the flasks and materials associated with the creation of the cells as well as the reasonable value of the time it took a laboratory assistant to re-create the cells; and that, while not liable in compensatory damages for the delay he caused in the completion of the research project, he must respond in punitive damages, as to which the effect his actions had on the research project is a relevant consideration.</p>

<p id="659a59ac-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The National Institutes of Health (NIH), part of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, is a world-renowned research and educational facility with extensive laboratories, located in Bethesda, Maryland. NIH conducts research in a number of critical scientific areas.</p>
<p id="659a59ad-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1978, after receiving his Ph.D. in microbiology from Michigan State University, Prince Kumar Arora joined NIH as a Visiting Fellow in the Laboratory of Immunodiagnosis at the National Cancer Institute. There and later as a Staff Fellow in the Laboratory of Developmental and Molecular Immunology at the National Institute of Child Health and Development, he conducted research in immunology, collaborated with other scientists, published his research in scientific journals, and supervised and trained younger researchers working in his laboratories. In 1987, Dr. Phil Skolnick, Chief of the Laboratory of Neuroscience in the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), invited Dr. Arora to conduct immunology research at that institute. From approximately 1987 through 1992, Dr. Arora pursued his research at NIDDK, publishing papers, editing articles for scientific journals, collaborating with other scientists, and continuing his supervision of younger scientists working in the laboratory.</p>
<p id="659a59ae-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1989, Dr. Arora hired a post-doctoral student from Japan, Dr. Yoshitatsu Sei. Dr. Arora served as Dr. Sei’s mentor and together they published several papers setting forth the results of their collaborative research. Consistent with laboratory policy, however, Dr. Sei was free to engage in collaborative projects with other researchers without Dr. Arora’s involvement. Thus, in December 1990, Dr. Sei, who had special expertise in cell culturing, joined Dr. Skolnick and Dr. Garry Wong in a pioneering research project designed to study the immune properties of certain cell receptors. The purpose of the project was to attempt to develop, through a complex method, a brand new line of cells which could be transfected into human cells, which could then be cloned into a sufficient number of the newly created cell line. The cell line, if successful, would have significant implications for studies of alcohol, Alzheimer’s disease, neurotoxicity, and—in the words of Dr. Wong—“just about anything that has to do with regulation of brain cells.”</p>
<span title="90" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-90">p. 90</span>
<p id="659a59af-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Between December 1990 and the beginning of 1992, working from several cell line possibilities, one of which they dubbed “Alpha 1-4,” Drs. Wong and Sei sought to develop a stable cell line. By February 1992, they were successful in creating the Alpha 1-4 cell line and were able to maintain a supply of the line in a deep freeze. What remained, before preparing the manuscript announcing their research to the public and donating the cell line to a national cell bank for use by scientists around the world, were scientific assays, <i>i.e.</i> experiments, to describe the characteristics of the cell line. To perform these assays, multiple flasks, each containing millions of Alpha 1-4 cells, were required.</p>
<p id="659a59b0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Against this scientific background, however, as often happens in life, human passion slowly began to overtake cool reason. [Dr. Sei and Dr. Arora began to have professional jealousy regarding each other’s recognition for certain accomplishments. In addition, their relationship became strained after Dr. Arora was accused of sexually harassing a female graduate assistant later re-assigned to Dr. Sei. Eventually, Dr. Sei discovered that the Alpha 1-4 cells had been tampered with and destroyed. The police were contacted and began an investigation.]</p>
<p id="659a59b1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dr. Arora testified that Detective Miller suddenly began accusing him of killing Dr. Sei’s cells, which Dr. Arora said he vigorously denied. Detective Miller, on the other hand, testified that when he asked Dr. Arora how he killed the cells, Dr. Arora answered “with 2-mercaptoethanol.”</p>
<p id="659a59b2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Following his interview with Dr. Arora, Detective Miller immediately asked his supervisor, Captain Timothy Pickett, to reinterview Dr. Arora out of Miller’s presence. Although Dr. Arora denied saying it, Captain Pickett testified that Dr. Arora clearly admitted to him that he had adulterated cell tissues with “2-merca-something,” a word Captain Pickett could neither remember nor pronounce. Captain Pickett further testified that Dr. Arora stated in effect that “it was the first time I did it; I’ll never do it again.”</p>
<p id="659a59b3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When Dr. Arora left the police interview, he attempted to locate Dr. Skolnick but did not succeed until the following morning. When they finally met, Dr. Skolnick, who had already talked to Detective Miller, immediately confronted Dr. Arora with the question: “Why did you do it?” to which he testified Dr. Arora replied: “To teach Yoshi (Dr. Sei) and Abha (Ms. Saini) a lesson,” suggesting that the two of them were “conspiring against me.” Dr. Skolnick then testified that he went on to say: “You know you can’t work here anymore,” to which Dr. Arora replied “Yes, I know that.”</p>
<p id="659a59b4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dr. Arora denies that he adulterated Dr. Sei’s cells and suggests that if he touched the flasks, it would only have been to move them in the course of getting at other flasks in the incubator where the flasks were located. But the evidence to the contrary is considerable. Only Dr. Sei’s flasks were in the incubator at the time he placed them inside. Dr. Arora’s fingerprints were found on the flasks despite his lack of official authorization to handle them. An adulterating substance with a quick toxic effect, #2-mercaptoethanol, was found in several of the fake experiment flasks, whereas Dr. Sei testified he placed no such chemical in with the “Alpha 1-4” or other cells. Dr. Arora also had a potential animus, which is to say motive, against Dr. Sei—professional rivalry <span title="91" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-91">p. 91</span>as well as possible resentment over Ms. Saini’s shift of allegiance from Dr. Arora to Dr. Sei. Most importantly, three separate witnesses testified that, when confronted with the alleged wrongdoing, Dr. Arora in one fashion or another admitted his culpability.</p>
<p id="659a59b5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court concludes, in this most unhappy affair, that Dr. Arora did in fact tamper with and cause the death of the Alpha 1-4 cells at the NIH laboratory in Bethesda in the Spring of 1992.</p>

He intended to act inconsistently with Dr. Sei’s right to control the cells, he did not act in good faith, and he committed the ultimate harm—he destroyed the cells. While certain easily identifiable expense was caused by Dr. Arora’s inappropriate acts, it is also apparent that he caused serious inconvenience to what was a critically important research project. By this analysis, if any tort was committed, it was unquestionably a conversion, not a mere trespass.</p>

<p id="659aa7e7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The fact is that the United States Supreme Court has recognized that a living cell line is a property interest capable of protection. <i>See Diamond v. Chakrabarty,</i> 447 U.S. 303 (1980<i>)</i> (inventor of a genetically-engineered organism could obtain protection of ownership interests under patent laws). Other courts have likewise acknowledged the cell line’s status as property, <i>see e.g. Pasteur v. United States,</i> 814 F.2d 624 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (donated cell line assumed to be property but transfer held not subject to Contract Disputes Act). The Court thus sees no reason why a cell line should not be considered a chattel capable of being converted. Indeed, if such a cause of action is not recognized, it is hard to conceive what civil remedy would ever lie to recover a cell line that might be stolen or destroyed, including one with immense potential commercial value, as this one apparently had and has. <i>See generally,</i> Catherine M. Valerio Barrad, “<i>Genetic Information and Property Theory</i>,” 87 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1037 (1992). The Court is satisfied, therefore, under the circumstances of this case, that the Alpha 1-4 cell line was capable of being converted and that in fact Dr. Arora converted it. The more difficult question, perhaps, is how to assess damages, the next question before the Court.</p>

Whether the lawyer bringing a claim for such misconduct labels it as trespass or conversion may only affect the typical measure of damages. In some cases, such as in <i>Arora</i>, where the court could not utilize a market value theory of damages, the distinction between the two claims is not particularly important.</p>

<p id="659af615-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These principles find relatively easy application in the present case. The tangible chattels converted consist of the Alpha 1-4 cells and the flasks and related materials which contained them. The latter have a market value of some $176.68, while the value of the former is essentially unascertainable. But the evidence in the record also establishes the cost of creating or recreating the Alpha 1-4 cells at $273.52, the amount attributable to the services of a laboratory assistant necessary to culture the cells. The total of these two sums, $450.20, while modest, is nevertheless nontrivial. It is an amount properly awardable in this case and the Court has determined to award it.</p>
<p id="659af616-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, the Court acknowledges the caveat of <i>Staub</i> that consequential damages may not be “so speculative as to create a danger of injustice.” The Court, therefore, is inclined to agree with Defendant that any effort to quantify with precision damages for delay in the research project would run counter to that principle.</p>

The permission in either instance may either be express or implied from the circumstances. But even the defendant’s good faith belief that he had permission (or consent) for the contact with the property is not a defense, unless the owner has acted in a way that would provide a reasonable manifestation of such consent. Reflecting the judgment that real estate is of greater import than personal property, while courts will also entertain a claim for at least nominal damages in a trespass to land case, courts will only permit a claim for nominal damages in a trespass to chattels if it characterizes the trespass as a dispossession rather than a mere harmless intermeddling. But regardless of label, where actual harm to the property is demonstrated, recovery for the intentional unpermitted touching is available.</p>

<p id="659af622-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Of all of the intentional torts covered in this chapter, the newcomer to the tort block is the claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. This is oftentimes referred to as the tort of “Outrage” because one of its chief elements—outrageous conduct by the defendant—is often the primary focus of a court’s analysis of this claim. Sometimes a defendant’s conduct is extreme and causes real harm, but other existing theories of recovery might be unavailing or provide a less than satisfactory response. In such situations, smart lawyers are able to draw upon existing legal principles to help courts craft a new cause of action. Our first case below involves one state’s decision to recognize this new claim. This cause of action is designed primarily to protect one’s right to be free from severe emotional distress caused by particularly reprehensible conduct. It is quite expansive in that it can be applied to a myriad of different fact patterns. This flexibility is both a benefit and a potential curse—courts are loathe to make it too easy for people to sue for hurt feelings, or else everyone could be considered a tortfeasor. Notice how the elements of this claim are designed to set relatively high hurdles for a claimant to clear in order to have a valid claim under this cause of action.</p>

We find this analysis unpersuasive for two reasons: First, no cause of action was brought for slander, and second, the slander, if proved, would have resulted in a tortious act against the mother, not the child.

Indeed, <i>Korbin</i> is the only authority in this court which is undiluted by an alternative holding that the conduct involved was not outrageous.

Said Millie Dirube falsely represented to Plaintiff that she had received a letter from the eye doctor saying that his eye(s) were OK now and that Plaintiff was no longer disabled and falsely represented to Plaintiff that he was no longer totally disabled, that he was not longer covered under the policy, that the policy was no longer in force, that he had to sign a paper agreeing that no further payments were due under the policy, that it no longer covered him, that he was no longer entitled to receive benefits under the policy and that he was giving up the policy voluntarily. At the time said Millie Dirube made said misrepresentation she knew them to be false and they were in fact false and she made them with the intention and expectation and intention that Plaintiff be deceived and defrauded thereby and that the [sic] sign said paper and surrender the subject policy. Defendants well knew that Plaintiff was suffering both physical and mental total disability and was entitled to benefits under the policy and that the representations of Millie Dirube were false. The foregoing acts were all in violation of their fiduciary relationship and duty of good faith and in an effort to use their superior knowledge skill and position to take advantage of this debilitated Plaintiff.

This combination of the unjustified assertion of power by one party, and impotence of the other, would, we think, be viewed by a civilized community as outrageous and not as an indignity, annoyance or petty oppression for which the law affords no relief.

<p id="659b928e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff, Christiane Zalnis, appeals the partial summary judgment dismissing her outrageous conduct claim against defendants. We reverse.</p>
<p id="659b928f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The following facts appear from viewing the record in a light most favorable to the plaintiff. In January 1978, Zalnis contracted with defendant Thoroughbred Datsun for the purchase of a 1978 Datsun automobile. She took possession of the car on that day, and paid the balance of the purchase price two days later. Zalnis dealt directly with Linnie Cade, a salesperson employed by Thoroughbred Datsun. Defendant Trosper, President of Thoroughbred Datsun, approved the transaction based on representations by Cade which were later determined to be based upon erroneous calculations. When Trosper discovered several days later that Cade had sold the car at a loss of approximately $1,000, he instructed Cade and the sales manager to make good the loss by either demanding more money from Zalnis, retrieving the car, or repaying the difference out of Cade’s salary.</p>
<p id="659b9290-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Cade refused to follow any of Trosper’s alternative instructions, but another sales employee, defendant Anthony, telephoned Zalnis and told her to return her car to the dealership because it was being recalled. When Zalnis arrived at Thoroughbred Datsun, she refused to give up possession of her car without a work order explaining the need for the recall. Nevertheless, her car was taken from her. During the next few hours, Zalnis alleges that Anthony called her a “French whore,” followed her throughout the showroom, told her they were keeping her automobile, yelled, screamed, used abusive language, grabbed her <span title="101" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-101">p. 101</span>by the arm in a threatening manner, and continually threatened and intimidated her when she attempted to secure the return of her automobile by telling her to “shut up.”</p>
<p id="659b9291-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During this period, Zalnis telephoned her attorney, who then telephoned Trosper and eventually obtained the return of her car. During their conversation, Trosper told the attorney that Zalnis had “been sleeping with that nigger salesman and that’s the only reason she got the deal she got.” Trosper had known Zalnis for many years, and had told Cade and the sales manager that she was crazy and she had watched her husband kill himself.</p>
<p id="659b9292-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thoroughbred Datsun and Trosper moved for partial summary judgment on the outrageous conduct claim [also known as “intentional infliction of emotional distress”]. The trial court granted the motion, determining that, although the conduct was “almost shocking to the conscience and person of anyone observing that behavior,” it did not amount to outrageous conduct under Colorado precedent.</p>
<p id="659bb9a3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Rugg. v. McCarty,</i> 476 P.2d 753 (Colo. 1970<i>)</i>, the Supreme Court recognized the tort of outrageous conduct and adopted the definition set forth in the Restatement (Second) of Torts §46: “One who by extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or recklessly causes severe emotional distress to another is subject to liability for such emotional distress, and if bodily harm to the other results from it, for such bodily harm.” Although the question whether conduct is sufficiently outrageous is ordinarily a question for the jury, the court must determine in the first instance whether reasonable persons could differ on the outrageousness issue.</p>
<p id="659bb9a4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendants argue that their actions here were no more than “mere insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, and other trivialities.” Restatement (Second) of Torts §46, Comment d. However, the defendants did not merely threaten and insult Zalnis; they took away her car and repeatedly harassed her. Conduct, otherwise permissible, may become extreme and outrageous if it is an abuse by the actor of a position in which he has actual or apparent authority over the other, or the power to affect the other’s interests. Restatement (Second) of Torts §46, Comment e; <i>See, e.g., Rugg v. McCarty, supra.</i></p>
<p id="659bb9a5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The conduct here is not a mere insistence on rights in a permissible manner. <i>See Restatement (Second) of Torts §46, Comment g</i>. Rather, the defendants’ recall of the car was to avoid a bad bargain, and accordingly, the conduct was not privileged. <i>Meiter, supra; see Enright v. Groves,</i> 560 P.2d 851 (Colo. 1977).</p>
<p id="659bb9a6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants assert that their actions must be judged by the impact they would have on an ordinary person with ordinary sensibilities. We disagree. The outrageous character of the conduct may arise from the actor’s knowledge that the other is peculiarly susceptible to emotional distress by reason of some physical or mental condition or peculiarity. Restatement (Second) of Torts §46, Comment f. In <i>Enright, supra,</i> outrageous conduct was found where a police officer effecting an illegal arrest grabbed and twisted the plaintiff’s arm even after she told him her arm was easily dislocated. In the instant case, plaintiff was peculiarly susceptible to emotional distress because she had witnessed her <span title="102" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-102">p. 102</span>husband’s suicide, and Trosper and Anthony knew about her susceptibility. Here, as in <i>Enright,</i> the defendants’ knowledge exacerbated the conduct.</p>
<p id="659bb9a7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, Zalnis has sufficiently alleged that Trosper and Anthony acted with the intent to bully her into giving up her car. In view of their knowledge of her emotional susceptibility, they could be considered to have acted intentionally or recklessly in causing her severe emotional distress.</p>
<p id="659bb9a8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendants argue that we should observe a distinction between a single outrageous occurrence and an outrageous course of conduct. While it is true that “the courts are more likely to find outrageous conduct in a series of incidents or a ‘course of conduct’ than in a single incident,” it is the totality of conduct that must be evaluated to determine whether outrageous conduct has occurred. Our evaluation of the totality of the conduct leads to the conclusion that reasonable persons could differ on the question whether there was outrageous conduct, and thus, summary judgment was improper.</p>
<p id="659bb9a9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>

<p id="659bb9ac-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Intentional or Reckless Standard.</i></b> The <i>Zalnis</i> case involves conduct alleged to have been intentional in causing severe emotional distress. In fact, as the court reads the allegations in that case, the defendants’ plan was to cause so much stress to plaintiff that she would yield to their unreasonable and non-privileged demands to undo the transaction. The court mentions in its statement of the elements that, notwithstanding the name of the cause of action, reckless infliction of emotional distress will also suffice.</p>
<p id="659be0bd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Other Causes of Action.</i></b> Sometimes the facts in a case for intentional infliction of emotional distress might permit the plaintiff to plead another tort cause of action. Considering some of the intentional tort claims already covered in this book, can you spot any such possible claims the plaintiff might have attempted in <i>Zalnis</i>? Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permits a plaintiff pleading one claim against an opposing party to plead as many other claims as the plaintiff might have at the same time.</p>

There are a lot of different people in the audience a plaintiff must convince. First, the plaintiff must get the trial judge to accept the possibility that the alleged conduct might be considered outrageous—otherwise defendant’s motion to dismiss will be granted. At trial the plaintiff must continue to convince the trial judge of the viability of the claim, or else face a motion for directed verdict. Even after doing so, the plaintiff will then have to convince a jury (in federal court by a unanimous verdict) that the conduct is outrageous. Even if the plaintiff has succeeded with each of these audiences, the plaintiff may have to convince a three-judge panel on an appellate court that the conduct might be considered outrageous.</p>
<p id="659c07e7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Other Previously Recognized Claims.</i></b> Earlier in the twentieth century, courts in most states used to recognize so-called “heart balm” torts related to <span title="105" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-105">p. 105</span>various acts of home-wrecking. For example, many states recognized a claim for “alienation of affection” or “criminal conversation” when someone seduced another’s spouse into having an affair. For various reasons, most states have decided to get out of the business of regulating the morality of such conduct and have abandoned these causes of action. Does this explain, in any way, the reluctance by the <i>Strauss</i> court to even submit the issue of outrageousness to the jury?</p>

Courts began permitting such claims by stretching certain tort doctrines. Eventually the Tennessee Supreme Court adopted the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress based upon the exacting requirements of the Restatement for proving such a claim.]</p>
<p id="659c2f07-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the brief history of the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress, this Court has not examined whether expert testimony is required to establish the existence of a serious mental injury. Other courts, however, that have examined this issue have come to markedly different conclusions.</p>
<p id="659c2f08-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A minority of jurisdictions requires expert medical or scientific proof of serious mental injury to maintain a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. <i>See</i>, e.g., <i>Kazatsky v. King David Mem’l Park, Inc.,</i> 515 Pa. 183, 527 A.2d 988 (Pa. 1987). These courts reason that expert proof is necessary to prevent the tort from being reduced to a single element of outrageousness, so by requiring expert proof, the elements of outrageous conduct and serious mental injury remain distinct. <i>See Kazatsky,</i> 527 A.2d at 995. Moreover, courts expressing the minority view contend that because expert proof can be easily obtained, it must be used to prove serious mental injury. These courts assert that due to the wide availability of expert proof, plaintiffs will encounter “little difficulty in procuring reliable testimony as to the nature and extent of their injuries.” <i>Id</i>.</p>
<p id="659c5619-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A majority of courts that have examined this issue, however, have concluded that expert proof is generally not necessary to establish the existence of a serious mental injury. The flagrant and outrageous nature of the defendant’s conduct, according to these courts, adds weight to a plaintiff’s claim and affords more assurance that the claim is serious. Moreover, expert testimony is not essential because other reliable forms of evidence, including physical manifestations of distress and subjective testimony, are available. Courts following the majority approach also contend that expert testimony is normally not necessary because a jury is generally capable of determining whether a claimant has sustained a serious mental injury as a proximate result of the intentional conduct of another person. <i>See McKnight,</i> 358 S.E.2d at 109. Additionally, courts expressing the majority view reason that the very nature of the tort of intentional <span title="107" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-107">p. 107</span>infliction of emotional distress “makes it impossible to quantify damages mainly on expert medical evidence.” <i>Chandler,</i> 741 P.2d at 867.</p>
<p id="659c561a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that the majority approach is consistent with our precedents and the underlying policies governing the law of intentional infliction of emotional distress. As previously discussed, the Court in Medlin examined and rejected arguments traditionally used to justify limiting actions for mental distress. Additionally, through our interpretation of intentional infliction of emotional distress, this Court has also rejected a second argument—the requirement of an accompanying physical injury. <i>See Medlin,</i> 398 S.W.2d at 273-74. The policy underlying development of the tort is that legitimate claims for emotional distress should be actionable and should be judged on their merits. With our decision today, we reject a third argument—the requirement of expert testimony. In so doing, we ensure that a plaintiff with a legitimate claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress will have an opportunity to seek redress for that claim, unburdened by the historical limits imposed by law.</p>
<p id="659c561b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We recognize that legitimate concerns of fraudulent and trivial claims are implicated when a plaintiff brings an action for a purely mental injury. Thus, safeguards are needed to ensure the reliability of claims for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. These safeguards, however, differ based on the kind of conduct, rather than the kind of injury, for which a plaintiff seeks a remedy.</p>
<p id="659c561c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With regard to intentional infliction of emotional distress, the added measure of reliability, <i>i.e.</i>, the insurance against frivolous claims, is found in the plaintiff’s burden to prove that the offending conduct was outrageous. This is an exacting standard requiring the plaintiff to show that the defendant’s conduct is “so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.” Restatement (Second) of Torts §46 cmt. d (1965). Such conduct is “important evidence that the distress has existed,” id. §45 cmt. j, and from such conduct, more reliable indicia of a severe mental injury may arise. The outrageous nature of the conduct, therefore, vitiates the need for expert testimony in a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The risk of frivolous litigation, then, is alleviated in claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress by the requirement that a plaintiff prove that the offending conduct was so outrageous that it is not tolerated by a civilized society.</p>
<p id="659c561d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although we adopt the majority approach and hold that plaintiffs normally will not be required to support their claims of serious mental injury by expert proof in order to recover damages in a suit based upon the intentional infliction of emotional distress, we certainly do not discredit the use of expert testimony at trial. We are fully aware that there will be many cases in which a judge or jury may not appreciate the full extent and disabling effects of a plaintiff’s emotional injury without expert evidence.</p>
<p id="659c561e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our decision today merely recognizes that in most cases other forms of proof may also be used to establish a claim for intentional infliction of <span title="108" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-108">p. 108</span>emotional distress. Such proof may include a claimant’s own testimony, <i>See Peery,</i> 897 P.2d at 1191, as well as the testimony of other lay witnesses acquainted with the claimant, <i>see Uebelacker,</i> 549 N.E.2d at 1220. Physical manifestations of emotional distress may also serve as proof of serious mental injury. Moreover, evidence that a plaintiff has suffered from nightmares, insomnia, and depression or has sought psychiatric treatment may support a claim of a serious mental injury. <i>See Medlin,</i> 398 S.W.2d at 272; <i>Johnson v. Woman’s Hosp</i>., 527 S.W.2d 133, 140 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1975). The intensity and duration of the mental distress are also factors that may be considered in determining the severity of the injury.</p>
<p id="659c561f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Such proof, however, is no guarantee that a plaintiff will prevail. The weight, faith, and credibility afforded to any witness’s testimony lies in the first instance with the trier of fact who is free to conclude that the subjective testimony of a plaintiff or other lay witnesses is not sufficient to prove a serious mental injury. Thus, although not legally required, “expert testimony may be the most effective method of demonstrating the existence of severe emotional distress.” <i>Richardson,</i> 705 P.2d at 457 n.6.</p>
<p id="659c5620-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In summary, we hold that expert medical or scientific proof of a serious mental injury is generally not required to maintain a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Accordingly, we reverse the judgments of the trial court and the Court of Appeals and remand to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>

[The U.S. Supreme Court had already decided in this case that the president had no immunity from suit despite his office. Thereafter the federal district court dismissed plaintiff’s claims for defamation and due process violations for failure to state a claim.

<p id="659ca44e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This lawsuit is based on an incident that is said to have taken place on the afternoon of May 8, 1991, in a suite at the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock, Arkansas. President Clinton was Governor of the State of Arkansas at the time, and plaintiff was a State employee with the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission (“AIDC”), having begun her State employment on March 11, 1991. Ferguson was an Arkansas State Police officer assigned to the Governor’s security detail. [Plaintiff alleged that a member of Clinton’s security detail relayed a message to her that Clinton wanted to meet her at his suite and gave her his room number.

<p id="659ca44f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff states that upon arriving at the suite and announcing herself, the Governor shook her hand, invited her in, and closed the door. She states that a few minutes of small talk ensued.…Plaintiff states that the Governor then “unexpectedly reached over to [her], took her hand, and pulled her toward him, so that their bodies were close to each other.” She states she removed her hand from his and retreated several feet, but that the Governor approached her again and, while saying, “I love the way your hair flows down your back” and “I love your curves,” put his hand on her leg, started sliding it toward her pelvic area, and bent down to attempt to kiss her on the neck, all without her consent. Plaintiff states that she exclaimed, “What are you doing?” told the Governor that she was “not that kind of girl,” and “escaped” from the Governor’s reach “by <span title="110" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-110">p. 110</span>walking away from him.” She states she was extremely upset and confused and, not knowing what to do, attempted to distract the Governor by chatting about his wife. Plaintiff states that she sat down at the end of the sofa nearest the door, but that the Governor approached the sofa where she had taken a seat and, as he sat down, “lowered his trousers and underwear, exposed his penis (which was erect) and told [her] to ‘kiss it.’” She states that she was “horrified” by this and that she “jumped up from the couch” and told the Governor that she had to go, saying something to the effect that she had to get back to the registration desk. Plaintiff states that the Governor, “while fondling his penis,” said, “Well, I don’t want to make you do anything you don’t want to do,” and then pulled up his pants and said, “If you get in trouble for leaving work, have Dave [a member of his detail] call me immediately and I’ll take care of it.” She states that as she left the room (the door of which was not locked), the Governor “detained” her momentarily, “looked sternly” at her, and said, “You are smart. Let’s keep this between ourselves.”</p>
<p id="659ca450-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff states that the Governor’s advances to her were unwelcome, that she never said or did anything to suggest to the Governor that she was willing to have sex with him, and that during the time they were together in the hotel suite, she resisted his advances although she was “stunned by them and intimidated by who he was.” She states that from that point on, she was “very fearful” that her refusal to submit to the Governor’s advances could damage her career and even jeopardize her employment.</p>
<p id="659ca451-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff voluntarily terminated her employment with AIDC on February 20, 1993, in order to move to California with her husband, who had been transferred.…Thereafter, on May 6, 1994, plaintiff filed this lawsuit.</p>
<p id="659ca452-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff’s amended complaint contains…a state law claim in which plaintiff asserts a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress or outrage against Governor Clinton, based primarily on the alleged incident at the hotel but also encompassing subsequent alleged acts.</p>
<p id="659ca453-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The President moves for summary judgment on the following grounds:…plaintiff’s claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress or outrage fails because (a) by plaintiff’s own testimony, the conduct at issue does not constitute intentional infliction of emotional distress or outrage under Arkansas law, and (b) plaintiff did not as a result of the alleged conduct suffer emotional distress so severe that no reasonable person could endure it.</p>
<p id="659ca454-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Arkansas recognizes a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress based on sexual harassment. To establish a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff must prove that: (1) the defendant intended to inflict emotional distress or knew or should have known that emotional distress was the likely result of his conduct; (2) the conduct was extreme and outrageous and utterly intolerable in a civilized community; (3) the defendant’s conduct was the cause of the plaintiff’s distress; and (4) the plaintiff’s emotional distress was so severe in nature that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it.</p>
<p id="659cca65-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The President argues that the alleged conduct of which plaintiff complains was brief and isolated; did not result in any physical harm or objective <span title="111" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-111">p. 111</span>symptoms of the requisite severe distress; did not result in distress so severe that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it; and he had no knowledge of any special condition of plaintiff that would render her particularly susceptible to distress.

The Court agrees.</p>
<p id="659cca66-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One is subject to liability for the tort of outrage or intentional infliction of emotional distress if he or she wilfully or wantonly causes severe emotional distress to another by extreme and outrageous conduct.

The tort is clearly not intended to provide legal redress for every slight insult or indignity that one must endure. <i>Manning,</i> 127 F.3d at 690 (citing <i>Hamaker,</i> 51 F.3d at 110). The Arkansas courts take a strict approach and give a narrow view to claims of outrage and merely describing conduct as outrageous does not make it so. <i>Ross,</i> 817 S.W.2d at 420.</p>
<p id="659cca67-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff seems to base her claim of outrage on her erroneous belief that the allegations she has presented are sufficient to constitute criminal sexual assault. She states that “Mr. Clinton’s outrageous conduct includes offensive language, an offensive proposition, offensive touching (constituting sexual assault under both federal and state definitions), and actual exposure of intimate private body part,” and that “there are few more outrageous acts than a criminal sexual assault followed by unwanted exposure, coupled with a demand for oral sex by the most powerful man in the state against a very young, low-level employee.”</p>
<p id="659cca68-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While the Court will certainly agree that plaintiff’s allegations describe offensive conduct, the Court, as previously noted, has found that the Governor’s alleged conduct does not constitute sexual assault. Rather, the conduct as alleged by plaintiff describes a mere sexual proposition or encounter, albeit an odious one, that was relatively brief in duration, did not involve any coercion or threats of reprisal, and was abandoned as soon as plaintiff made clear that the advance was not welcome. The Court is not aware of any authority holding that such a sexual encounter or proposition of the type alleged in this case, without more, gives rise to a claim of outrage. <i>Cf. Croom,</i> 323 Ark. 95, 913 S.W.2d 283 at 287 (use of wine and medication by a vastly older relative to foist sex on a minor cousin went “beyond a mere sexual encounter” and offended all sense of decency).</p>
<p id="659cca69-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, notwithstanding the offensive nature of the Governor’s alleged conduct, plaintiff admits that she never missed a day of work following the <span title="112" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-112">p. 112</span>alleged incident, she continued to work at AIDC another nineteen months (leaving only because of her husband’s job transfer), she continued to go on a daily basis to the Governor’s Office to deliver items and never asked to be relieved of that duty, she never filed a formal complaint or told her supervisors of the incident while at AIDC, she never consulted a psychiatrist, psychologist, or incurred medical bills as a result of the alleged incident, and she acknowledges that her two subsequent contacts with the Governor involved comments made “in a light vein” and nonsexual contact that was done in a “friendly fashion.” Further, despite earlier claiming that she suffered marital discord and humiliation, plaintiff stated in her deposition that she was not claiming damages to her marriage as a result of the Governor’s alleged conduct.…Plaintiff’s actions and statements in this case do not portray someone who experienced emotional distress so severe in nature that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it.</p>
<p id="659cca6a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, plaintiff’s allegations fall far short of the rigorous standards for establishing a claim of outrage under Arkansas law and the Court therefore grants the President’s motion for summary judgment on this claim.</p>

To recognize this new tort when other claims are unavailing might undermine the law in those other areas. The court in <i>Clinton</i> already determined that the plaintiff did not have a good cause of action for employment discrimination. How might this impact the court’s view of the plaintiff’s ability to state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress?</p>
<p id="659cca6e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>The Rest of the Story.</i></b> While the above case was still pending, plaintiff’s counsel took President Clinton’s deposition and inquired about other alleged sexual affairs involving other women. He was asked, famously, whether he “ever had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky…?” President Clinton denied any such activities. When a witness named Linda Tripp provided tangible evidence (in the form of a stained blue dress) of such a possible relationship, charges of perjury were drawn up and this led to the House of Representatives voting to impeach the President. The Republican-controlled Senate was never able to garner the required two-thirds votes to convict, with only 45 senators voting guilty on the charges. Despite the dismissal of the above case on summary judgment, President Clinton later agreed to a monetary payment to the plaintiff in exchange for her agreement to drop her possible appeal of this summary judgment order. If nothing else, the <i>Clinton</i> case demonstrates that even <span title="113" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-113">p. 113</span>scandalous activity may not clear the high hurdles courts have established for maintaining a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>

To recover, plaintiff must establish the following elements:</p>
<p id="659cf188-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant acted intentionally or recklessly. For an intentional act to result in liability, the defendant must intend both to do the act and to produce emotional distress. For a reckless act to result in liability, a defendant must act in deliberate disregard of a high degree of probability that emotional distress will follow.</p>
<p id="659d1899-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the defendant’s conduct must be extreme and outrageous. The conduct must be so outrageous in character and so extreme in degree as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency and to be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community. The liability clearly does not extend to mere insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions or other trivialities.</p>
<p id="659d189a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, the defendant’s actions must have been the proximate cause of plaintiff’s emotional distress.</p>
<p id="659d189b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fourth, the emotional distress suffered by plaintiff must be so severe that no reasonable person could be expected to endure such distress. Defendant’s conduct must be sufficiently severe to cause genuine and substantial emotional distress or mental harm to the average person. This average person must be one similarly situated to the plaintiff. The plaintiff cannot recover for his/her emotional distress if that emotional distress would not have been experienced by an average person.</p></div>

<p id="659d189e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Where a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress relies primarily upon a form of speech to demonstrate the requisite outrageous conduct, there arises the potential that a court’s entry of a judgment for damages against the defendant could be viewed as an unconstitutional restriction on free speech. In Chapter 12 we will see courts having significant concerns with the application of the law of defamation to the First Amendment’s protection of freedom of speech. The United States Supreme Court has been sensitive to balancing a state’s legitimate interest in providing remedies for victims of torts, while not permitting such civil actions to unduly infringe a citizen’s right to express even “outrageous” views. Consider how the Supreme Court in the recent <i>Snyder</i> case has attempted to strike this balance in the context of a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress against a church engaging in what many consider to be highly offensive speech-based conduct.</p>

<p id="659d18a4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A jury held members of the Westboro Baptist Church liable for millions of dollars in damages for picketing near a soldier’s funeral service. The picket signs reflected the church’s view that the United States is overly tolerant of sin and that God kills American soldiers as punishment. The question presented is whether the First Amendment shields the church members from tort liability for their speech in this case.</p>
<p id="659d18a5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fred Phelps founded the Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas, in 1955. The church’s congregation believes that God hates and punishes the United States for its tolerance of homosexuality, particularly in America’s military. The church frequently communicates its views by picketing, often at military funerals. In the more than 20 years that the members of Westboro Baptist have publicized their message, they have picketed nearly 600 funerals. Marine Lance Corporal Matthew Snyder was killed in Iraq in the line of duty. Lance Corporal Snyder’s father selected the Catholic church in the Snyders’ hometown of Westminster, Maryland, as the site for his son’s funeral. Local newspapers provided notice of the time and location of the service.</p>

On the day of the memorial service, the Westboro congregation members picketed on public land adjacent to public streets near the Maryland State House, the United States Naval Academy, and Matthew Snyder’s funeral. The Westboro picketers carried signs that were largely the same at all three locations. They stated, for instance: “God Hates the USA/Thank God for 9/11,” “America is Doomed,” “Don’t Pray for the USA,” “Thank God <span title="115" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-115">p. 115</span>for IEDs,” “Thank God for Dead Soldiers,” “Pope in Hell,” “Priests Rape Boys,” “God Hates Fags,” “You’re Going to Hell,” and “God Hates You.”</p>
<p id="659d3fb9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The church had notified the authorities in advance of its intent to picket at the time of the funeral, and the picketers complied with police instructions in staging their demonstration. The picketing took place within a 10-by-25-foot plot of public land adjacent to a public street, behind a temporary fence. That plot was approximately 1,000 feet from the church where the funeral was held. Several buildings separated the picket site from the church. The Westboro picketers displayed their signs for about 30 minutes before the funeral began and sang hymns and recited Bible verses. None of the picketers entered church property or went to the cemetery. They did not yell or use profanity, and there was no violence associated with the picketing.</p>
<p id="659d3fba-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The funeral procession passed within 200 to 300 feet of the picket site. Although Snyder testified that he could see the tops of the picket signs as he drove to the funeral, he did not see what was written on the signs until later that night, while watching a news broadcast covering the event.</p>
<p id="659d3fbb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Snyder filed suit against Phelps, Phelps’s daughters, and the Westboro Baptist Church (collectively Westboro or the church) in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland under that court’s diversity jurisdiction. Snyder alleged…intentional infliction of emotional distress. Westboro moved for summary judgment contending, in part, that the church’s speech was insulated from liability by the First Amendment.</p>
<p id="659d3fbc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To succeed on a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress in Maryland, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant intentionally or <span title="116" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-116">p. 116</span>recklessly engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct that caused the plaintiff to suffer severe emotional distress. <i>See Harris v. Jones,</i> 380 A.2d 611, 614 (Md. 1977). The Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment—“Congress shall make no law…abridging the freedom of speech”—can serve as a defense in state tort suits, including suits for intentional infliction of emotional distress. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g., Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell,</i> 485 U.S. 46, 50-51 (1988).</p>
<p id="659d3fbd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether the First Amendment prohibits holding Westboro liable for its speech in this case turns largely on whether that speech is of public or private concern, as determined by all the circumstances of the case. “[S]peech on ‘matters of public concern’…is ‘at the heart of the First Amendment’s protection.’” <i>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc.,</i> 472 U.S. 749, 758-759 (1985) (opinion of Powell, J.). The First Amendment reflects “a profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.” <i>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,</i> 376 U.S. 254, 270 (1964). That is because “speech concerning public affairs is more than self-expression; it is the essence of self-government.” <i>Garrison v. Louisiana,</i> 379 U.S. 64, 74-75 (1964). Accordingly, “speech on public issues occupies the highest rung of the hierarchy of First Amendment values, and is entitled to special protection.” <i>Connick v. Myers,</i> 461 U.S. 138 (1983). “[N]ot all speech is of equal First Amendment importance,” however, and where matters of purely private significance are at issue, First Amendment protections are often less rigorous. <i>Hustler, supra,</i> at 56.</p>
<p id="659d3fbe-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We noted a short time ago, in considering whether public employee speech addressed a matter of public concern, that “the boundaries of the public concern test are not well defined.” <i>San Diego v. Roe,</i> 543 U.S. 77, 83 (2004) (<i>per curiam</i>). Although that remains true today, we have articulated some guiding principles, principles that accord broad protection to speech to ensure that courts themselves do not become inadvertent censors.</p>
<p id="659d3fbf-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Speech deals with matters of public concern when it can “be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community,” <i>Connick</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 146, or when it “is a subject of legitimate news interest; that is, a subject of general interest and of value and concern to the public,” <i>San Diego, supra,</i> at 83-84. The arguably “inappropriate or controversial character of a statement is irrelevant to the question whether it deals with a matter of public concern.” <i>Rankin v. McPherson,</i> 483 U.S. 378, 387 (1987).</p>

<p id="659d66d3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our opinion in <i>Dun &amp; Bradstreet,</i> on the other hand, provides an example of speech of only private concern. In that case we held, as a general matter, that information about a particular individual’s credit report “concerns no public issue.” 472 U.S., at 762. The content of the report, we explained, “was speech solely in the individual interest of the speaker and its specific business audience.” <i>Ibid.</i> That was confirmed by the fact that the particular report was sent to only five subscribers to the reporting service, who were bound not to disseminate it further. <i>Ibid.</i></p>
<span title="117" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-117">p. 117</span>
<p id="659d66d4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Deciding whether speech is of public or private concern requires us to examine the “content, form, and context” of that speech, “as revealed by the whole record.” <i>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, supra,</i> at 761. As in other First Amendment cases, the court is obligated “to ‘make an independent examination of the whole record’ in order to make sure that ‘the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.’” <i>Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc.,</i> 466 U.S. 485, 499.</p>
<p id="659d66d5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The “content” of Westboro’s signs plainly relates to broad issues of interest to society at large, rather than matters of “purely private concern.” <i>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, supra,</i> at 759, 105 S.Ct. 2939. The placards read “God Hates the USA/Thank God for 9/11,” “America is Doomed,” “Don’t Pray for the USA,” “Thank God for IEDs,” “Fag Troops,” “Semper Fi Fags,” “God Hates Fags,” “Maryland Taliban,” “Fags Doom Nations,” “Not Blessed Just Cursed,” “Thank God for Dead Soldiers,” “Pope in Hell,” “Priests Rape Boys,” “You’re Going to Hell,” and “God Hates You.” While these messages may fall short of refined social or political commentary, the issues they highlight—the political and moral conduct of the United States and its citizens, the fate of our Nation, homosexuality in the military, and scandals involving the Catholic clergy—are matters of public import. The signs certainly convey Westboro’s position on those issues, in a manner designed, unlike the private speech in <i>Dun &amp; Bradstreet,</i> to reach as broad a public audience as possible. And even if a few of the signs—such as “You’re Going to Hell” and “God Hates You”—were viewed as containing messages related to Matthew Snyder or the Snyders specifically, that would not change the fact that the overall thrust and dominant theme of Westboro’s demonstration spoke to broader public issues.</p>
<p id="659d66d6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Apart from the content of Westboro’s signs, Snyder contends that the “context” of the speech—its connection with his son’s funeral—makes the speech a matter of private rather than public concern. The fact that Westboro spoke in connection with a funeral, however, cannot by itself transform the nature of Westboro’s speech. Westboro’s signs, displayed on public land next to a public street, reflect the fact that the church finds much to condemn in modern society. Its speech is “fairly characterized as constituting speech on a matter of public concern,” <i>Connick,</i> 461 U.S., at 146, and the funeral setting does not alter that conclusion.</p>
<p id="659d66d7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Westboro believes that America is morally flawed; many Americans might feel the same about Westboro. Westboro’s funeral picketing is certainly hurtful and its contribution to public discourse may be negligible. But Westboro addressed matters of public import on public property, in a peaceful manner, in full compliance with the guidance of local officials. The speech was indeed planned to coincide with Matthew Snyder’s funeral, but did not itself disrupt that funeral, and Westboro’s choice to conduct its picketing at that time and place did not alter the nature of its speech.</p>
<p id="659d66d8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Speech is powerful. It can stir people to action, move them to tears of both joy and sorrow, and—as it did here—inflict great pain. On the facts before us, we cannot react to that pain by punishing the speaker. As a Nation we have chosen a different course—to protect even hurtful speech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle public debate. That choice requires that we shield Westboro from tort liability for its picketing in this case.</p>

<p id="659d8df0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Other intentional tort claims we have studied are designed to protect people’s mental and emotional states. The tort of assault is complete, so the courts say, upon the “touching of the mind.” The tort of false imprisonment fundamentally is designed to protect our sense of personal freedom to move. Significant harm may occur without any physical injury with such a claim. Even a battery cause of action will often provide for recovery of emotional distress or pain and suffering damages. But intentional infliction of emotional distress is a unique tort because its primary focus is upon emotional and mental tranquility upset by a potentially infinite variety of different types of outrageous conduct. In this sense it is the broadest applicable claim designed primarily to protect our mental peace. Though it is so broad and flexible, rigorous prerequisites have been established before it will arise: (1) mere carelessness will not suffice, as the defendant must either intend or be reckless about causing emotional distress; (2) perhaps the highest hurdle is the requirement that the defendant’s conduct in bringing about the distress be labeled “outrageous” or “utterly intolerable in a civilized society”; and (3) the requirement that the plaintiff’s emotional distress be “severe”; that is, qualitatively greater than anyone should have to endure, and long-lasting rather than fleeting.</p>

<p id="659db505-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Sara and Dennis are fellow first-year law students and bitter academic rivals. Each one believes that they are the smarter, more promising lawyer than the other. One day in class while Sara is on her feet being questioned by the professor about the <i>Palsgraf</i> case, Dennis starts blurting out the correct answers to the professor’s questions when Sara hesitates—Sara is horribly embarrassed by this conduct, feeling humiliated by what Dennis has done in front of her fellow students. (As it turns out, she cried the entire way home.) As she leaves the room, she puts her hand on Dennis’ shoulder and says “you’ll wish you never did this to me!”</p>
<p id="659db506-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That night, Dennis thinks about Sara’s statement and decides that he should do something else to interrupt Sara’s obsessive outlining of Torts. He plans to park near her house in the middle of the night and start honking his horn to wake her up, hoping she will be too tired the next day to do any outlining. Shortly after midnight, Dennis pulls up in his car and parks in the driveway of a house owned by Carlos, who lives directly across the street from Sara (Dennis thought he was in Sara’s driveway, but was confused about Sara’s address). After about thirty seconds of Dennis honking his horn, Carlos becomes outraged at the incessant honking, and, to make Dennis stop and leave, fires his shotgun toward Dennis, who is seated inside his car. Some shot from the gun impacts the car, but misses Dennis. Other shot from the shotgun goes past the car, across the street, and into Sara’s living room window and her bedroom window. Some of the shot demolished her new high definition television. Other shot hit Sara in her leg causing significant medical injuries. She tries to get up out of bed but is unable to do so because of her injuries. She is forced to remain in bed until the next day when her housekeeper arrives inside her home and discovers Sara lying in bed hurt. Dennis subsequently scores the highest grade on the Torts exam.</p>

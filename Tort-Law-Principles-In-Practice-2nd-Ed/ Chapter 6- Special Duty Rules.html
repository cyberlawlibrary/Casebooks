<p id="65cba2c4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Thus far, we have been assuming that there is always a duty of reasonable care. We spent time reviewing the character traits of the reasonable person, to what extent this reasonable person took on certain attributes of the actor in question, and how the circumstances of the accident were factored into the analysis. All the while, we have implicitly assumed that a duty of reasonable care existed. This chapter will reexamine that assumption, because it turns out that such a duty is not nearly as omnipresent as this assumption. We will begin with the traditional dichotomy between a person’s acts and a person’s omissions. This will create certain default positions on the issue of the existence of a duty. We will also cover exceptions to such default positions. Beyond that, this chapter will address certain recurring factual situations where tort law has determined whether, and to what extent, a particular duty of care will exist. Often the circumstance of special relationships among the parties, the nature of the activity, the nature of the harm, and the status of the victim and the defendant actor influence this determination. Not only will you become familiar with these special duty rules, but you will also gain some insight into how courts go about fashioning these rules of law.</p>

<p id="65cba2c7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">A very fundamental proposition in negligence law is the presumption that when we act we have to act with reasonable care. Implicit within this black letter law is the rather startling corollary that we do not generally have an obligation to act, even though refusing to come to the aid of an imperiled person may seem most unreasonable and uncivilized, if not downright monstrous. If this bothers you, you can take some comfort in the fact that tort law does impose a general duty of care on all of us to take reasonable care when we do choose to undertake some activity. When we drive a car we must do so carefully. When we go hunting we must exercise care. When we mow our lawn the obligation to act with care is established. But failing to drive our car, or mow our lawn, or go hunting does not generally make us negligent regardless of the circumstances. If we do not have an obligation to rescue others, we will see that when we do undertake to lend a hand, we are obligated to act with reasonable care. A related doctrine, however, establishes that if an actor has caused a situation of peril for another and we inject ourselves into the perilous situation as a rescuer, the law also imposes the same duty of care on that original actor toward us—the <i>rescue doctrine</i>. After exploring the parameters of the right to remain inactive, and the obligation to exercise care when acting, we will delve into the rescue doctrine and a special no-duty rule that often precludes public emergency actors from suing to recover for their own injuries during a rescue.</p>

This fundamental rule of law is something many law students find shocking. The <i>Lawter</i> decision immediately thereafter illustrates the limits of this no-duty rule. Finally, in <i>Lundy</i>, we will begin to see some cracks in the wall of this legal dichotomy. As it turns out, when some special relationship exists between the parties, the <i>Yania</i> rule of law is modified to create a duty of care otherwise absent.</p>

<p id="65cbc9e3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A bizarre and most unusual circumstance provides the background of this appeal.</p>
<p id="65cbc9e4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On September 25, 1957 John E. Bigan was engaged in a coal strip-mining operation in Shade Township, Somerset County. On the property being stripped were large cuts or trenches created by Bigan when he removed the earthen overburden for the purpose of removing the coal underneath. One cut contained water 8 to 10 feet in depth with side walls or embankments 16 to 18 feet in height; at this cut Bigan had installed a pump to remove the water.</p>
<p id="65cbc9e5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At approximately 4 p.m. on that date, Joseph F. Yania, the operator of another coal strip-mining operation, and one Boyd M. Ross went upon Bigan’s property for the purpose of discussing a business matter with Bigan, and, while there, were asked by Bigan to aid him in starting the pump. Ross and Bigan entered the cut and stood at the point where the pump was located. Yania stood at the top of one of the cut’s side walls and then jumped from the side wall—a height of 16 to 18 feet—into the water and was drowned.</p>
<p id="65cbf0f6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yania’s widow, in her own right and on behalf of her three children, instituted wrongful death and survival actions against Bigan contending Bigan was responsible for Yania’s death. [Bigan demurred to the complaint and the trial court dismissed the complaint. Plaintiff has appealed this dismissal.]</p>
<p id="65cbf0f7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Summarized, Bigan stands charged with three-fold negligence: (1) by urging, enticing, taunting and inveigling Yania to jump into the water; (2) by failing to warn Yania of a dangerous condition on the land, i.e., the cut wherein lay 8 to 10 feet of water; (3) by failing to go to Yania’s rescue after he had jumped into the water.</p>
<p id="65cbf0f8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our inquiry must be to ascertain whether the well-pleaded facts in the complaint, assumedly true, would, if shown, suffice to prove negligent conduct on the part of Bigan.</p>
<p id="65cbf0f9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant initially contends that Yania’s descent from the high embankment into the water and the resulting death were caused “entirely” by the spoken words and blandishments of Bigan delivered at a distance from Yania. The complaint does not allege that Yania slipped or that he was pushed or that Bigan made any <i>physical</i> impact upon Yania. On the contrary, the only inference deducible from the facts alleged in the complaint is that Bigan, by the employment of cajolery and inveiglement, caused such a <i>mental</i> impact on Yania that the latter was deprived of his volition and freedom of choice and placed under a compulsion to jump into the water. Had Yania been a child of tender years or a person mentally deficient then it is conceivable that taunting and enticement could constitute actionable negligence if it resulted in harm. However to contend that such conduct directed to an adult in full possession of all his mental <span title="308" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-308">p. 308</span>faculties constitutes actionable negligence is not only without precedent but completely without merit.</p>

<p id="65cbf0fe-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>only</i> condition on Bigan’s land which could possibly have contributed in any manner to Yania’s death was the water-filled cut with its high embankment. Of this condition there was neither concealment nor failure to warn, but, on the contrary, the complaint specifically avers that Bigan not only requested Yania and Boyd to assist him in starting the pump to remove the water from the cut but “led” them to the cut itself. If this cut possessed any potentiality of danger, such a condition was as obvious and apparent to Yania as to Bigan, both coal strip-mine operators. Under the circumstances herein depicted Bigan could not be held liable in this respect.</p>
<p id="65cbf0ff-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lastly, it is urged that Bigan failed to take the necessary steps to rescue Yania from the water. The mere fact that Bigan saw Yania in a position of peril in the water imposed upon him no legal, although a moral, obligation or duty to go to his rescue unless Bigan was legally responsible, in whole or in part, for placing Yania in the perilous position: Restatement, Torts, §314. Cf: Restatement, Torts, §322. The language of this Court in <i>Brown v. French</i>, 104 Pa. 604, 607, 608, is apt:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65cbf100-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If it appeared that the deceased, by his own carelessness, contributed in any degree to the accident which caused the loss of his life, the defendants ought not to have been held to answer for the consequences resulting from that accident.…He voluntarily placed himself in the way of danger, and his death was the result of his own act.…That his undertaking was an exceedingly reckless and dangerous one, the event proves, but there was no one to blame for it but himself. He had the right to try the experiment, obviously dangerous as it was, but then also upon him rested the consequences of that experiment, and upon no one else; he may have been, and probably was, ignorant of the risk which he was taking upon himself, or knowing it, and trusting to his own skill, he may have regarded it as easily superable. But in either case, the result of his ignorance, or of his mistake, must rest with himself—and cannot be charged to the defendants.</p></div>
<p id="65cbf101-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The complaint does not aver any facts which impose upon Bigan legal responsibility for placing Yania in the dangerous position in the water and, absent such legal responsibility, the law imposes on Bigan no duty of rescue.</p>
<p id="65cc1812-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recognizing that the deceased Yania is entitled to the benefit of the presumption that he was exercising due care and extending to appellant the benefit of every well pleaded fact in this complaint and the fair inferences arising therefrom, yet we can reach but one conclusion: that Yania, a reasonable and prudent adult in full possession of all his mental faculties, undertook to perform an act which he knew or should have known was attended with more or less peril and it was the performance of that act and not any conduct upon Bigan’s part which caused his unfortunate death.</p>

<p id="65cc181c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[On April 18, 1953, the deceased, Loretta Jean Lawter, her husband Oren Lawter, his brother Andrew Lawter and his wife, Susan Lawter, were in a 16-foot skiff in Biscayne Bay, when a wave drowned out the outboard motor attached to the skiff and further waves resulted in the swamping of the boat. As a result, the four passengers were cast into water approximately 500 yards from the nearest shore. The water at that particular point was approximately four feet deep.</p>
<p id="65cc181d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At this time a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter was making a routine patrol flight over the Biscayne Bay area. The flight by the helicopter was made for the purpose of determining if any vessels or people in the area were in the need of aid or assistance, so that such aid or assistance could be rendered before darkness set in. The crew of the helicopter included some who had experience and training in sea rescues and some completely lacking any such experience or training. The crew spotted the four Lawters in the water. There were no boats or vessels nearby to rescue them and so the crew of the helicopter proceeded to undertake the rescue. The helicopter was equipped with a cable used to raise someone from the sea. It was supposed to be secured to any rescued person prior to being lifted into the helicopter. On this occasion, an inexperienced member of the crew took charge of this rescue. The cable was lowered to the decedent but not secured to her. She merely had a hold of it with her hands. Before any crewmember could secure her, the inexperienced crewmember began hoisting her into the air toward the helicopter. She was raised until her head and shoulders were above the bottom of the door in the helicopter, when the cable was stopped. Deceased had not been raised high enough to be brought into the cabin.

While he survived, Lundy was left with permanent disabilities. Lundy and his wife here appeal from a summary judgment entered against them by the district court. Their appeal raises [the issue of] what duty, if any, did TropWorld owe under New Jersey law to provide medical care to Lundy.</p>
<p id="65cc3f3b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The district court held that TropWorld’s duty is, at most, to provide basic first aid to the patron when the need becomes apparent and to take reasonable steps to procure appropriate medical care. Because the court found no evidence that TropWorld was negligent in carrying out this duty to Lundy, it granted TropWorld’s motion for summary judgment. We will affirm.</p>
<p id="65cc3f3c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On August 3, 1989, Lundy, a 66-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, was patronizing TropWorld Casino. While Lundy was gambling at a blackjack table, he suffered cardiac arrest and fell to the ground unconscious. Three other patrons quickly ran to Lundy and began to assist him. The first to reach him was Essie Greenberg (“Ms. Greenberg”), a critical care nurse. Ms. Greenberg was soon joined by her husband, Dr. Martin Greenberg (“Dr. Greenberg”), who is a pulmonary specialist. The third individual who aided Lundy did not disclose his identity, but he indicated to Dr. Greenberg that he was a surgeon. During his deposition, Dr. Greenberg stated that, when he first arrived on the scene, Lundy was unresponsive, not breathing, and without a pulse. Dr. Greenberg testified that he, his wife, and the surgeon immediately began to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (“CPR”) on Lundy.</p>
<p id="65cc664d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Meanwhile, the blackjack dealer at the table where Lundy had been gambling pushed an emergency “call” button at his table which alerted TropWorld’s Security Command Post that a problem existed.</p>
<span title="311" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-311">p. 311</span>
<p id="65cc664e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A sergeant in TropWorld’s security force and a TropWorld security guard arrived at the blackjack table apparently within fifteen seconds of their receiving the radio message from the Security Command Post. The Greenbergs and the unidentified surgeon were already assisting Lundy. Upon arriving, the security guard called the Security Command Post on her hand-held radio and requested that someone contact the casino medical station, which was located one floor above the casino. Several witnesses agree that Nurse Margaret Slusher (“Nurse Slusher”), the nurse who was on-duty at the casino medical station at the time, arrived on the scene within a minute or two of being summoned. As soon as Nurse Slusher arrived, she instructed the security guards to call for an ambulance.</p>
<p id="65cc664f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nurse Slusher brought with her an ambu-bag, oxygen, and an airway. She did not, however, bring an intubation kit to the scene. Dr. Greenberg testified that he asked Nurse Slusher for one and she told him that it was TropWorld’s “policy” not to have an intubation kit on the premises. Nurse Slusher testified at her deposition that some of the equipment normally found in an intubation kit was stocked in TropWorld’s medical center, but that she did not bring this equipment with her because she was not qualified to use it.</p>
<p id="65cc6650-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nurse Slusher proceeded to assist the three patrons in performing CPR on Lundy. Specifically, Nurse Slusher placed the ambu-bag over Lundy’s face while the others took turns doing chest compressions. The ambu-bag was connected to an oxygen source. Dr. Greenberg testified that he was sure that air was entering Lundy’s respiratory system and that Lundy was being adequately oxygenated during the period when he was receiving both CPR treatment and air through the ambu-bag. Dr. Greenberg went on to say that the only reason he had requested an intubation kit was “to establish an airway and subsequently provide oxygen in a more efficient manner.”</p>
<p id="65cc6651-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Upon the arrival of the EMT unit, a technician, with the help of the two doctor patrons, attempted to intubate Lundy using an intubation kit brought by the EMT unit. Dr. Greenberg claimed that, due to Lundy’s stout physique and rigid muscle tone, it was a very difficult intubation, and that there were at least a half dozen failed attempts before the procedure was successfully completed. After intubation, Lundy regained a pulse and his color improved.</p>
<p id="65cc6652-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[By way of granting a summary judgment motion, the] district court held that TropWorld had fulfilled its duty to Lundy under New Jersey law. The court found that TropWorld had “immediately summoned medical attention for Mr. Lundy once it became aware of his need for it.” Additionally, the court stated that [TropWorld] “fulfilled its duty to aid injured patrons by having at least a registered nurse available, trained in emergency care, who could immediately size up a patron’s medical situation and summon appropriate emergency medical personnel and equipment by ambulance to respond to the patrons’s (sic) emergency needs.”</p>
<p id="65cc6653-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Additionally, the court held that New Jersey’s Good Samaritan Statute, <i>N.J. Stat. Ann. §2A:62A-1</i> (West 1993), shielded TropWorld and its employees from liability for any acts or omissions they took while rendering care in good faith to Lundy.</p>
<span title="312" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-312">p. 312</span>
<p id="65cc6654-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Lundys cannot, and do not, claim that TropWorld was responsible in any way for Mr. Lundy’s medical emergency. Rather, as we understand it, the Lundys advance two theories of liability against TropWorld. First, the relationship between a casino and its patrons gives rise to a duty to provide medical care, and TropWorld breached this duty when it failed to have on-site the equipment and skilled personnel necessary to perform an intubation. Second, TropWorld breached a voluntarily assumed duty by failing to provide Dr. Greenberg, upon his request, with the laryngoscope with intubation tube that was available in the medical station.</p>
<p id="65cc6655-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Generally, a bystander has no duty to provide affirmative aid to an injured person, even if the bystander has the ability to help. <i>See</i> W. Page Keeton et al., <i>Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts §56</i>, at 375 (5th ed. 1984). New Jersey courts have recognized, however, that the existence of a relationship between the victim and one in a position to render aid may create a duty to render assistance. In <i>Szabo v. Pennsylvania R.R. Co.</i>, 132 N.J.L. 331, 40 A.2d 562 (N.J. Err. &amp; App. 1945), for example, New Jersey’s highest court held that [if an employee,] while engaged in the work of his or her employer, sustains an injury rendering him or her helpless to provide for his or her own care, the employer must secure medical care for the employee. If a casino owner in New Jersey owes no greater duty to its patrons than an employer owes its employees while they are engaged in the employer’s business, we think it clear that TropWorld did not fail in its duty to render assistance.</p>
<p id="65cc6656-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Lundys insist, however, that TropWorld had a duty beyond that recognized in <i>Szabo</i>. They urge specifically that the Supreme Court of New Jersey would adopt the rule set forth in the <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts §314A</i> (1965). <i>Section 314A</i> states in pertinent part:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65cc6657-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(1) A common carrier is under a duty to its passengers to take reasonable action</p>

<p id="65cc8d6c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think it likely that the Supreme Court of New Jersey would accept the principles enunciated in <i>§314A</i> and would apply them in a case involving a casino and one of its patrons. The pertinent commentary following <i>§314A</i> indicates that the duty “to take reasonable action…to give…first aid” in times of emergency requires only that carriers, innkeepers and landowners procure appropriate medical care as soon as the need for such care becomes apparent and provide such first aid prior to the arrival of qualified assistance as the carrier’s, innkeeper’s or landowner’s employees are reasonably capable of giving. Clearly, the duty recognized in <i>§314A</i> does not extend to providing all medical <span title="313" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-313">p. 313</span>care that the carrier or innkeeper could reasonably foresee might be needed by a patron. Specifically, the commentary states:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65cc8d6d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">f. The defendant…in the case of an ill or injured person…will seldom be required to do more than give such first aid as he reasonably can, and take reasonable steps to turn the sick man over to a physician, or to those who will look after him and see that medical assistance is obtained.</p></div>
<p id="65cc8d6e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nurse Slusher was a registered, licensed nurse who had been trained in emergency care and who had fifteen years of nursing experience. The uncontradicted evidence was that, despite this training and experience, she was not competent to perform an intubation. It necessarily follows that the duty which the Lundys insist the New Jersey Supreme Court would recognize in this case would require casinos to provide a full-time on-site staff physician. Certainly, maintaining on a full-time basis the capability of performing an intubation goes far beyond any “first aid” contemplated by <i>§314A</i>. We are confident the New Jersey Supreme Court would decline to impose liability on TropWorld for failing to maintain that full-time capability.</p>
<p id="65cc8d6f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Lundys further claim that, even if there would otherwise be no duty to provide a level of care encompassing intubation, TropWorld voluntarily assumed a duty to provide such care and breached that duty by negligently failing to provide it. As we understand the argument, TropWorld voluntarily assumed this duty in two ways. First, by [having] a laryngoscope with intubation tube on the premises, TropWorld voluntarily assumed the duty of having it available for use on request. Second, by voluntarily undertaking to assist Mr. Lundy, TropWorld assumed a duty to use due care in providing that assistance and breached this duty when Nurse Slusher failed to bring the laryngoscope with intubation tube to Dr. Greenberg. In connection with this second argument, the Lundys rely upon the principles outlined in <i>§324 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> which provides:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65cc8d70-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One who, being under no duty to do so, takes charge of another who is helpless adequately to aid or protect himself is subject to liability to the other for any bodily harm caused to him by</p>
<p id="65cc8d71-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(a) the failure of the actor to exercise reasonable care to secure the safety of the other while within the actor’s charge, or</p>
<p id="65cc8d72-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(b) the actor’s discontinuing his aid or protection, if by so doing he leaves the other in a worse position than when the actor took charge of him.</p>
</div>
<p id="65cc8d73-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As we have indicated, TropWorld’s medical center, did have a laryngoscope with intubation tube as part of its inventory of equipment. Nurse Slusher did not bring this equipment with her when she was summoned to Pit 3, however. She brought only that equipment that she was qualified to use: the ambu-bag, oxygen, and an airway. At some point after her arrival on the scene, Dr. Greenberg asked for an intubation kit. While the Lundys do not expressly so state, we <span title="314" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-314">p. 314</span>understand their contention to be that Nurse Slusher should have returned to the medical center at this point and retrieved the intubation tube for Dr. Greenberg’s use and TropWorld is liable for her failure to do so. They suggest that her failure to do so was the result of an ill-considered TropWorld policy that she was not permitted to use intubation equipment.</p>
<p id="65cc8d74-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We reject the notion that TropWorld voluntarily assumed a duty to Mr. Lundy it would not otherwise have had. The Lundys have referred us to no New Jersey case law supporting this proposition and we have found none.</p>
<p id="65cc8d75-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Lundys’ argument based on <i>§324 of the Restatement</i>, ignores the fact that the principles restated therein have been materially altered by New Jersey’s Good Samaritan Act, <i>§2A: 62A-1 N.J. Stat. Ann.</i> That Act provides that anyone “who in good faith renders emergency aid at the scene of an…emergency to the victim…shall not be liable for any civil damages as a result of acts or omissions by such person in rendering the emergency care.” We believe the Supreme Court of New Jersey would hold that this mandate protects TropWorld from liability in the situation before us.</p>
<p id="65ccb486-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Lundys do not, and cannot, assert that there was bad faith here. Rather, they seek to avoid the effect of New Jersey’s Good Samaritan Act by relying on what is known as the “preexisting duty” exception to the Act. Under this exception, the Act provides no immunity from liability if the duty allegedly breached by the volunteer was a duty that existed prior to the voluntary activity. <i>E.g.</i>, <i>Praet v. Borough of Sayreville, 218 N.J. Super.</i> 218, 527 A.2d 486 (1987) (police officers who have a preexisting duty to render emergency assistance to a motorist trapped in a car may be held liable for failing to extricate motorist and prevent fire). We do not believe the preexisting duty exception is applicable under New Jersey law in a situation, like the present one, where the preexisting duty is a limited one and the alleged negligence is the failure to provide a level of assistance beyond that required by the preexisting duty.</p>
<p id="65ccb487-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think this becomes apparent when one focuses on the purposes of the Good Samaritan Act and the preexisting duty exception and on the nature of the preexisting duty in this case. The purpose of the Good Samaritan Act is to encourage the rendering of assistance to victims by providing that the voluntary rendering of aid will not give rise to any liability that would not otherwise exist. The preexisting duty exception recognizes that fulfillment of this objective of the statute can be accomplished without the eradication of preexisting duties.</p>
<p id="65ccb488-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nurse Slusher had no preexisting duty to Lundy apart from her role as an employee of TropWorld. Nurse Slusher, if she had been a fellow patron, for example, would have had no preexisting duty obligation and she would have been fully protected by the Good Samaritan Act. Thus, the only relevant preexisting duty for purposes of applying the Act under New Jersey law is the preexisting duty owed by TropWorld to Mr. Lundy. That preexisting duty, as we have seen, was a duty limited to summoning aid and, in the interim, taking reasonable first aid measures. It did not include the duty to provide the medical equipment and personnel necessary to perform an intubation. It follows, we believe, that Nurse Slusher’s conduct with respect to the providing or <span title="315" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-315">p. 315</span>withholding of the intubation equipment on the premises was not conduct with respect to which she or TropWorld owed a preexisting duty to Lundy. It further follows that, if TropWorld is responsible for the assistance voluntarily provided by Nurse Slusher, it is protected by the Act from liability arising from her alleged negligence in failing to provide that intubation equipment. Accordingly, we conclude that TropWorld’s motion for summary judgment was properly granted.</p>

<div class="epub-heading cc-font-xlarge left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="65ccb48a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b">NOTES AND PROBLEMS</p></h3></div>
<p id="65ccb48b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Acts vs. Omissions</i>.</b> Why does the common law make this distinction between acts and failures to act? Judge Cardozo in <i>Palsgraf</i> argued that the foreseeable orbit of danger set the contours for the duty of care. Wasn’t the plaintiff in <i>Yania</i> (who drowned after jumping into the water) in foreseeable danger? Did Dr. Greenberg, in <i>Lundy</i>, have any common law obligation to come to the assistance of the ill gambler? Regardless of how slight (or reasonable) the burden might be on a bystander to come to the rescue of another, and despite how foreseeable (perhaps inevitable) the harm might be from inaction, the common law generally does not obligate one to act. What is the overriding interest that would preclude such a duty? What exceptions to this no-duty principle do we see at work or referenced in the above cases?</p>
<p id="65ccb48c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Restatement View of a Duty to Act</i>.</b> Restatement (Second) of Torts §314 (1965) provides: “The fact that the actor realizes or should realize that action on his part is necessary for another’s aid or protection does not of itself impose upon him a duty to take such action.” Illustration no. 4 to this section provides this example: “A, a strong swimmer, sees B, against whom he entertains an unreasonable hatred, floundering in deep water and obviously unable to swim. Knowing B’s identity, he turns away. A is not liable to B.” While this is the common law in America, many European countries disagree. Further, there is a small number of northeastern states that by legislative fiat have changed this common law rule and require an actor with actual knowledge of another’s peril to render aid if such is possible without exposing the rescuer to danger.</p>
<p id="65ccb48d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Special Relationships Can Create an Obligation to Act</i>.</b> The court in <i>Lundy</i> references the judicial rulings requiring an employer to provide aid to an injured employee on the job. And the Restatement provision quoted in <i>Lundy</i> mentions three other instances where the default no-duty assumption is rejected—in cases involving common carriers, innkeepers, and property owners with injured customers. Do these groups have anything in common that might explain the exceptional rule demanding that they take some action to assist others? Two ideas spring to mind. First, that in these relationships the defendant seems to be in a position to profit in some manner from the presence of the plaintiff; therefore, imposing a duty of care requiring action does not seem unfair. Second, in these scenarios, the plaintiff is generally put in a <span title="316" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-316">p. 316</span>position of having to rely upon the defendant for protection. The confluence of these two general thoughts seems to be enough impetus under the common law to overcome the no-duty common law rule and to instead compel (reasonable) actions.</p>
<p id="65ccb48e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Good Samaritan Statutes.</i></b> As the court in <i>Lundy</i> states, Good Samaritan statutes are designed to remove the threat of litigation as a potential disincentive to assisting gratuitously one in need. One has to be careful not to treat all such legislation as the same. The way the statute is phrased can lead to very different levels of protection. Consider the disparate levels of protection under the following two states’ Good Samaritan statutes. With respect to each, who may take advantage of the statute’s protection? What level of immunity from common law negligence is offered? How successful would you anticipate each statute being in removing the chill arising from the common law’s imposition of a duty of reasonable care upon rescuers?</p>

As the foregoing cases illustrate, however, the common law generally imposes on actors a duty to act with reasonable care. In cases of <i>failure to act</i>, the default rule is that there is no duty to act with reasonable care. The Restatement (Third) of Torts does a pretty good job explaining how courts actually operate consistent with these default positions:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65ccdbab-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ordinarily, an actor whose conduct creates risks of physical harm to others has a duty to exercise reasonable care. Except in unusual categories of cases in which courts have developed no-duty rules, an actor’s duty to exercise reasonable care does not require attention from the court.</p></div>
<p id="65ccdbac-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Restatement (Third) of Torts §6, comment B. (2011). Do you see how this Restatement provision demonstrates a general judicial rejection of Judge Cardozo’s limited view of duty and seems much closer to Judge Andrews’ assumption that generally a duty of care exists (at least in cases involving <i>affirmative acts</i>) toward others? This does not mean that a duty always exists when an actor acts. We will see multiple examples where courts, having paused at the element of duty, have seen fit to negate or limit the duty for some other reason. Yet another provision in the Third Restatement provides the mirror image to the presumption of a duty for actors whose affirmative conduct has created a risk of harm. Section 37 provides that, with respect to actors who are not accused of affirmative conduct creating the risk of harm, no general duty is presumed: “An actor whose conduct has not created a risk of physical…harm to another has no duty of care to the other unless the court determines that one of the affirmative duties [otherwise found] is applicable.”</p>

The Restatement urges caution in this regard: “The distinction [between acts and omissions] can be misleading. The proper question is…whether the actor’s entire conduct created a risk of harm. [A] failure to employ an automobile’s brakes…is not a case of nonfeasance [because] the entirety of the actor’s conduct (driving an automobile) created a risk of harm.”</p>

<p id="65cd02c1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>6. Palsgraf <i>Revisited.</i></b> Given this common law dichotomy between acts and omissions, would the law generally impose upon the employees of the Long Island Railway an obligation to act with reasonable care when they undertake to perform some task? Was the Long Island Railway accused of failing to take action or of taking some careless action? It seems that the essence of Mrs. Palsgraf’s complaint in that case was that when the employees of the defendant reached out and put their hands upon the leaping passenger, they failed to exercise reasonable care. While Judge Cardozo said that some foreseeable harm particular to the plaintiff was necessary to trigger a duty, what does the Restatement provision quote above indicate? In fact, the Third <span title="318" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-318">p. 318</span>Restatement has rather directly refuted Cardozo’s contention that the “orbit of danger” sets the duty of care:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65cd02c2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A no-duty ruling represents a determination, a purely legal question, that no liability should be imposed on actors in a category of cases. These reasons…do not depend on the foreseeability of harm based on the specific facts of a case. They should be articulated directly without obscuring references to foreseeability.</p></div>
<p id="65cd02c3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Restatement (Third) of Torts §7 comment j (2011). Thus, because the Long Island Railway employees affirmatively acted in a way that created a risk of harm, they presumptively owed Mrs. Palsgraf a duty of reasonable care, regardless of whether they could foresee danger to her specifically. Furthermore, as <i>Lundy</i> notes, common carriers (including railways) have special relationships with their passengers that create duties that would not otherwise even exist under the common law. The facts of <i>Palsgraf</i> indicate that Mrs. Palsgraf was a passenger of the defendant waiting for her train to arrive. Given these considerations, does it now strike you as odd that Judge Cardozo chose to deal with the issue of a surprising outcome under the rubric of duty rather than proximate cause?</p>
<p id="65cd02c4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>7. <i>Exception Where Defendant Caused the Peril.</i></b> Another recognized exception to the no-duty to rescue rule is when the defendant has wrongfully created the peril in the first instance. If a defendant has caused an accident, he has a duty of reasonable care to effectuate some rescue or to at least seek help from others. This can either be understood as an exception to the no-duty to rescue rule or as a mere practical reality of his liability in the first instance. If you have wrongfully caused an accident, you will already be held legally responsible for the resulting injuries. If you fail to lessen these injuries through rescue efforts, you are already liable for the full extent of the harm by virtue of your tort in causing the accident. It is in your interest to reduce, or mitigate, the totality of the damages if possible. Regardless of the theory, a tortfeasor has every incentive to lessen his liability by reducing the ultimate harm.</p>

<p id="65cd29e4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is an appeal by Patricia Boyette (Appellant) from the trial court’s decision granting summary judgment for Trans World Express (TWE) in her wrongful death action for the death of her son, Joseph Rutherford (Rutherford). Because TWE presented uncontested facts negating the element of duty, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>
<p id="65cd29e5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On April 2, 1989, Rutherford and three co-workers took TWE flight 7145 from Memphis, Tennessee to Sioux City, Iowa with a change of planes at Lambert International Airport. Andrea Lake (Lake) was the sole flight attendant on this flight. Prior to departure from Memphis, Rutherford had at least two drinks containing alcohol. During a ground delay in Memphis, and for the duration of the Memphis to St. Louis flight, Rutherford consumed six more alcoholic drinks.</p>
<p id="65cd50f6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once TWE flight 7145 arrived in St. Louis, Rutherford deplaned onto the tarmac with the other passengers. While on the way to the terminal, Rutherford passed under a yellow rope and climbed onto a luggage tug that was idling on the tarmac. Britney Callier (Callier), a TWE gate agent, radioed his supervisor and requested airport security. The supervisor contacted airport security at 4:23 p.m. <span title="320" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-320">p. 320</span>Upon learning of the dispatch to airport security, Rutherford slid off the tug and entered the terminal without further incident. At 4:33 p.m. Callier’s supervisor contacted airport security and informed them that their help was no longer needed.</p>
<p id="65cd50f7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once inside the terminal Rutherford made his way toward the gate from which his connecting flight was departing. On the way to the gate, Rutherford stole an electric golf cart and began driving around the gate area. Callier, who at this point had returned to the terminal to begin boarding passengers on another outbound flight, chased Rutherford on foot in an effort to stop him or to maintain sight of him until security could be summoned.</p>
<p id="65cd50f8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Callier eventually cornered Rutherford in an alcove off of the D concourse and informed Rutherford’s co-workers that Rutherford was going to jail. However, Callier was unable to locate Rutherford in the alcove [as Rutherford had escaped to Room D-231, a cleaning room that had been left unlocked. This room contained a small door leading to a trash chute that, in turn led to a trash compactor 10 feet below. Inside the compactor was an electric eye that, if blocked for more than 8 seconds, would begin to compact all “trash” inside].</p>
<p id="65cd50f9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[In an attempt to evade further detection, Rutherford climbed into the trash chute.] Rutherford climbed too far into the trash chute and fell into the trash compactor ten feet below, injuring himself in the fall. [A colleague of Rutherford’s informed TWE personnel at 4:51 that Rutherford had fallen into the trash chute. TWE personnel radioed for assistance in finding a shut-off switch for the compactor. Before this happened, however, TWE personnel heard the compactor start. By the time they shut it off, Rutherford’s body had been compacted. He was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead.]</p>
<p id="65cd50fa-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant filed a wrongful death action against TWE…and others. In her petition, the appellant claimed TWE acted negligently by chasing Rutherford through the concourse after he commandeered the golf cart and, once he was discovered in the trash compactor, failing to take necessary steps to ensure Rutherford’s safety. On November 14, 1994, the trial court granted TWE’s motion for summary judgment. From this order and judgment, the appellant appeals.</p>
<p id="65cd50fb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The appellant argues the trial court erred in granting the…motion for summary judgment on her negligence cause of action. It is well-established law that in order to maintain a negligence cause of action the appellant must establish: “1) the existence of a duty on the part of the defendant to protect [Rutherford] from injury; 2) a breach of that duty; 3) that defendant’s breach proximately caused [Rutherford’s] injuries.” <i>Krause v. United States Truck Co., Inc.</i>, 787 S.W.2d 708, 710 (Mo. banc 1990); <i>Strickland v. Taco Bell Corp</i>, 849 S.W.2d 127, 131 (Mo. App. E.D. 1993). If the appellant fails to show the existence of a duty owed by…TWE to Rutherford, she cannot maintain a negligence cause of action.</p>
<p id="65cd50fc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The appellant contends the pursuit of Rutherford by TWE employees after he commandeered the golf cart expanded the duration of the duty of care TWE, as a common carrier, owed to Rutherford. We disagree.</p>
<p id="65cd50fd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Missouri has long recognized a special relationship exists between a common carrier, like TWE, and its passengers. “A common carrier has a duty to exercise the highest degree of care to safely transport its passengers and <span title="321" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-321">p. 321</span>protect them while in transit.” <i>Collier v. Bi-State Dev. Agency</i>, 700 S.W.2d 479, 480 (Mo. App. E.D. 1985). But this duty exists only so long as the special relationship of passenger and carrier exists. <i>Meyer v. St. Louis Pub. Serv. Co</i>., 253 S.W.2d 525 (Mo. App. 1952). The carrier discharges its duty once the passenger reaches a reasonably safe place. <i>Sanford v. Bi-State Dev. Agency</i>, 705 S.W.2d 572 (Mo. App. E.D. 1986). In the instant case it is without dispute Rutherford safely reached the airport. Thus, TWE fulfilled the duty it owed Rutherford as a common carrier once he reached the airport terminal. At that point TWE’s duty as a common carrier was discharged. [Whether a “reasonably safe place” is the tarmac or the terminal matters not in this case.]</p>
<p id="65cd50fe-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At oral arguments the appellant suggested that even if TWE’s duty as a common carrier was discharged once Rutherford reached the airport terminal, a new duty arose once TWE initiated pursuit of Rutherford. We disagree. [The court further held that even if a duty could be found, there was no proximate cause, as the crushing death was too remote a consequence to chasing someone through the airport.]</p>
<p id="65cd50ff-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because TWE’s duty as a common carrier was discharged once Rutherford reached the airport terminal and because, even assuming a new duty arose from Callier’s pursuit, there is no causal connection between Callier’s pursuit and Rutherford’s death, the trial court’s grant of summary judgment for TWE is affirmed.</p>

McCoy walked back on the shoulder of the roadway to his car with a lit flare in his roadside hand. When McCoy was within three or four car-lengths of the trooper, the trooper pulled away without comment. Moments later McCoy was struck from behind while still walking on the roadway’s shoulder by a hit-and-run vehicle.</p>

<p id="65cd9f34-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">McCoy and his wife filed a multicount complaint against [various defendants, including the driver of the Suzuki and the State of Washington as well as against] American Suzuki Motor Corporation and its parent corporation, Suzuki Motor Company, Ltd., for its allegedly defective Samurai which allegedly caused the wreck in the first place. We presently consider only McCoy’s claim against Suzuki.</p>
<p id="65cd9f35-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">McCoy alleged the Suzuki Samurai was defectively designed and manufactured, was not reasonably safe by virtue of its tendency to roll, and lacked proper warnings. McCoy also alleged these defects caused the principal accident, that he was injured while a rescuer within the purview of the “rescue doctrine,” and Suzuki should therefore be held liable for his injuries.</p>
<p id="65cd9f36-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suzuki moved for summary judgment asserting: (1) the rescue doctrine does not apply to product liability actions; and (2) even if it does, McCoy must still, but cannot, prove Suzuki proximately caused his injuries. The trial court found the rescue doctrine applies to product liability actions but concluded any alleged defect in the Suzuki was not the proximate cause of McCoy’s injuries and, accordingly, granted summary judgment of dismissal.</p>
<p id="65cd9f37-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">McCoy appealed the dismissal to the Court of Appeals which reversed in a published, split decision. The appellate court found the rescue doctrine applies in product liability actions just as it does in negligence actions. The court agreed with the trial court that McCoy’s injuries were not proximately caused by Suzuki; however, it held under the rescue doctrine an injured rescuer need not prove the defendant proximately caused his injuries. Instead the court concluded the rescuer need only prove the defendant proximately caused the danger and that the rescuer was injured while rescuing.</p>
<p id="65cd9f38-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeals thus concluded McCoy alleged sufficient facts to avoid summary judgment of dismissal and, accordingly, remanded for trial. We granted review.</p>

<p id="65cd9f3a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rescue doctrine is invoked in tort cases for a variety of purposes in a variety of scenarios. The doctrine, as here asserted, allows an injured rescuer to sue the party which caused the danger requiring the rescue in the first place. As Justice Cardozo succinctly summarized, the heart of this doctrine is the notion that “danger invites rescue.” <i>Wagner v. International Ry. Co.</i>, 232 N.Y. 176, 133 N.E. 437, 437, 19 A.L.R. 1 (1921). This doctrine serves two functions. First, it informs a tortfeasor it is foreseeable a rescuer will come to the aid of the person imperiled by the tortfeasor’s actions, and, therefore, the tortfeasor owes the rescuer a duty similar to the duty he owes the person he imperils. Second, the rescue doctrine negates the presumption that the rescuer assumed the risk of injury when he knowingly undertook the dangerous rescue, so long as he does not act rashly or recklessly.</p>
<p id="65cd9f3b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To achieve rescuer status one must demonstrate: (1) the defendant was negligent to the person rescued and such negligence caused the peril or <span title="324" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-324">p. 324</span>appearance of peril to the person rescued; (2) the peril or appearance of peril was imminent; (3) a reasonably prudent person would have concluded such peril or appearance of peril existed; and (4) the rescuer acted with reasonable care in effectuating the rescue. The Court of Appeals found McCoy demonstrated sufficient facts of rescuer status to put the issue of whether he met the four requirements…to the jury. Suzuki does not question this finding. Nor will we.</p>

<p id="65cd9f3d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suzuki argues the rescue doctrine may not be invoked in product liability actions. Suzuki contends the PLA supplants all common law remedies and contends the rescue doctrine is nothing more than a common law remedy. We disagree. The rescue doctrine is not a common law remedy. Rather, it is shorthand for the idea that rescuers are to be anticipated and is a reflection of a societal value judgment that rescuers should not be barred from bringing suit for knowingly placing themselves in danger to undertake a rescue. We can conceive of no reason why this doctrine should not apply with equal force when a product manufacturer causes the danger.</p>

<p id="65cd9f3f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">McCoy argues the rescue doctrine relieves the rescuer-plaintiff of proving the defendant’s wrongdoing proximately caused his injuries. McCoy asserts a rescuer may prevail in a suit by showing the defendant proximately caused the danger and that, while serving as rescuer, the plaintiff was injured. The Court of Appeals agreed stating the rescue doctrine “varies the ordinary rules of negligence.” <i>McCoy</i>, 86 Wn. App. at 110 (citing <i>Solgaard v. Guy F. Atkinson Co.</i>, 6 Cal. 3d 361, 491 P.2d 821, 99 Cal. Rptr. 29 (1971)).</p>
<p id="65cd9f40-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeals erred on this point. [T]he rescuer, like any other plaintiff, must still show the defendant proximately caused his injuries.</p>
<p id="65cd9f41-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, Suzuki argues, it was totally unforeseeable that a rescuer such as McCoy would be injured by a third vehicle under these particular facts and, accordingly, Suzuki asks us to rule in its favor on this issue as a matter of law. We find the issue of foreseeability of the intervening cause is sufficiently close that it should be decided by a jury, not the court. A jury might consider the position of the rescuer, the negligence of the oncoming motorist, if any, and many other factors.</p>
<p id="65cd9f42-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the present case, if the Suzuki Samurai is found to be defective the jury could find it foreseeable that the Suzuki Samurai would roll and that an approaching car would cause injury to either those in the Suzuki Samurai or to a rescuer, depending on the specific facts to be proved. We note sister jurisdictions have reached the same conclusion under similar facts.</p>

Accordingly, we will not dismiss this case for lack of legal causation. Instead we remand the case for trial consistent with this opinion.</p>

This legal boost to the foreseeability of a rescuer at the scene can help (a) remove any doubt about the defendant owing the rescuer a duty of care (to the extent, like Cardozo, the court might be reluctant to find such a duty), and (b) assist with proving proximate causation to the extent that the court is utilizing a foreseeability test for proximate cause, or analyzing whether the actions of the rescuer might constitute a superseding cause.</p>

<p id="65cdc660-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question in this case is whether the so-called Firefighter’s Rule applies in Alaska. The Firefighter’s Rule holds that firefighters and police officers who are injured may not recover based on the negligent conduct that required their presence. For public policy reasons we join the overwhelming majority of states that have adopted the rule.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="65cdc661-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p></div>
<p id="65cdc662-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The facts of this case are undisputed. On or around July 25, 1996, a Delta Western employee left a fuel truck owned by Delta Western in a driveway in Dillingham. The keys were in the ignition, the door was unlocked, and the truck contained fuel and weighed over 10,000 pounds. Delta Western had a policy of <span title="326" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-326">p. 326</span>removing the keys from the ignitions of its trucks. Delta Western enacted this policy because of past incidents involving the theft and unauthorized entry of its trucks.</p>
<p id="65cdc663-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Joseph Coolidge, who was highly intoxicated, entered the unlocked truck and proceeded to drive around Dillingham. He ran cars off the road, nearly collided with several vehicles, and drove at speeds exceeding seventy miles per hour. Brent Moody, the chief of the Dillingham Police Department, was one of the officers who responded to the reports of the recklessly driven fuel truck. The driver of the van in which Moody was a passenger attempted to stop the truck after moving in front of it, but Coolidge rammed the van, throwing Moody against the dashboard and windshield. Moody suffered permanent injuries.</p>
<p id="65cdc664-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moody filed suit against Delta Western, alleging that the company (through its employee) negligently failed to remove the truck’s keys from the ignition. In its amended answer, Delta Western argued that the “Firefighter’s Rule” barred Moody’s cause of action. Delta Western moved for summary judgment based on its Firefighter’s Rule defense. The superior court granted Delta Western’s motion, holding that the Firefighter’s Rule bars police officers from recovering for injuries caused by the “negligence which creates the very occasion for their engagement.”</p>
<p id="65cdc665-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nearly all of the courts that have considered whether or not to adopt the Firefighter’s Rule have in fact adopted it. Only one court [the Oregon Supreme Court] has rejected it.</p>
<p id="65cdc666-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both [firefighters and police officers] are paid to confront crises and allay dangers by an uncircumspect citizenry, a circumstance that serves to distinguish firefighters and police from most other public employees. Citizens summon police and firefighters to confront danger. Government entities maintain police and fire departments in anticipation of those inevitable physical perils that burden the human condition, whereas most public employment posts are created not to confront dangers that will arise but to perform some other public function that may incidentally involve risk.</p>
<p id="65cdc667-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This fundamental concept rests on the assumption that government entities employ firefighters and police officers, at least in part, to deal with the hazards that may result from their taxpayers’ own future acts of negligence. Exposing the negligent taxpayer to liability for having summoned police would impose upon him multiple burdens for that protection.</p>
<p id="65cdc668-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Jurisdictions adopting the Firefighter’s Rule emphasize its narrowness; the doctrine bars only recovery for the negligence that creates the need for the public safety officer’s service. Thus the Firefighter’s Rule does not apply to negligent conduct occurring after the police officer or firefighter arrives at the scene or to misconduct other than that which necessitates the officer’s presence. [<i>Kreski</i>, 415 N.W.2d 178, 189 (Mich. 1987) (recognizing exceptional cases, such as those involving willful misconduct, in which courts have refused to apply firefighter’s rule to bar action).]</p>
<p id="65cdc669-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Modern courts stress interrelated reasons, based on public policy, for the rule. The negligent party is said to have no duty to the public safety officer to act <span title="327" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-327">p. 327</span>without negligence in creating the condition that necessitates the officer’s intervention because the officer is employed by the public to respond to such conditions and receives compensation and benefits for the risks inherent in such responses. Requiring members of the public to pay for injuries resulting from such responses effectively imposes a double payment obligation on them. Further, because negligence is at the root of many calls for public safety officers, allowing recovery would compound the growth of litigation.</p>
<p id="65cdc66a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts find an analogy in cases in which a contractor is injured while repairing the condition that necessitated his employment. In these cases, the owner is under no duty to protect the contractor against risks arising from the condition the contractor is hired to repair, and thus is not liable even if the condition was the product of the owner’s negligence. This “contractor for repairs” exception to the general duty of reasonable care is grounded in necessity and fairness. Property owners should not be deterred by the threat of liability to the contractor from summoning experts to repair their property, regardless of why repairs are needed. Further, owners have paid for the contractor’s expertise at confronting the very danger that injured him and should not have to pay again if the contractor is then injured. The same factors are found to apply with respect to the public’s need to call for the services of public safety officers.</p>
<p id="65cdc66b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree with the reasoning of the modern courts and with the analogy to contractor cases. The Firefighter’s Rule reflects sound public policy.</p>
<p id="65cdc66c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We thus conclude that the Firefighter’s Rule applies in Alaska. We reach this conclusion based on the merits of the rule as accepted by the overwhelming majority of the courts of our sister states. It follows that summary judgment was properly granted.</p>

<p id="65ce139b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On March 23, 1983, Rodriguez drove her automobile over and critically injured a small child. At the time of the accident, Snellenberger was employed as a police officer by the City of Pecos. When he and another officer were notified of the accident, they immediately proceeded to the scene in their separate patrol cars. Upon arrival, the other officer administered CPR to the child, while officer Snellenberger moved back the crowd of people which had gathered at the scene. Included in the crowd was the grief-stricken mother of the injured child. As officer Snellenberger began controlling the crowd, he suddenly collapsed and later died of a heart attack. His widow and children brought this action relying upon the rescue doctrine.</p>
<p id="65ce139c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a matter of public policy, the rescue doctrine supports the heroic acts of individuals who rush into danger to rescue others from imminent peril.

<p id="65ce3ab6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Rescue Doctrine Does Not Ensure Victory.</i></b> Even though the court in <i>Snellenberger</i> is willing to apply the <i>Rescue Doctrine</i> to these facts, it still holds that a necessary element—proximate cause—cannot be satisfied. If the doctrine is supposed to, in part, help bolster a plaintiff rescuer’s arguments for foreseeability, why does the plaintiff still lose? Why, as a matter of law, isn’t the injury here reasonably foreseeable even if “danger invites rescue?” Consider how the facts differ between <i>Snellenberg</i> and <i>McCoy</i>. If the doctrine informs the tortfeasor of the likely presence of a rescuer at the scene of an accident caused by the tortfeasor’s misconduct, the courts seem to be saying that the risk of a secondary auto accident is reasonably foreseeable while the risk of a heart attack at the scene of a traffic accident is a seemingly random event that is not reasonably foreseeable. What these cases illustrate is that the <i>Rescue Doctrine</i> aids a plaintiff-rescuer by enhancing her foreseeability argument, but the doctrine has limits and does not guarantee a recovery.</p>

<p id="65ce3aba-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">As we have seen, a primary distinction in negligence cases exists between a defendant’s acts and a defendant’s omissions. While either can be the basis for a negligence claim, when the defendant has acted in a way that caused the plaintiff’s injury, courts normally assume there was a duty of reasonable care, but assume no duty existed in cases of omissions. These are general rules that are subject to exceptions. Special relationships are a primary circumstance that varies this no-duty presumption, as we saw in <i>Lundy</i>. We have seen mention of employers, common carriers, hoteliers, <span title="330" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-330">p. 330</span>and businesses open to the public as examples of such relationships that vary the common law blessing on inactivity. With respect to those who choose to become rescuers, the common law would impose a duty of care upon them, but Good Samaritan statutes often overcome this—subject to the language of the particular statute applicable. But unless the rescuer is a firefighter or police officer, the common law generally makes it easier for a rescuer to sue the original tortfeasor by enhancing foreseeability arguments and making clear that the duty that ran toward the original victim also runs to the rescuer.</p>

<p id="65ce3abd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">In the prior section we saw the default rule that actions typically require due care, but that inaction owes no duty of care. We also encountered exceptions to this principle based upon a “special” relationship between the tortfeasor and the victim—relationships such as employer-employee, landowner-customer, common carrier-passenger, and innkeeper-guest. Sometimes the victim does not have any special relationship with the defendant but courts still impose a duty to act with reasonable care. These exceptions involve factual scenarios where the tortfeasor has a <i>special relationship</i> with the one who is the source of the victim’s harm. This can be articulated in terms of a duty to warn the victim or, at times, a duty to control the one threatening harm. We will cover two areas where this exceptional duty rule has been applied—in the context of health care workers and employers.</p>

Later in this chapter we will consider the special rules applicable to such medical malpractice lawsuits. But what about a health care professional’s obligation to protect third parties from harm caused by the patient? In what circumstances can the relationship between the doctor and patient obligate the doctor to take action to protect third parties at risk of harm from the patient? The <i>Emerich</i> and <i>Bradshaw</i> cases below discuss two circumstances where the patient might pose a risk of harm to others—when the patient suffers a mental illness and has manifest a desire to harm another and when the patient suffers a contagious disease.</p>

<p id="65ce88e7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We granted allocatur limited to the issues of one, whether a mental health professional has a duty to warn a third party of a patient’s threat to harm the third party; two, if there is a duty to warn, the scope thereof; and finally, whether in this case a judgment on the pleadings was proper.</p>
<p id="65ce88e8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This admittedly tragic matter arises from the murder of Appellant’s decedent, Teresa Hausler, by her former boyfriend, Gad Joseph (“Joseph”). At the time of the murder, Joseph was being treated for mental illness and drug problems. Appellant brought wrongful death and survival actions against Appellees. Judgment on the pleadings was granted in favor of Appellees by the trial court and was affirmed on appeal by the Superior Court.</p>
<p id="65ce88e9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A detailed recitation of the facts is necessary to analyze the complex and important issues before us. The factual allegations raised in Appellant’s complaint, which we must accept as true, are as follows.</p>
<p id="65ce88ea-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ms. Hausler and Joseph, girlfriend and boyfriend, were cohabitating in Philadelphia. For a substantial period of time, both Ms. Hausler and Joseph had been receiving mental health treatment at Appellee Philadelphia Center for Human Development (the “Center” or “PCHD”). Appellee Anthony Scuderi was a counselor at the Center.</p>
<p id="65ce88eb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Joseph was diagnosed as suffering from, among other illnesses, post-traumatic stress disorder, drug and alcohol problems, and explosive and schizo-affective personality disorders. He also had a history of physically and verbally abusing Ms. Hausler, as well as his former wife, and a history of other violent propensities. Joseph often threatened to murder Ms. Hausler and suffered from homicidal ideations.</p>
<p id="65ce88ec-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Several weeks prior to June 27, 1991, Ms. Hausler ended her relationship with Joseph, moved from their Philadelphia residence, and relocated to Reading, Pennsylvania. Angered by Ms. Hausler’s decision to terminate their relationship, Joseph had indicated during several therapy sessions at the Center that he wanted to harm Ms. Hausler.</p>
<p id="65ce88ed-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the morning of June 27, 1991, at or about 9:25 a.m., Joseph telephoned his counselor, Mr. Scuderi, and advised him that he was going to kill Ms. Hausler. Mr. Scuderi immediately scheduled and carried out a therapy session with Joseph at 11:00 that morning. During the therapy session, Joseph told Mr. Scuderi that his irritation with Ms. Hausler was becoming worse because that day she was returning to their apartment to get her clothing, that he was under great stress, and that he was going to kill her if he found her removing her clothing from their residence.</p>
<p id="65ce88ee-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Scuderi recommended that Joseph voluntarily commit himself to a psychiatric hospital. Joseph refused; however, he stated that he was in control and <span title="332" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-332">p. 332</span>would not hurt Ms. Hausler. At 12:00 p.m., the therapy session ended, and, as stated in the complaint, Joseph was permitted to leave the Center “based solely upon his assurances that he would not harm” Ms. Hausler.</p>
<p id="65ce88ef-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At 12:15 p.m., Mr. Scuderi received a telephone call from Ms. Hausler informing him that she was in Philadelphia en route to retrieve her clothing from their apartment, located at 6924 Large Street. Ms. Hausler inquired as to Joseph’s whereabouts. Mr. Scuderi instructed Ms. Hausler not to go to the apartment and to return to Reading.</p>
<p id="65ce88f0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In what ultimately became a fatal decision, Ms. Hausler ignored Mr. Scuderi’s instructions and went to the residence where she was fatally shot by Joseph at or about 12:30 p.m. Five minutes later, Joseph telephoned Mr. Scuderi who in turn called the police at the instruction of Director Friedrich.</p>
<p id="65ce88f1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Joseph was subsequently arrested and convicted of the murder of Ms. Hausler. Based upon these facts, Appellant filed [this] wrongful death and survival action, alleging that Appellees negligently failed to properly warn Ms. Hausler, and others including her family, friends and the police, that Joseph presented a clear and present danger of harm to her.</p>
<p id="65ce88f2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of Appellees finding, inter alia, that the duty of a mental health professional to warn a third party had not yet been adopted in Pennsylvania, but that even if such a legal duty existed, Mr. Scuderi’s personal warning discharged that duty. The Superior Court affirmed, reiterating that mental health care providers currently have no duty to warn a third party of a patient’s violent propensities, and that even if such a duty existed, Appellant failed to establish a cause of action as his decedent was killed when she ignored Mr. Scuderi’s warning not to go to Joseph’s apartment.</p>
<p id="65ceb003-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Initially, we must determine if in this Commonwealth, a mental health care professional owes a duty to warn a third party of a patient’s threat of harm to that third party, and if so, the scope of such a duty. While this precise issue is one of first impression for this court, it is an issue which has been considered by a number of state and federal courts and has been the subject of much commentary. Supported by the wisdom of decisions from other jurisdictions, as well as by analogous decisions by this court and lower court case law in this Commonwealth, we determine that a mental health care professional, under certain limited circumstances, owes a duty to warn a third party of threats of harm against that third party. Nevertheless, we find that in this case, judgment on the pleadings was proper, and thus, we affirm the decision of the learned Superior Court, albeit, for different reasons.</p>
<p id="65ceb004-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under common law, as a general rule, there is no duty to control the conduct of a third party to protect another from harm. However, a judicial exception to the general rule has been recognized where a defendant stands in some special relationship with either the person whose conduct needs to be controlled or in a relationship with the intended victim of the conduct, which <span title="333" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-333">p. 333</span>gives to the intended victim a right to protection. <i>See, Restatement (Second) of Torts §315</i> (1965). Appellant argues that this exception, and thus, a duty, should be recognized in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p id="65ceb005-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our analysis must begin with the California Supreme Court’s landmark decision in <i>Tarasoff v. Regents of Univ. of California</i>, 551 P.2d 334 (1976), which was the first case to find that a mental health professional may have a duty to protect others from possible harm by their patients. In <i>Tarasoff</i>, a lawsuit was filed against, among others, psychotherapists employed by the Regents of the University of California to recover for the death of the plaintiffs’ daughter, Tatiana Tarasoff, who was killed by a psychiatric outpatient.</p>
<p id="65ceb006-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two months prior to the killing, the patient had expressly informed his therapist that he was going to kill an unnamed girl (who was readily identifiable as the plaintiffs’ daughter) when she returned home from spending the summer in Brazil. The therapist, with the concurrence of two colleagues, decided to commit the patient for observation. The campus police detained the patient at the oral and written request of the therapist, but released him after satisfying themselves that he was rational and exacting his promise to stay away from Ms. Tarasoff. The therapist’s superior directed that no further action be taken to confine or otherwise restrain the patient. No one warned either Ms. Tarasoff or her parents of the patient’s dangerousness.</p>
<p id="65ceb007-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After the patient murdered Ms. Tarasoff, her parents filed suit alleging, among other things, that the therapists involved had failed either to warn them of the threat to their daughter or to confine the patient.</p>
<p id="65ceb008-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The California Supreme Court, while recognizing the general rule that a person owes no duty to control the conduct of another, determined that there is an exception to this general rule where the defendant stands in a special relationship to either the person whose conduct needs to be controlled or in a relationship to the foreseeable victim of that conduct, citing <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts §315-320</i>. Applying that exception, the court found that the special relationship between the defendant therapists and the patient could support affirmative duties for the benefit of third persons. <i>Tarasoff</i>, 551 P.2d at 343.</p>
<p id="65ceb009-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court made an analogy to cases which have imposed a duty upon physicians to diagnose and warn about a patient’s contagious disease and concluded that “‘by entering into a doctor-patient relationship the therapist becomes sufficiently involved to assume some responsibility for the safety, not only of the patient himself, but also of any third person whom the doctor knows to be threatened by the patient.’” <i>Id.</i>, 551 P.2d at 344, quoting Fleming &amp; Maximov, The Patient and His Victim: The Therapist’s Dilemma, 62 Cal. L. Rev. 1025, 1030 (1974).</p>
<p id="65ceb00a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court also considered various public policy interests determining that the public interest in safety from violent assault outweighed countervailing interests of the confidentiality of patient therapist communications and the difficulty in predicting dangerousness. <i>Id.</i>, 551 P.2d at 344-48.</p>
<span title="334" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-334">p. 334</span>
<p id="65ceb00b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The California Supreme Court ultimately held:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65ceb00c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a therapist determines, or pursuant to the standards of his profession should determine, that his patient presents a serious danger of violence to another, he incurs an obligation to use reasonable care to protect the intended victim against such danger.</p></div>
<p id="65ceb00d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">551 P.2d at 340.</p>
<p id="65ced71e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Following <i>Tarasoff</i>, the vast majority of courts that have considered the issue have concluded that the relationship between a mental health care professional and his patient constitutes a special relationship which imposes upon the professional an affirmative duty to protect a third party against harm. Thus, the concept of a duty to protect by warning, albeit limited in certain circumstances, has met with virtually universal approval.</p>
<p id="65ced71f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We believe that the <i>Tarasoff</i> decision and its progeny are consistent with, and supported by, Pennsylvania case law and properly recognize that pursuant to the special relationship between a mental health professional and his patient, the mental health professional has a duty to warn a third party of potential harm by his patient.</p>
<p id="65ced720-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Further supporting the concept of a duty to warn, this court has already recognized the existence of a cause of action against a physician favoring a third person in the context of contagious disease, and, thus, has recognized certain legal duties on the part of a physician to protect another from future harm by a patient.</p>
<p id="65ced721-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>DiMarco v. Lynch Homes-Chester County, Inc.</i>, 583 A.2d 422 (1990), this court held that a physician may be liable to a non-patient third person who is injured because of his negligent treatment of a patient. In that case, a physician misinformed his patient, a blood technician who had been accidentally exposed to the communicable disease, hepatitis B, that if she remained symptom-free for six weeks she was not infected with the disease. While the patient was told to refrain from sexual relations for six weeks, she abstained from sex with her boyfriend for eight weeks. After eight weeks, when she was still symptom-free, the patient engaged in sexual relations. Both she and her partner were later diagnosed with hepatitis B. The patient’s boyfriend brought an action against, inter alia, the patient’s doctors alleging their negligence in not having warned the patient that having sexual relations within six months of exposure to hepatitis B could expose her sexual partner to the disease.</p>
<p id="65ced722-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This court extended the physician’s duty to encompass third parties whose health could be threatened by contact with the diseased patient.</p>
<p id="65ced723-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Such precautions are taken not to protect the health of the patient, whose well being has already been compromised, rather such precautions are taken to safeguard the health of others. Thus, the duty of a physician in such circumstances extends to those “within the foreseeable orbit of risk of harm” (citation omitted). <i>DiMarco</i>, 583 A.2d at 424.</p>
<span title="335" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-335">p. 335</span>
<p id="65ced724-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having found that a physician owes a duty to a non-patient third party, at least in the context of a contagious disease, we believe that there is no reason why an analogous duty to warn should not be recognized when the disease of the patient is a mental illness that may pose a potentially greater and more immediate risk of severe harm or death to others. <i>See, Peck</i>, 499 A.2d at 425.</p>
<p id="65ced725-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, sound principles of public policy support a duty to warn. It has been stated by this court that “in determining the existence of a duty of care, it must be remembered that the concept of duty amounts to no more than ‘the sum total of those considerations of policy which led the law to say that the particular plaintiff is entitled to protection’ from the harm suffered.” <i>Mazzagatti v. Everingham By Everingham</i>, 516 A.2d 672, 678 (1986)<i>.</i> Thus, recognition of a duty is in essence one of policy considerations.</p>
<p id="65ced726-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is axiomatic that important policy considerations exist regarding the public’s interest in safety from immediate and serious, if not deadly, harm. Countervailing policies regarding the treatment of mental health patients, specifically recognition of the difficulty in predicting violent behavior, the importance of confidential communications between therapist and patient, and the policy that patients be placed in the least restrictive environment must be acknowledged. We believe, however, that the societal interests in the protection of this Commonwealth’s citizens from harm mandates the finding of a duty to warn. Simply stated, it is reasonable to impose a duty on a mental health professional to warn a third party of an immediate, known and serious risk of potentially lethal harm. This is especially so considering the very circumscribed instances in which we find such a duty to warn arises, which are more fully discussed below.</p>
<p id="65ced727-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After consideration of the above, we find that the special relationship between a mental health professional and his patient may, in certain circumstances, give rise to an affirmative duty to warn for the benefit of an intended victim. We find, in accord with Tarasoff, that a mental health professional who determines, or under the standards of the mental health profession, should have determined, that his patient presents a serious danger of violence to another, bears a duty to exercise reasonable care to protect by warning the intended victim against such danger.</p>
<p id="65ced728-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mindful that the treatment of mental illness is not an exact science, we emphasize that we hold a mental health professional only to the standard of care of his profession, which takes into account the uncertainty of such treatment. Thus, we will not require a mental health professional to be liable for a patient’s violent behavior because he fails to predict such behavior accurately.</p>
<p id="65ced729-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, recognizing the importance of the therapist-patient relationship, the warning to the intended victim should be the least expansive based upon the circumstances.</p>
<p id="65ced72a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As stated by the court in <i>Tarasoff</i>,</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65ced72b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We realize that the open and confidential character of psychotherapeutic dialogue encourages patients to express threats of violence, few of which are ever executed. Certainly a therapist should not be encouraged routinely to reveal such threats; <span title="336" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-336">p. 336</span>such disclosures could seriously disrupt the patient’s relationship with his therapist and with the person threatened. To the contrary, the therapist’s obligations to his patient require that he not disclose a confidence unless such disclosure is necessary to avert danger to others, and even then that he do so discreetly, and in a fashion that would preserve the privacy of his patient to the fullest extent compatible with the prevention of the threatened danger.</p></div>
<p id="65ced72c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush"><i>Tarasoff</i>, 551 P.2d at 347.</p>
<p id="65ced72d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having determined that a mental health professional has a duty to protect by warning a third party of potential harm, we must further consider under what circumstances such a duty arises. We are extremely sensitive to the conundrum a mental health care professional faces regarding the competing concerns of productive therapy, confidentiality and other aspects of the patient’s well being, as well as an interest in public safety. In light of these valid concerns and the fact that the duty being recognized is an exception to the general rule that there is no duty to warn those endangered by another, we find that the circumstances in which a duty to warn a third party arises are extremely limited.</p>
<p id="65ced72e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, the predicate for a duty to warn is the existence of a specific and immediate threat of serious bodily injury that has been communicated to the professional. We believe that in light of the relationship between a mental health professional and patient, a relationship in which often vague and imprecise threats are made by an agitated patient as a routine part of the relationship, that only in those situations in which a specific and immediate threat is communicated can a duty to warn be recognized.</p>
<p id="65ced72f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, the duty to warn will only arise where the threat is made against a specifically identified or readily identifiable victim. Strong reasons support the determination that the duty to warn must have some limits. We are cognizant of the fact that the nature of therapy encourages patients to profess threats of violence, few of which are acted upon. Public disclosure of every generalized threat would vitiate the therapist’s efforts to build a trusting relationship necessary for progress. Moreover, as a practical matter, a mental health care professional would have great difficulty in warning the public at large of a threat against an unidentified person. Even if possible, warnings to the general public would “produce a cacophony of warnings that by reason of their sheer volume would add little to the effective protection of the public.” <i>Thompson</i>, 614 P.2d at 735.</p>
<p id="65cefe40-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, drawing on the wisdom of prior analysis, and common sense, we believe that a duty to warn arises only where a specific and immediate threat of serious bodily injury has been conveyed by the patient to the professional regarding a specifically identified or readily identifiable victim.</p>
<p id="65cefe41-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[With regard to Appellees’ argument about the importance of confidentiality in the treatment of mental health patients, this] court is aware of the critical role that confidentiality plays in the relationship between therapist and patient, constituting, as one author has described, the “sine qua non of successful psychiatric <span title="337" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-337">p. 337</span>treatment.” <i>Commonwealth ex rel. Platt v. Platt</i>, 266 Pa. Super. 276, 304, 404 A.2d 410, 425 (1979). Nevertheless, we believe that the protection against disclosure of confidential information gained in the therapist-patient relationship does not bar the finding of a duty to warn.</p>
<p id="65cefe42-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[S]imply stated, regulations promulgated by the State Board of Psychology, which include a majority of members with license to practice psychology, recognize an exception in the case of a serious threat of harm to an identified or readily identifiable person.</p>
<p id="65cefe43-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Based upon the above, it is clear that the law regarding privileged communications between patient and mental health care professional is not violated by, and does not prohibit, a finding of a duty on the part of a mental health professional to warn an intended victim of a patient’s threats of serious bodily harm. As succinctly stated by the court in <i>Tarasoff</i>, “The protective privilege ends where the public peril begins.” <i>Tarasoff, 551 P.2d at 347</i>.</p>
<p id="65cefe44-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In summary, we find that in Pennsylvania, based upon the special relationship between a mental health professional and his patient, when the patient has communicated to the professional a specific and immediate threat of serious bodily injury against a specifically identified or readily identifiable third party and when the professional, determines, or should determine under the standards of the mental health profession, that his patient presents a serious danger of violence to the third party, then the professional bears a duty to exercise reasonable care to protect by warning the third party against such danger.</p>
<p id="65cefe45-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally we must decide whether judgment on the pleadings was proper in this case. Viewing the facts as averred in the complaint, with all reasonable inferences therefrom, it is clear that Joseph was a patient of Appellees and was being treated by Appellees for mental illness. Further, Joseph had a definite, established, long term and ongoing relationship with the Center, and with Mr. Scuderi in particular. Thus, sufficient facts were pled to support the existence of a special relationship between Appellees and Joseph, while Joseph was being treated as an outpatient, which is necessary for the finding of a duty to warn.</p>
<p id="65cefe46-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, the complaint alleges that in the course of his treatment, Joseph stated to Mr. Scuderi that if Ms. Hausler came to his apartment that day, he was going to kill her. Thus, Joseph communicated a specific and immediate threat of serious bodily harm against a specifically identified victim. The complaint alleges that Mr. Scuderi knew or should have known that Joseph was a clear and present danger of harm to Ms. Hausler. Consistent with the decision rendered by the court today, and specifically, consistent with the limitations regarding when a duty to warn arises, the facts as stated in the complaint are sufficient to support a finding of the existence of a duty to warn.</p>
<p id="65cefe47-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having determined that the facts set forth in the complaint are sufficient to support a finding of the existence of a duty to warn, we turn to consider whether the instructions given by Mr. Scuderi to Ms. Hausler discharged any such duty. Both lower courts in this matter found, and Appellees argue, that Mr. Scuderi discharged any duty to warn as a matter of law.</p>
<span title="338" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-338">p. 338</span>
<p id="65cefe48-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While the existence of a duty is a question of law, whether there has been a neglect of such duty is generally for the jury. However, the issue of whether an act or a failure to act constitutes negligence may be removed from consideration by a jury and decided as a matter of law when the case is free from doubt and there is no possibility that a reasonable jury could find negligence.</p>
<p id="65cefe49-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our determination as to whether Appellees breached any duty as a matter of law is really an inquiry as to whether the instruction given by Mr. Scuderi was adequate to discharge a duty to warn. A mental health care professional’s warning must be reasonable under the particular circumstances. See <i>Tarasoff</i>, 551 P.2d at 345. This consideration of the reasonableness of the warning under the circumstances is eminently sound as different warnings, depending upon the attendant circumstances in each case, may be given to maintain patient confidentiality, and, at the same time, to prevent serious bodily harm.</p>
<p id="65cefe4a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, the facts as alleged in the complaint disclose that Joseph had physically and verbally abused Ms. Hausler in the past and had often threatened to murder her. Thus, Ms. Hausler knew of Joseph’s history of violent propensities. It was Ms. Hausler who telephoned Mr. Scuderi on the date in question. She informed Mr. Scuderi that she was en route to pick up her clothing at their apartment and inquired as to the whereabouts of Joseph. A reasonable inference from her telephone call and inquiry as to the whereabouts of Joseph is that Ms. Hausler was concerned for her safety. Mr. Scuderi informed Ms. Hausler not to go to Joseph’s residence and instructed her to return to her lodgment in Reading.</p>
<p id="65cefe4b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After consideration of the facts as pled regarding the circumstances surrounding the events of June 27, 1991, and after consideration of Mr. Scuderi’s specific instructions designed to prevent the threatened harm, including the reasonable inferences that Ms. Hausler knew of Joseph’s violent propensities and that she telephoned Mr. Scuderi in concern for her safety, we find that Mr. Scuderi’s warning was reasonable as a matter of law. The warning was discreet and in accord with preserving the privacy of his patient to the maximum extent possible consistent with preventing the threatened harm to Ms. Hausler. Thus, Mr. Scuderi discharged any duty to warn.</p>
<p id="65cefe4c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While this matter evokes great sympathy, we agree with the lower courts that after examining the complaint in this case, it is clear that on the facts averred, as a matter of law, recovery by Appellant is not possible. Thus, judgment on the pleadings was proper.</p>

Which of these provisions does the court in <i>Emerich</i> rely upon to support its decision to recognize a new duty? Under the actual facts of that case, would the other provision also arguably apply?</p>
<p id="65cf2564-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Role of Foreseeability.</i></b> Special duty rules are often crafted with the concept of foreseeability. In the case of the so-called <i>Tarasoff</i> rule, there are two essential components of the doctor’s duty of care. First, the doctor has a special relationship with the patient who is the source of the harm to the plaintiff. Absent this relationship, the common law default rule of no duty to act would prevail. Second, there is enhanced foreseeability of harm to the third party in situations where the patient has manifest a serious threat of immediate harm to a readily identifiable victim. Given both the special relationship and the enhanced foreseeability, most courts have determined that some duty of care to at least provide a minimal warning should be recognized, notwithstanding the legitimate concerns for doctor-patient confidentiality.</p>
<p id="65cf2565-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Duty to Protect Others from Contagious Diseases.</i></b> In its decision, the court in <i>Emerich</i> relies upon its prior decisions recognizing that when a patient of a medical professional has an illness that is a source of risk to others, the doctor owes a duty of reasonable care to protect those particularly foreseeable to be at risk from the illness. Satisfaction of this duty might be accomplished through some treatment of the patient or through warnings given to the family members.</p>
<p id="65cf2566-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Tarasoff Rule vs. HIPAA Privacy Rights</i>.</b> The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) generally provides strict rules for maintaining the privacy of patient information. Patients believing healthcare providers have violated their privacy may file a complaint directly with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. How do these privacy rights square with the <i>Tarasoff</i> duty to warn third parties about specific threats of serious harm by the patient? Federal regulations offer many exceptions to these privacy rights, including in cases where the health care provider believes “in good faith” that the disclosure is “necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of a person or the public.” The Department of Health and Human Services likewise issued a letter saying that HIPAA permitted <i>Tarasoff</i> warnings to protect both patients and third parties.</p>

<p id="65cf4c7d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We granted this appeal to determine whether a physician has a legal duty to warn a non-patient of the risk of exposure to the source of his patient’s non-contagious disease—Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. The trial court denied the defendant physician’s motion for summary judgment, but granted an interlocutory appeal on the issue of the physician’s legal duty. The Court of Appeals limited the record and held that the facts were insufficient to show that the risk to the non-patient of contracting Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever was such that a legal duty arose on the part of the physician. We disagree and conclude, for the reasons stated herein, that the physician had a legal duty to warn the non-patient of the risk of exposure to the source of the patient’s non-contagious disease.</p>
<p id="65cf4c7e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On July 19, 1986, Elmer Johns went to the emergency room at Methodist Hospital South in Memphis, Tennessee, complaining of headaches, muscle aches, fever, and chills. He was admitted to the hospital under the care and treatment of the defendant, Dr. Chalmers B. Daniel, Jr. Dr. Daniel first saw Johns on July 22, 1986, at which time he ordered the drug Chloramphenicol, which is the drug of choice for a person in the latter stages of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. Johns’ condition rapidly deteriorated, and he died the next day, July 23, 1986. An autopsy was performed, and the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta conclusively confirmed, in late September 1986, that the cause of death was Rocky Mountain Spotted fever. Although Dr. Daniel communicated with Elmer Johns’ wife, Genevieve, during Johns’ treatment, he never advised her of the risks of exposure to Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, or that the disease could have been the cause of Johns’ death.</p>
<p id="65cf4c7f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A week after her husband’s death, on August 1, 1986, Genevieve Johns came to the emergency roam of Baptist Memorial Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, with similar symptoms of chills, fever, mental disorientation, nausea, lung congestion, myalgia, and swelling of the hands. She was admitted to the hospital and treated for Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, but she died three days later, on August 4, 1986, of that disease. It is undisputed that no patient-physician relationship existed between Genevieve Johns and Dr. Daniel.</p>
<p id="65cf4c80-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff, William Jerome Bradshaw, is Genevieve Johns’ son. He filed this suit alleging that the defendant’s negligence in failing to advise Genevieve Johns that her husband died of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, and in failing to warn her of the risk of exposure, proximately caused her death. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action on the grounds that the physician owed Genevieve Johns no legal duty because of the absence of a patient-physician relationship. The trial judge denied the motion.</p>
<p id="65cf4c81-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant physician argues that he owed his patient’s wife no legal duty because first, there was no physician-patient relationship, and second, Rocky <span title="341" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-341">p. 341</span>Mountain Spotted Fever is not a contagious disease and, therefore, there is no duty to warn of the risk of exposure.</p>
<p id="65cf4c82-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We begin our analysis by examining how we determine when a legal duty may be imposed upon one for the benefit of another. While duty was not part of the early English common law jurisprudence of tort liability, it has since become an essential element in negligence cases. No claim for negligence can succeed in the absence of any one of the following elements: (1) a duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff; (2) conduct falling below the applicable standard of care amounting to a breach of that duty; (3) an injury or loss; (4) causation in fact; and (5) proximate, or legal cause. <i>See McClenahan v. Cooley</i>, 806 S.W.2d 767, 774 (Tenn. 1991).</p>
<p id="65cf4c83-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he imposition of a legal duty reflects society’s contemporary policies and social requirements concerning the right of individuals and the general public to be protected from another’s act or conduct. Indeed, it has been stated that “‘duty’ is not sacrosanct in itself, but is only an expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the plaintiff is entitled to protection.” Prosser, §53 at 358.</p>
<p id="65cf4c84-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant contends that the absence of a physician-patient relationship negates the existence of a duty in this case. While it is true that a physician-patient relationship is necessary to the maintenance of a medical malpractice action, it is not necessary for the maintenance of an action based on negligence, and this Court has specifically recognized that a physician may owe a duty to a non-patient third party for injuries caused by the physician’s negligence, if the injuries suffered and the manner in which they occurred were reasonably foreseeable. <i>Wharton Transport Corp. v. Bridges</i>, 606 S.W.2d 521, 526 (Tenn. 1980) (physician owed duty to third party injured by disabled truck driver’s negligence, where the physician was negligent both in his physical examination and certification of the truck driver for the employer).</p>
<p id="65cf4c85-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, we are asked to determine whether a physician has an affirmative duty to warn a patient’s family member about the symptoms and risks of exposure to Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, a non-contagious disease. Insofar as we are able to determine, there is no reported decision from this or any other jurisdiction involving circumstances exactly similar to those presented in this case.</p>
<p id="65cf4c86-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We begin by observing that all persons have a duty to use reasonable care to refrain from conduct that will foreseeably cause injury to others. <i>See Doe v. Linder</i>, 845 S.W.2d 173 (Tenn. 1992<i>)</i>; <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts §314</i> (1964).</p>
<p id="65cf7397-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In determining the existence of a duty, courts have distinguished between action and inaction. Professor Prosser has commented that “the reason for the distinction may be said to lie in the fact that by ‘misfeasance’ the defendant has created a new risk of harm to the plaintiff, while by ‘nonfeasance’ he has at least made his situation no worse, and has merely failed to benefit him by interfering in his affairs.” Prosser, §56 at 373; <i>Lindsey, supra</i>, 689 S.W.2d at 859.</p>
<p id="65cf7398-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because of this reluctance to countenance nonfeasance as a basis of liability, as a general rule, under the common law, one person owed no affirmative duty <span title="342" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-342">p. 342</span>to warn those endangered by the conduct of another. Prosser, §56 at 374; <i>Tarasoff v. Regents of University of California.</i> 551 P.2d 334, 343 (Cal. 1976).</p>
<p id="65cf7399-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To mitigate the harshness of this rule, courts have carved out exceptions for cases in which the defendant stands in some special relationship to either the person who is the source of the danger, or to the person who is foreseeably at risk from the danger. <i>Lindsey</i>, 689 S.W.2d at 859; <i>Tarasoff</i>, 551 P.2d at 343; <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts §315</i> (1964).

<p id="65cf739c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of the most widely known cases applying that principle is <i>Tarasoff</i>, in which the California Supreme Court held that when a psychotherapist determines or, pursuant to the standards of his profession, should determine that his patient presents a serious danger of violence to another, the therapist has an affirmative duty to use reasonable care to protect the intended victim against such danger, and the duty may require the physician to warn the intended victim of the danger. 551 P.2d at 340. The special relationship of the patient to his psychotherapist supported imposition of the affirmative duty to act for the benefit of third persons.</p>
<p id="65cf739d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Decisions of other jurisdictions have employed the same analysis and held that the relationship of a physician to his patient is sufficient to support the duty to exercise reasonable care to protect third persons against foreseeable risks emanating from a patient’s physical illness. Specifically, other courts have recognized that physicians may be liable to persons infected by a patient, if the physician negligently fails to diagnose a contagious disease, or having diagnosed the illness, fails to warn family members or others who are foreseeably at risk of exposure to the disease. <i>See Gammill v. United States</i>, 727 F.2d 950, 954 (10th Cir. 1984<i>)</i> (physician may be found liable for failing to warn a patient’s family, treating attendants, or other persons likely to be exposed to the patient of the nature of the disease and the danger of exposure).</p>
<p id="65cf739e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, in <i>Hofmann</i>, an action was brought against a physician by a child who had contracted tuberculosis as a result of the physician’s negligent failure to diagnose the disease in his patient, the child’s father.

<p id="65cf9ab4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Returning to the facts of this case, first, it is undisputed that there was a physician-patient relationship between Dr. Daniel and Elmer Johns. Second, here, as in the contagious disease context, it is also undisputed that Elmer Johns’ wife, who was residing with him, was at risk of contracting the disease. This is so even though the disease is not contagious in the narrow sense that it can be transmitted from one person to another. Both Dr. Daniel and Dr. Prater, the plaintiff’s expert, testified that family members of patients suffering from Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever are at risk of contracting the disease due to a phenomenon called clustering, which is related to the activity of infected ticks who transmit the disease to humans Dr. Prater also testified that Dr. Daniel negligently failed to diagnose the disease and negligently failed to warn his patient’s wife, Genevieve Johns, of her risk of exposure to the source of disease. Dr. Daniel’s expert disputed these conclusions, but Dr. Daniel conceded there is a medical duty to inform the family when there is a diagnosis of the disease. Thus, this case is analogous to the <i>Tarasoff</i> line of cases adopting a duty to warn of danger and the contagious disease cases adopting a comparable duty to warn. Here, as in those cases, there was a foreseeable risk of harm to an identifiable third party, and the reasons supporting the recognition of the duty to warn are equally compelling here.</p>
<p id="65cf9ab5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We, therefore, conclude that the existence of the physician-patient relationship is sufficient to impose upon a physician an affirmative duty to warn identifiable third persons in the patient’s immediate family against foreseeable risks emanating from a patient’s illness. Accordingly, we hold that under the factual circumstances of this case, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, the defendant physician had a duty to warn his <span title="344" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-344">p. 344</span>patient’s wife of the risk to her of contracting Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, when he knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known, that his patient was suffering from the disease. Our holding here is necessarily limited to the conclusion that the defendant physician owed Genevieve Johns a legal duty. We express no opinion on the other elements which would be required to establish a cause of action for common-law negligence in this case.</p>
<p id="65cf9ab6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals granting the defendant’s motion for summary judgment is reversed, and this cause is remanded to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

<p id="65cf9ab9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Source of Duty.</i></b> The court mentions the need for the special relationship in order to create an affirmative duty to act. What is the exact special relationship utilized by the court in <i>Bradshaw</i> to create this obligation on the part of the doctor? Is this case analogous to <i>Tarasoff</i> and the contagious disease cases? There is arguably less foreseeability of harm here than in <i>Tarasoff</i> because, in this instance, there is no threat of anyone intending to harm the plaintiff. Further, can you say in the <i>Bradshaw</i> case that the doctor had a special relationship with the source of the harm? Was this a case with a contagious disease? If not, it seems debatable that a duty of care should arise, absent any special relationship between the doctor and either the victim or the source of the victim’s harm.</p>

<p id="65cfc1d4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is a wrongful death action instituted by Larry and Clifford Clark against Otis Engineering Corporation after the Clarks’ wives were killed in an automobile accident involving an Otis employee, Robert Matheson. At the time of the accident Matheson was not in the course of his employment. The trial court granted Otis’ motion for summary judgment. The court of appeals reversed and remanded the cause for trial, holding there were genuine issues of fact. We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>
<p id="65cfc1d5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two questions are presented. First, does the law impose any duty upon Otis under the evidence as developed? Secondly, does such evidence give rise to any genuine issues of material fact?</p>
<p id="65cfc1d6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Matheson worked the evening shift at Otis’ Carrollton plant. He had a history of drinking on the job, and was intoxicated on the night of the accident. At his dinner break that night and on other occasions that day he went to the parking lot, where he allegedly consumed alcoholic beverages in his automobile. Donald Roy was Matheson’s supervisor and Rennie Pyle was a co-worker who assisted Matheson on occasion. Pyle testified that he knew of Matheson’s drinking problems and that he told Roy on the day of the accident that Matheson was not acting right, was not coordinated, was slurring his words, and that “we need to get him off the machines.” David Sartain, a fellow worker, testified that Matheson was either sick or drinking, was getting worse, “his complexion was blue and like he was sick,” and that he was weaving and bobbing on his stool and about to fall into his machine. The supervisor testified that he observed Matheson’s condition and was aware that other employees believed he should be removed from the machine. When Matheson returned from his dinner break, Roy suggested that he should go home. Roy, as he escorted Matheson to the company’s parking lot, asked if he was all right and if he could make it home, and Matheson answered that he could. Thirty minutes later, some three miles away from the plant, the fatal accident occurred.</p>
<p id="65cfe8e7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dr. Charles S. Petty, the medical examiner, testified that Matheson had a blood alcohol content of 0.268% which indicated he had ingested a substantial quantity of alcohol, an amount representing some sixteen to eighteen cocktails if consumed over a period of one hour, or twenty to twenty-five cocktails if consumed over a period of two hours. The doctor stated that persons working around Matheson would undoubtedly have known of his condition, expressing his opinion that one hundred percent of persons with that much alcohol exhibit signs of intoxication observable to the average person.</p>
<p id="65cfe8e8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Matheson’s extreme state of intoxication was well known to his supervisor and fellow workers. The testimony indicated the supervisor knew Matheson was in no condition to drive home safely that night. When some night shift employees came to work around 10:30 p.m. and remarked there had been an accident <span title="346" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-346">p. 346</span>on Belt Line Road, Roy immediately suspected Matheson was involved. Roy testified he feared Matheson might have an accident, knowing that Matheson had to drive on heavily traveled Belt Line Road to reach home. Upon hearing of the accident, Roy, acting on a hunch, voluntarily went to the police station to see if Matheson was involved.</p>
<p id="65cfe8e9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Clarks contend that under the facts in this case Otis sent home, in the middle of his shift, an employee whom it knew to be intoxicated. They aver this was an affirmative act which imposed a duty on Otis to act in a non-negligent manner. <i>Cf. Osuna v. Southern Pacific Railroad</i>, 641 S.W.2d 229 (Tex. 1982). This action by Otis subjected Matheson and other motorists to the dangers of an accident on the highway.</p>
<p id="65cfe8ea-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Clarks further contend that Otis maintained a nurses’ station on the premises for the benefit of ill or disabled employees. Although Otis provided this facility to aid employees in situations such as this, the supervisor chose instead to accompany Matheson to the parking lot and send him out on the highway, even though he had foreseen the possibility of an accident. The Clarks likewise maintain that Roy had other alternatives which the jury could find to be more reasonable, such as taking Matheson to the nurses’ station, giving him a ride home, or calling a taxi, the police, or Matheson’s wife. The Clarks state that fact questions exist as to whether Otis was negligent in sending Matheson home in an obviously intoxicated condition and whether such negligence was a proximate cause of the Clarks’ deaths.</p>
<p id="65cfe8eb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Otis’ motion for summary judgment was granted on the basis that as a matter of law Otis owed no duty to the Clarks. In order to establish tort liability, a plaintiff must initially prove the existence and breach of a duty owed to him by the defendant. <i>Abalos v. Oil Development Co. of Texas</i>, 544 S.W.2d 627, 631 (Tex. 1976). As a general rule, one person is under no duty to control the conduct of another, <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> §315 (1965), even if he has the practical ability to exercise such control. <i>Trammell v. Ramey</i>, 329 S.W.2d 153 (Ark. 1959). Yet, certain relationships do impose, as a matter of law, certain duties upon parties. <i>See e.g., Restatement (Second)</i> §§316-20. For instance, the master-servant relationship may give rise to a duty on the part of the master to control the conduct of his servants outside the scope of employment. This duty, however, is a narrow one. Ordinarily, the employer is liable only for the off-duty torts of his employees which are committed on the employer’s premises or with the employer’s chattels. <i>Restatement (Second)</i> §317.</p>
<p id="65cfe8ec-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Though the decisional law of this State has yet to address the precise issues presented by this case, factors which should be considered in determining whether the law should impose a duty are the risk, foreseeability, and likelihood of injury weighed against the social utility of the actor’s conduct, the magnitude of the burden of guarding against the injury and consequences of placing that burden on the employer. <i>See Robertson v. LeMaster</i>, 301 S.E.2d 563 (W. Va. 1983); <i>Turner v. Grier</i>, 608 P.2d 356 (Colo. 1979).</p>
<p id="65cfe8ed-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While a person is generally under no legal duty to come to the aid of another in distress, he is under a duty to avoid any affirmative act which might worsen <span title="347" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-347">p. 347</span>the situation. <i>See</i> W. Prosser, <i>The Law of Torts</i> §56 at 343 (4th ed. 1971). One who voluntarily enters an affirmative course of action affecting the interests of another is regarded as assuming a duty to act and must do so with reasonable care. <i>Colonial Savings Ass’n v. Taylor</i>, 544 S.W.2d 116 (Tex. 1976); <i>Fox v. Dallas Hotel Co.</i>, 240 S.W. 517 (1922); <i>see</i> W. Prosser, <i>supra</i>, §56.</p>
<p id="65cfe8ee-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Otis contends that, at worst, its conduct amounted to nonfeasance and under established law it owed no duty to the Clarks’ respective wives. Otis further says that by imposing liability for the acts of its intoxicated employee, this Court would be judicially creating “dram shop” liability. We disagree. This is not a “dram shop” case. If a duty is to be imposed on Otis it would not be based on the <i>mere knowledge</i> of Matheson’s intoxication, but would be based on additional factors.</p>
<p id="65cfe8ef-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Traditional tort analysis has long drawn a distinction between action and inaction in defining the scope of duty. Dean Prosser attributes this distinction to the early common law courts’ preoccupation with “more flagrant forms of misbehavior [rather than] with one who merely did nothing, even though another might suffer harm because of his omission to act.” W. Prosser, <i>supra</i>, at 338. However, although courts have been slow to recognize liability for nonfeasance, “during the last century, liability for ‘nonfeasance’ has been extended still further to a limited group of relations, in which custom, public sentiment and views of social policy have led the courts to find a duty of affirmative action.” <i>Id.</i> at 339. Be that as it may, we do not view this as a case of employer nonfeasance.</p>
<p id="65cfe8f0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What we must decide is if changing social standards and increasing complexities of human relationships in today’s society justify imposing a duty upon an employer to act reasonably when he exercises control over his servants. Even though courts have been reluctant to hold an employer liable for the off-duty torts of an employee, “as between an entirely innocent plaintiff and a defendant who admittedly has departed from the social standard of conduct, if only toward one individual, who should bear the loss?” W. Prosser, <i>supra</i>, at 257. Dean Prosser additionally observed that “there is nothing sacred about ‘duty,’ which is nothing more than a word, and a very indefinite one, with which we state our conclusion.” <i>Id.</i></p>
<p id="65cfe8f1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During this year, we have taken a step toward changing our concept of duty in premises cases. In <i>Corbin v. Safeway Stores, Inc.</i>, 648 S.W.2d 292 (Tex. 1983), we held that a store owner has a duty to guard against slips and falls if he has actual or constructive knowledge of a dangerous condition and it is foreseeable a fall would occur. We now leave to the jury exclusive determination of the matter if evidence exists that the store owner had the requisite knowledge of the dangerous premises condition. No longer do we require knowledge of the specific object. Following <i>Corbin</i>, why should we be reluctant to impose a duty on Otis? As Dean Prosser has observed, “changing social conditions lead constantly to the recognition of new duties. No better general statement can be made, than the courts will find a duty where, in general, reasonable men would recognize it and agree that it exists.” W. Prosser, <i>supra</i>, at 327. If, as Prosser asserts should be <span title="348" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-348">p. 348</span>done, we change concepts of duty as changing social conditions occur, then this case presents the Court with the opportunity to conform our conception of duty to what society demands.</p>
<p id="65cfe8f2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Several recent cases in other jurisdictions have extended concepts of duty in the area of employer liability. In <i>Leppke v. Segura</i>, 632 P.2d 1057 (Colo. App. 1981), a tavern owner refused to serve an intoxicated man; however, a tavern employee later jump-started the man’s car. Subsequently, the intoxicated man caused a fatal automobile accident. The Colorado court, in reversing a summary judgment, held that the employee’s affirmative action was enough to raise an issue of breach of duty even though there was no relationship between the defendant and the intoxicated driver. <i>Id.</i> at 1059.</p>
<p id="65cfe8f3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An employer was held liable for injuries sustained by third parties in an accident caused by its intoxicated employee in <i>Brockett v. Kitchen Boyd Motor Co.</i>, 264 Cal. App. 2d 69, 70 Cal. Rptr. 136 (1968). The employee, Huff, became intoxicated at a Christmas party given by the motor company. Although Huff was “grossly intoxicated,” a representative of the company placed him in his automobile and directed him to drive home. The court recognized that the supplying of alcohol does not ordinarily make the supplier liable to an injured third party, but the affirmative acts of placing him in his car and directing him to drive home imposed a duty on the company to exercise reasonable care. 70 Cal. Rptr. at 139.</p>
<p id="65cfe8f4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recently, the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia rendered its opinion in <i>Robertson v. LeMaster</i>, 301 S.E.2d 563 (W. Va. 1983). In that case, LeMaster’s employer, The Norfolk and Western Railway Company, had required LeMaster to work twenty-seven consecutive hours to remove debris and repair a track damaged by a train derailment. After many complaints by LeMaster that he was tired and wanted to go home, LeMaster’s foreman permitted him to do so. LeMaster lived some fifty miles from his place of work, and while driving his own car home, fell asleep and was involved in a collision with Robertson, causing injuries to Robertson. The West Virginia court recognized that the railroad company owed no duty to control an employee acting outside of the scope of employment, but stated that such was not the issue in the case, saying “rather it is whether the appellee’s conduct prior to the accident created a foreseeable risk of harm.” <i>Id.</i> at 567. The court concluded that requiring LeMaster to work such long hours and then setting him loose upon the highway in an obviously exhausted condition was sufficient to sustain a cause of action against the railroad. We are persuaded by the logic of the holdings in these three cases.</p>
<p id="65cfe8f5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Therefore, the standard of duty that we now adopt for this and all other cases currently in the judicial process, is: when, because of an employee’s incapacity, an employer exercises control over the employee, the employer has a duty to take such action as a reasonably prudent employer under the same or similar circumstances would take to prevent the employee from causing an unreasonable risk of harm to others. Such a duty may be analogized to cases in which a defendant can exercise some measure of reasonable control over a dangerous person when there is a recognizable great danger of harm to <span title="349" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-349">p. 349</span>third persons. <i>See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Torts</i>, §319; W. Prosser, <i>supra</i>, at 350. Additionally, we adopt the rule from cases in this Restatement area that the duty of the employer or one who can exercise charge over a dangerous person is not an absolute duty to insure safety, but requires only reasonable care. <i>See Missouri, K. &amp; T. Ry. Co. of Texas v. Wood</i>, 95 Tex. 223, 66 S.W. 449 (1902); <i>Sylvester v. Northwestern Hospital of Minneapolis</i>, 236 Minn. 384, 53 N.W.2d 17 (1952).</p>
<p id="65d01006-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Therefore, the trier of fact in this case should be left free to decide whether Otis acted as a reasonable and prudent employer considering the following factors: the availability of the nurses’ aid station, a possible phone call to Mrs. Matheson, having another employee drive Matheson home, dismissing Matheson early rather than terminating his employment, and the foreseeable consequences of Matheson’s driving upon a public street in his stuporous condition. As summary judgment proof clearly raises all of these factors questioning the reasonableness of Otis’ conduct, a fact issue is present and summary judgment was improper.</p>
<p id="65d01007-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and remand to the trial court for determination of the issues.</p>

<p id="65d0100a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Employer Liability for Torts of Employees.</i></b> In Chapter 9, Apportionment, we will study the doctrine of <i>vicarious liability</i>, by which a master is deemed liable based upon its association with an employee who commits a tort during her course and scope of employment. Such liability is premised solely upon the fault of the employee rather than any breach of duty by the employer. One difficulty the plaintiffs faced in <i>Otis</i> was that the tort of the drunk employee was committed “off the clock.” He had left the course and scope of employment prior to causing the accident. Therefore, plaintiffs needed to establish negligent conduct by the employer and, of course, this necessitated a determination that the employer owed a duty to prevent this accident from occurring.</p>
<p id="65d0100b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Duty to Control Others.</i></b> The Restatement referred to by the court above acknowledges the many court decisions imposing a duty upon certain actors to act with reasonable care when they are responsible for certain people. Specifically, §§316-318 imposes a duty of reasonable care upon actors with regard to their minor children, dangerous persons in their custody, employees, and those using their property to conduct certain activities. In view of where and when the traffic accident took place in the foregoing case, do these provisions from the Restatement clearly resolve the issue of duty in the foregoing case? If the defendant’s employee was beyond their control at the time of the accident, exactly what is the source of the duty of reasonable care? Consider the dichotomy presented at the beginning of this chapter between malfeasance and nonfeasance. While the defendant may have wanted to portray the plaintiff’s claim as alleging a failure to act, the court takes the opposite <span title="350" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-350">p. 350</span>view—that the defendant, while acting to remove a problem from its own worksite, instead placed that danger on the public roads of North Dallas.</p>

<p id="65d0100e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Due to special relationships, the common law idea that one does not have an obligation to undertake action for the protection of others finds an exception. With regard to health care workers, the law recognizes that the combination of the special relationship between the doctor and the patient can provide an obligation to act for the benefit of third parties at risk from the patient. When the patient has transmitted a specific serious threat to intentionally injure a third party, most courts have recognized at least a duty to provide some reasonable warning. And in the contagious disease context, courts have likewise recognized that the patient presents a highly foreseeable risk of harm to other nearby health care workers and family members, which compels action for their protection. The employer-employee relationship is likewise sufficient to create an obligation to supervise employees for the protection of others. This is relatively easy to recognize when the employee is at work or at least using company property (e.g., a company car). But when the employee is not at work, finding a source of duty on the part of the employer is much more difficult. While the employee would be liable for his own torts, when does the employer separately breach a duty? Once the employee departs from work, generally the duty to supervise ends. But the careful and creative lawyer can sometimes create a persuasive argument that, while the consequences of the employer’s negligence might be manifest “off the clock,” the employer may have been careless while the employee was still under its control. Both the health care and the employer scenarios involve special relationships and foreseeable harms to others that combine to change the default no-duty rule to one requiring action.</p>

<p id="65d01011-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Thus far we have encountered the tort dichotomy between malfeasance (act) and nonfeasance (failure to act) and seen different relationships that change the default rules regarding duty. In this section we will find that courts have doubts about whether certain duties of care should exist to prevent <i>certain types of harm</i> from being suffered. We will first deal with instances where the defendant’s negligence causes no immediate physical consequences to the plaintiff, <span title="351" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-351">p. 351</span>but instead disturbs his emotional tranquility. This emotional injury may or may not have secondary physical consequences, but the non-physical accidental “touching” of the mind raises significant concerns for courts. The second area we will introduce is analogous—where the plaintiff is not physically impacted in any way by the negligence but instead suffers economic losses (i.e., lost profits). Finally, we will delve into an area some courts say is better left to philosophers and theologians rather than the courts. Entering the arena of so-called “wrongful life” claims, we will see how courts react to plaintiffs who argue that they wished they had never been born and blame the defendant for their existence. We will simultaneously consider the related claims for wrongful birth and wrongful pregnancy. In each area, think about what it is about the nature of the claimed harm that causes courts to pause at the question of duty.</p>

<p id="65d03724-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">At common law, courts have long permitted recovery of claimed emotional injuries that are secondary to physical harms. When a defendant’s negligence causes a plaintiff to lose a limb, there has never been any serious difficulty recognizing that plaintiff’s right to recover for the emotional consequences of the physical harm. This became known as the “<i>Impact Rule</i>”—that so long as some physical injury has occurred, emotional distress was a recoverable element of damages. Eventually this rule of recovery became stretched enough so that any physical touching—whether truly harmful or not—could support a claim for negligently inflicted emotional distress. In the following <i>Robb</i> case, the court recognizes the absurdity of this rule and transitions to a new rule for recognition of negligently inflicted emotional distress—the “<i>Zone of Danger</i>” rule. Next, in the <i>Dillon</i> case, we will see a subsequent court question the wisdom behind the zone of danger rule and transition to yet another rule—the so-called “Dillon rule of foreseeability.” Whether following the <i>impact</i>, <i>zone of danger</i>, or <i>Dillon</i> rules, each of these cases grapple with when to recognize a “bystander” claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress when the plaintiff is not physically involved in an accident but still seeks compensation for her emotional injuries. In the final case in this section, <i>Kerr</i>, the court will consider a broader question—outside of the bystander area, will courts generally recognize any duty not to negligently cause emotional distress? Particularly in this area, courts worry about the ramifications of making it too easy for an emotionally upset plaintiff to sue. Ask yourself which rule, each of which is still utilized today by various courts, strikes the most effective balance between compensating victims for true harm without turning everyone into a tortfeasor for hurting others’ feelings.</p>

<p id="65d05e3d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question before us for decision is this: May the plaintiff recover for the physical consequences of fright caused by the negligence of the defendant, the plaintiff being within the immediate zone of physical danger created by such negligence, although there was no contemporaneous bodily impact?</p>
<p id="65d05e3e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Considering the record in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the facts may be thus summarized:</p>
<p id="65d05e3f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A private lane leading to the home of the plaintiff, Dixie B. Robb, was intersected by a railroad right-of-way leased to the defendant, The Pennsylvania Railroad Company. On March 11, 1961, the plaintiff was driving an automobile up the lane toward her home when the vehicle stalled at the railroad grade crossing. A rut about a foot deep had been negligently permitted by the defendant to form at the crossing. The rear wheels of the automobile lodged in the rut and, although the plaintiff tried to move the vehicle for several minutes, she was unable to do so. While thus engaged in attempting to move the vehicle, the plaintiff saw the defendant’s train bearing down upon her. With only seconds to spare, she jumped from the stalled vehicle and fled for her life. Immediately thereafter, the locomotive collided with the vehicle, hurled it into the air and demolished it. The plaintiff was standing within a few feet of the track when the collision occurred and her face was covered with train soot and dirt. However—and this is the nub of the problem—she was not touched by the train; there was no bodily impact; and she suffered no contemporaneous physical injury. Nevertheless, the plaintiff was greatly frightened and emotionally disturbed by the accident as the result of which she sustained shock to her nervous system. The fright and nervous shock resulted in physical injuries including cessation of lactation which interfered with the plaintiff’s ability to nurse and otherwise care for her infant child. Her nervous and general physical condition resulting from the accident also obliged the plaintiff to abandon a horse breeding business and an article which she had been engaged to write for substantial compensation.</p>
<p id="65d05e40-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant moved for summary judgment taking the position that, assuming the defendant’s negligence and its proximate causation of the plaintiff’s fright and nervous shock, she may not recover because there was no “impact” and contemporaneous physical injury. The trial judge agreed and granted summary judgment in the defendant’s favor, stating: “In spite of a modern trend to the contrary in other jurisdictions, I feel compelled to follow the ‘impact theory’ in this matter by reason of well established precedents in this State.”</p>
<span title="353" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-353">p. 353</span>
<p id="65d05e41-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question is still an open one in this State. Two reported Delaware cases and one unreported case border upon the field of inquiry, but none really enter it.</p>
<p id="65d05e42-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is sharp diversity of judicial opinion as to the right to recover for the physical consequences of fright in the absence of an impact and contemporaneous physical injury….</p>
<p id="65d05e43-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The impact rule was established in America by the leading cases of <i>Ewing v. Pittsburgh, etc. R. Co.</i>, 23 A. 340 (Pa. 1892); <i>Mitchell v. Rochester R. Co.</i>, 45 N.E. 354 (N.Y. 1896); and <i>Spade v. Lynn &amp; Boston R. Co.</i>, 47 N.E. 88 (Mass. 1897). [T]he trend favoring the impact rule…attained a head-start in America by reason of the <i>Ewing</i>, <i>Mitchell</i> and <i>Spade</i> cases and it spread to numerous other jurisdictions under the influence of those cases.</p>
<p id="65d05e44-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The impact rule is based, generally speaking, upon three propositions expounded in the <i>Mitchell</i> and <i>Spade</i> cases:</p>
<p id="65d05e45-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">1) It is stated that since fright alone does not give rise to a cause of action, the consequences of fright will not give rise to a cause of action. This is now generally recognized to be a non-sequitur, want of damage being recognized as the reason that negligence causing mere fright is not actionable. It is now generally agreed, even in jurisdictions which have adopted the impact rule, that the gist of the action is the injury flowing from the negligence, whether operating through the medium of physical impact or nervous shock.</p>
<p id="65d05e46-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">2) It is stated that the physical consequences of fright are too remote and that the requisite causal connection is unprovable. The fallacies of this ground of the impact rule, viewed in the light of growing medical knowledge, were well stated by Chief Justice Maltbie in <i>Orlo v. Connecticut Co.</i>, 21 A.2d 402 (Conn. 1941). It was there pointed out that the early difficulty in tracing a resulting injury back through fright or nervous shock has been minimized by the advance of medical science; and that the line of cases permitting recovery for serious injuries resulting from fright, where there has been but a trivial impact in itself causing little or no injury, demonstrate that there is no insuperable difficulty in tracing causal connection between the wrongdoing and the injury via the fright.</p>
<p id="65d08557-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">3) It is stated that public policy and expediency demand that there be no recovery for the physical consequences of fright in the absence of a contemporaneous physical injury. In recent years, this has become the principal reason for denying recovery on the basis of the impact rule. In support of this argument, it is said that fright is a subjective state of mind, difficult to evaluate, and of such nature that proof by the claimant is too easy and disproof by the party charged too difficult, thus making it unsafe as a practical matter for the law to deal with such claims. This school of thought concludes that to permit recovery in such cases would open a “Pandora’s Box” of fictitious and fraudulent claims involving speculative and conjectural damages with which the law and medical science cannot justly cope.</p>
<p id="65d08558-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is our opinion that the reasons for rejecting the impact rule far outweigh the reasons which have been advanced in its support.</p>
<span title="354" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-354">p. 354</span>
<p id="65d08559-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The cause of action and proximate cause grounds for the rule have been discredited in the very jurisdictions which first gave them credence. As stated by Holmes, C.J., for the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, the <i>Spade</i> decision did not result from “a logical deduction from the general principles of liability in tort, but as a limitation of those principles upon purely practical grounds.” <i>Smith v. Postal Telegraph Cable Co.</i>, 55 N.E. 380 (Mass. 1899). Or, as stated by the same eminent jurist on another occasion, he deemed exemption from such damages to be “an arbitrary exception, based upon a notion of what is practicable.” <i>Homans v. Boston Elevated R. Co.</i>, 62 N.E. 737 (Mass. 1902). And, referring to the <i>Mitchell</i> case and the grounds here under consideration, Lehman, J., speaking for the New York Court of Appeals, stated: “Its conclusions cannot be tested by pure logic. The court recognized that its views of public policy to some extent dictated its decision,” <i>Comstock v. Wilson, supra.</i></p>
<p id="65d0855a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If more were needed to warrant a declination to follow the cause of action and the proximate cause arguments, reference to the fictional and mechanical ends to which the impact rule has been carried would suffice for the purpose. The most trivial bodily contact, itself causing little or no injury, has been considered sufficient to take a case out of the rule and permit recovery for serious physical injuries resulting from the accompanying fright. Token impact sufficient to satisfy the rule has been held to be a slight bump against the seat, dust in the eyes, inhalation of smoke, a trifling burn, jostling in an automobile, indeed any degree of physical impact, however slight.</p>
<p id="65d0855b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This leaves the public policy or expediency ground to support the impact rule. We think that ground untenable.</p>
<p id="65d0855c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is the duty of the courts to afford a remedy and redress for every substantial wrong. Part of our basic law is the mandate that “every man for an injury done him in his…person…shall have remedy by the due course of law.…” Del. Const. Art. 1, Sec. 9, Del. C. Ann. Neither volume of cases, nor danger of fraudulent claims, nor difficulty of proof, will relieve the courts of their obligation in this regard. None of these problems are insuperable. Statistics fail to show that there has been a “flood” of such cases in those jurisdictions in which recovery is allowed; but if there be increased litigation, the courts must willingly cope with the task. As to the danger of illusory and fictional claims, this is not a new problem; our courts deal constantly with claims for pain and suffering based upon subjective symptoms only; and the courts and the medical profession have been found equal to the danger. Fraudulent claims may be feigned in a slight-impact case as well as in a no-impact case. Likewise, the problems of adequacy of proof, for the avoidance of speculative and conjectural damages, are common to personal injury cases generally and are surmountable, being satisfactorily solved by our courts in case after case.</p>
<p id="65d0855d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are unwilling to accept a rule, or an expediency argument in support thereof, which results in the denial of a logical legal right and remedy in all cases because in some a fictitious injury may be urged or a difficult problem of the proof or disproof of speculative damage may be presented. Justice is not best served, we think, when compensation is denied to one who has suffered injury <span title="355" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-355">p. 355</span>through the negligence of another merely because of the possibility of encouraging fictitious claims or speculative damages in other cases. Public policy requires the courts, with the aid of the legal and medical professions, to find ways and means to solve satisfactorily the problems thus presented-not expedient ways to avoid them. We recognize that “[expediency] may tip the scales when arguments are nicely balanced,” <i>Woolford Realty Co. v. Rose</i>, 286 U.S. 319, 330; but, in our view, such nice balance no longer exists as to the subject matter.</p>
<p id="65d0855e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, we decline to adopt the impact rule, as urged by the defendant in this cause. The impact rule “is almost certainly destined for ultimate extinction, although it displays surprising vitality, and the process may not be a rapid one. [I]t seems clear that the courts which deny all remedy in such cases are fighting a rearguard action.” Prosser on Torts (3d Ed.) pp. 351-352.</p>
<p id="65d0855f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We hold, therefore, that where negligence proximately caused fright, in one within the immediate area of physical danger from that negligence, which in turn produced physical consequences such as would be elements of damage if a bodily injury had been suffered, the injured party is entitled to recover under an application of the prevailing principles of law as to negligence and proximate causation. Otherwise stated, where results, which are regarded as proper elements of recovery as a consequence of physical injury, are proximately caused by fright due to negligence, recovery by one in the immediate zone of physical risk should be permitted.</p>
<p id="65d08560-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This view has the general approval of the writers on the subject and is now distinctly the majority rule. We are satisfied that it is the better rule, supported by reason, logic and fairness.</p>
<p id="65d08561-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude, therefore, that the Superior Court erred in the instant case in holding that the plaintiff’s right to recover is barred by the impact rule. The plaintiff claims physical injuries resulting from fright proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant. She should have the opportunity to prove such injuries and to recover therefor if she succeeds. The summary judgment granted in favor of the defendant must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>

<div class="epub-heading cc-font-xlarge left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="65d0ac73-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b">NOTES AND PROBLEMS</p></h3></div>
<p id="65d0ac74-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Dire Prediction for Impact Rule Not Realized.</i></b> The <i>Robb</i> court found the pragmatic principles undergirding the impact rule untenable and predicted the demise of that rule. What were the rationales and how effectively did the court repudiate them? By the way, under the facts of <i>Robb</i>, was there any argument that the plaintiff could have recovered without a new doctrinal switch by the court? Remember factually what the plaintiff experienced in the near miss and how the court referenced what types of “trivial” contact could satisfy the impact rule. Notwithstanding the court’s prediction, the impact rule lives on to this day being employed by multiple courts in different jurisdictions. It is the <span title="356" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-356">p. 356</span>distinct minority rule but it still survives. Do you see any advantage, conceptual or pragmatic, to the impact rule over the zone of danger rule adopted in <i>Robb</i>?</p>
<p id="65d0ac75-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Requirement for Physical Manifestation of Emotional Distress.</i></b> The <i>Robb</i> court permits recovery where the negligence of the defendant does not even touch the plaintiff physically but affects the plaintiff emotionally—yet only where the emotional distress results in some physical consequences. Why limit recovery for emotional distress in this way? Do you see how even some courts embracing the newer zone of danger rule are still uncomfortable with recognizing a claim for negligently caused emotional distress? In what way does the requirement of physical consequences help courts to alleviate some of their concerns with fraudulent and fictitious claims? Is this any more effective than the old impact rule?</p>
<p id="65d0ac76-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Zone of Danger.</i></b> In terms of physical space, the zone of danger increases the potential for a plaintiff to recover for emotional distress—rather than demanding that the plaintiff be close enough to the calamity caused by defendant’s negligence to be physically touched, now it is sufficient for the plaintiff to be merely close enough to have a legitimate fear for their own safety. How close the plaintiff must be necessarily depends upon the circumstances of the accident. In the case of a train wreck, plaintiff was surely within the zone of danger in <i>Robb</i>, as she barely escaped her car before disaster struck.</p>
<p id="65d0ac77-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>No Emotional Distress Recovery for Property Loss.</i></b> The <i>Robb</i> court failed to acknowledge that the plaintiff suffered the loss of her vehicle due to the defendant railway’s negligence. There was no doubt about the plaintiff’s entitlement to recover for the negligently caused property loss. Could she have claimed to suffer emotional distress from the loss of her car? Courts have consistently refused to recognize such a claim. <i>See</i> e.g., Kleinke v. Farmers Cooperative Supply &amp; Shipping, 549 N.W.2d 714 (Wis. 1996) (“[I]t is unlikely that a plaintiff could ever recover for the emotional distress caused by negligent damage to his or her property”). While emotional distress recovery can be a component of damages for physical injuries to oneself, courts do not allow such claims to be tacked onto a property loss claim. No matter how much you like your Camaro, it can be easily replaced.</p>

<p id="65d0d391-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That the courts should allow recovery to a mother who suffers emotional trauma and physical injury from witnessing the infliction of death or injury to her child for which the tortfeasor is liable in negligence would appear to be a compelling proposition. As Prosser points out, “All ordinary human feelings are in favor of her [the mother’s] action against the negligent defendant. If a duty to her requires that she herself be in some recognizable danger, then it has properly been said that when a child is endangered, it is not beyond contemplation that its mother will be somewhere in the vicinity, and will suffer serious shock.” Prosser, Law of Torts (3d ed. 1964) p. 353.</p>
<p id="65d0d392-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nevertheless, past American decisions have barred the mother’s recovery. Refusing the mother the right to take her case to the jury, these courts ground their position on an alleged absence of a required “duty” of due care of the tortfeasor to the mother. Duty, in turn, they state, must express public policy; the imposition of duty here would work disaster because it would invite fraudulent claims and it would involve the courts in the hopeless task of defining the extent of the tortfeasor’s liability. In substance, they say, definition of liability being impossible, denial of liability is the only realistic alternative.</p>
<p id="65d0d393-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have concluded that neither of the feared dangers excuses the frustration of the natural justice upon which the mother’s claim rests. We shall point out that in the past we have rejected the argument that we should deny recovery upon a legitimate claim because other fraudulent ones may be urged. We shall further explain that the alleged inability to fix definitions for recovery on the different facts of future cases does not justify the denial of recovery on the specific facts of the instant case; in any event, proper guidelines can indicate the extent of liability for such future cases.</p>
<p id="65d0d394-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the instant case plaintiff’s first cause of action alleged that on or about September 27, 1964, defendant drove his automobile in a southerly direction on Bluegrass Road near its intersection with Clover Lane in the County of Sacramento, and at that time plaintiff’s infant daughter, Erin Lee Dillon, lawfully crossed Bluegrass Road.

Dillon, “was in close proximity to the…collision and personally witnessed said collision.” She <span title="358" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-358">p. 358</span>further alleged that “because of the negligence of defendants…and as a proximate cause [<i>sic</i>] thereof plaintiff…sustained great emotional disturbance and shock and injury to her nervous system” which caused her great physical and mental pain and suffering.</p>
<p id="65d0d396-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff’s third cause of action alleged that Cheryl Dillon, another infant daughter, was “in close proximity to the…collision and personally witnessed said collision.” Because of the negligence, Cheryl Dillon “sustained great emotional disturbance and shock and injury to her nervous system” which caused her great physical and mental pain and suffering.</p>
<p id="65d0d397-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On December 22, 1965, defendant, after he had filed his answer, moved for judgment on the pleadings, contending that [no cause of action for emotional distress had been stated from the mere witnessing of the accident]. Even where a child, sister or spouse is the object of the plaintiff’s apprehension no cause of action is stated unless the complaint alleges that the plaintiff suffered emotional distress, fright or shock as a result of fear for his own safety. The [trial] court granted a judgment on the pleadings against the mother’s count, the second cause of action, and denied it as to the sister’s count, the third cause of action. Margery M. Dillon, the mother, appealed from that judgment.</p>
<p id="65d0d398-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thereafter, on January 26, further proceedings took place as to the third cause of action, Cheryl Dillon’s claim for emotional trauma from witnessing her sister’s death while “watching her sister lawfully cross Bluegrass Road.” [Defendant had also moved for summary judgment as to the sister’s claim for emotional distress. There was some evidence, though disputed, that the sister was on the curb and within the zone of danger.]</p>
<p id="65d0d399-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court apparently sustained the motion for judgment on the pleadings on the second cause as to the mother because she was not within the zone of danger and denied that motion as to the third cause involving Cheryl because of the possibility that she was within such zone of danger or feared for her own safety. Thus we have before us a case that dramatically illustrates the difference in result [from the zone of danger rule] because the complaint here presents the claim of the emotionally traumatized mother, who admittedly was <i>not</i> within the zone of danger, as contrasted with that of the sister, who <i>may have been</i> within it. The case thus illustrates the fallacy of the rule that would deny recovery in the one situation and grant it in the other. In the first place, we can hardly justify relief to the sister for trauma which she suffered upon apprehension of the child’s death and yet deny it to the mother merely because of a happenstance that the sister was some few yards closer to the accident. The instant case exposes the hopeless artificiality of the zone-of-danger rule. In the second place, to rest upon the zone-of-danger rule when we have rejected the impact rule becomes even less defensible. We have, indeed, held that impact is not necessary for recovery. The zone-of-danger concept must, then, inevitably collapse because the only reason for the requirement of presence in that zone lies in the fact that one within it will fear the danger of <i>impact</i>. At the threshold, then, we point to the incongruity of the rules upon which any rejection of plaintiff’s recovery must rest.</p>

<p id="65d0d39a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We turn then to an analysis of the concept of duty, which, as we have stated, has furnished the ground for the rejection of such claims as the instant one. Normally the simple facts of plaintiff’s complaint would establish a cause of action: the complaint alleges that defendant drove his car (1) negligently, as a (2) proximate result of which plaintiff suffered (3) physical injury. Proof of these facts to a jury leads to recovery in damages; indeed, such a showing represents a classic example of the type of accident with which the law of negligence has been designed to deal.</p>
<p id="65d0d39b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The assertion that liability must nevertheless be denied because defendant bears no “duty” to plaintiff “begs the essential question—whether the plaintiff’s interests are entitled to legal protection against the defendant’s conduct…. It [duty] is a shorthand statement of a conclusion, rather than an aid to analysis in itself…. But it should be recognized that ‘duty’ is not sacrosanct in itself, but only an expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the particular plaintiff is entitled to protection.” Prosser, Law of Torts, <i>supra</i>, at pp. 332-333.</p>
<p id="65d0d39c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The history of the concept of duty in itself discloses that it is not an old and deep-rooted doctrine but a legal device of the latter half of the nineteenth century designed to curtail the feared propensities of juries toward liberal awards. “It must not be forgotten that ‘duty’ got into our law for the very purpose of combatting what was then feared to be a dangerous delusion (perhaps especially prevalent among juries imbued with popular notions of fairness untempered by paramount judicial policy), viz., that the law might countenance legal redress for all foreseeable harm.” Fleming, An Introduction to the Law of Torts (1967) p. 47.</p>
<p id="65d0d39d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have pointed out that this late 19th century concept of duty, as applied to the instant situation, has led the courts to deny liability. We have noted that this negation of duty emanates from the twin fears that courts will be flooded with an onslaught of (1) fraudulent and (2) indefinable claims. We shall point out why we think neither fear justified.</p>
<p id="65d0faae-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the first instance, the argument proceeds from a doubtful factual assumption. Whatever the possibilities of fraudulent claims of physical injury by disinterested spectators of an accident, a question not in issue in this case, we certainly cannot doubt that a mother who sees her child killed will suffer physical injury from shock. “It seems sufficiently obvious that the shock of a mother at danger or harm to her child may be both a real and a serious injury.” Prosser, Law of Torts, <i>supra</i>, at p. 353.</p>
<p id="65d0faaf-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the second instance, and more fundamentally, the possibility that fraudulent assertions may prompt recovery in isolated cases does not justify a wholesale rejection of the entire class of claims in which that potentiality arises. “Certainly it is a very questionable position for a court to take, that because of the possibility of encouraging fictitious claims compensation should be denied those who have actually suffered serious injury through the negligence of another.” <i>Orlo v. Connecticut Co.</i>, 21 A.2d 402 (Conn. 1941).</p>
<p id="65d0fab0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The possibility that some fraud will escape detection does not justify an abdication of the judicial responsibility to award damages for sound claims: <span title="360" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-360">p. 360</span>if it is “to be conceded that our procedural system for the ascertainment of truth is inadequate to defeat fraudulent claims…the result is a virtual acknowledgment that the courts are unable to render justice in respect to them.” <i>Chiuchiolo v. New England Wholesale Tailors</i>, 150 A. 540 (N.H. 1930).</p>
<p id="65d0fab1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, the application of tort law can never be a matter of mathematical precision. In terms of characterizing conduct as tortious and matching a money award to the injury suffered as well as in fixing the extent of injury, the process cannot be perfect. Yet we cannot let the difficulties of adjudication frustrate the principle that there be a remedy for every substantial wrong.</p>
<p id="65d0fab2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the absence of “overriding policy considerations…foreseeability of risk [is] of…primary importance in establishing the element of duty.” <i>Grafton v. Mollica</i>, 42 Cal.Rptr. 306 (1965). As a classic opinion states: “The risk reasonably to be perceived defines the duty to be obeyed.” <i>Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co.</i>, 162 N.E. 99 (N.Y. 1928). Defendant owes a duty, in the sense of a potential liability for damages, only with respect to those risks or hazards whose likelihood made the conduct unreasonably dangerous, and hence negligent, in the first instance.</p>
<p id="65d0fab3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since the chief element in determining whether defendant owes a duty or an obligation to plaintiff is the foreseeability of the risk, that factor will be of prime concern in every case. Because it is inherently intertwined with foreseeability such duty or obligation must necessarily be adjudicated only upon a case-by-case basis. We cannot now predetermine defendant’s obligation in every situation by a fixed category; no immutable rule can establish the extent of that obligation for every circumstance of the future. We can, however, define guidelines which will aid in the resolution of such an issue as the instant one.</p>
<p id="65d0fab4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We note, first, that we deal here with a case in which plaintiff suffered a shock which resulted in physical injury and we confine our ruling to that case. In determining, in such a case, whether defendant should reasonably foresee the injury to plaintiff, or, in other terminology, whether defendant owes plaintiff a duty of due care, the courts will take into account such factors as the following: (1) Whether plaintiff was located near the scene of the accident as contrasted with one who was a distance away from it. (2) Whether the shock resulted from a direct emotional impact upon plaintiff from the sensory and contemporaneous observance of the accident, as contrasted with learning of the accident from others after its occurrence. (3) Whether plaintiff and the victim were closely related, as contrasted with an absence of any relationship or the presence of only a distant relationship.</p>
<p id="65d0fab5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The evaluation of these factors will indicate the <i>degree</i> of the defendant’s foreseeability: obviously defendant is more likely to foresee that a mother who observes an accident affecting her child will suffer harm than to foretell that a stranger witness will do so. Similarly, the degree of foreseeability of the third person’s injury is far greater in the case of his contemporaneous observance of the accident than that in which he subsequently learns of it. The defendant is more likely to foresee that shock to the nearby, witnessing mother will cause…harm than to anticipate that someone distant from the accident will suffer more than a temporary emotional reaction. All these elements, of course, shade into <span title="361" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-361">p. 361</span>each other; the fixing of obligation, intimately tied into the facts, depends upon each case.</p>
<p id="65d0fab6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the instant case, the presence of all the above factors indicates that plaintiff has alleged a sufficient prima facie case. Surely the negligent driver who causes the death of a young child may reasonably expect that the mother will not be far distant and will upon witnessing the accident suffer emotional trauma. As Dean Prosser has stated: “when a child is endangered, it is not beyond contemplation that its mother will be somewhere in the vicinity, and will suffer serious shock.” Prosser, <i>The Law of Torts</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 353. <i>See also</i> 2 Harper &amp; James, <i>The Law of Torts</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 1039.</p>
<p id="65d0fab7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus we see no good reason why the general rules of tort law, including the concepts of negligence, proximate cause, and foreseeability, long applied to all other types of injury, should not govern the case now before us. Any questions that the cause raises “will be solved most justly by applying general principles of duty and negligence, and…mechanical rules of thumb which are at variance with these principles do more harm than good.” 2 Harper &amp; James, The Law of Torts, <i>supra</i>, p. 1039 (footnote omitted).</p>
<p id="65d0fab8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In short, the history of the cases does not show the development of a logical rule but rather a series of changes and abandonments. Upon the argument in each situation that the courts draw a Maginot Line to withstand an onslaught of false claims, the cases have assumed a variety of postures. At first they insisted that there be no recovery for emotional trauma at all. Retreating from this position, they gave relief for such trauma only if physical impact occurred. They then abandoned the requirement for physical impact but insisted that the victim fear for her own safety, holding that a mother could recover for fear for her children’s safety if she simultaneously entertained a personal fear for herself. They stated that the mother need only be in the “zone of danger.” The final anomaly would be the instant case in which the sister, who observed the accident, would be granted recovery because she was in the “zone of danger,” but the <i>mother</i>, not far distant, would be barred from recovery.</p>
<p id="65d121c9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The successive abandonment of these positions exposes the weakness of artificial abstractions which bar recovery contrary to the general rules. As the commentators have suggested, the problem should be solved by the application of the principles of tort, not by the creation of exceptions to them. Legal history shows that artificial islands of exceptions, created from the fear that the legal process will not work, usually do not withstand the waves of reality and, in time, descend into oblivion.</p>
<p id="65d121ca-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have explained that recovery here will not expose the courts to false claims or a flood of litigation. The test that we have set forth will aid in the proper resolution of future cases. Indeed, the general principles of tort law are acknowledged to work successfully in all other cases of emotional trauma.</p>
<p id="65d121cb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To deny recovery would be to chain this state to an outmoded rule of the 19th century which can claim no current credence. No good reason compels our captivity to an indefensible orthodoxy.</p>
<p id="65d121cc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judgment is reversed.</p>

<p id="65d121cf-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Further Enlargement of Duty.</i></b> Near the end of its seminal opinion, the <i>Dillon</i> court briefly traces the evolution of tort law’s acceptance of claims for primarily emotional loss. As the law transitioned from only allowing emotional distress secondary to some physical harm (or at least impact) to the zone of danger, the court then further widens the circle by permitting a plaintiff to recover for emotional distress despite not being close enough to reasonably fear for her own safety. While the decedent’s sister was close enough, the mother was not. The court believed this situation illustrated the hopeless artificiality of the zone of danger rule, because surely the mother’s grief was just as genuine, and foreseeable, as that of the sibling.</p>

<p id="65d121d2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Physical Manifestation of Emotional Distress.</i></b> In <i>Dillon</i>, as with the plaintiff in <i>Robb</i>, the plaintiff complained of being emotionally upset by witnessing the event and of this causing some physical consequences. Both courts permitted recovery for the emotional injury only because there was a physical manifestation of it. But many other courts, in applying these duty doctrines, do not demand that there be any physical manifestation of the emotional injury. As one court held, “To…require that, before one who is mentally injured may recover, he must at least regurgitate once seems…to be imposing upon the law a requirement that makes little sense.” James v. Lieb, 375 N.W.2d 109, 116 (Neb. 1985) (quoting Fournell v. Usher Pest Control Co., 305 N.W.2d 605, 611 (Neb. 1981)).</p>
<p id="65d121d3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Guidelines Become Prerequisites.</i></b> The court referred to three “factors” or guidelines that were to be a proxy in the analysis for “foreseeability” of the plaintiff’s emotional injury. The plaintiff in <i>Dillon</i> satisfied all three, so the court left undecided whether all three had to be present to pursue a bystander claim for emotional distress. Subsequent decisions from the California Supreme Court ultimately held that all three were requirements rather than just factors. <i>See</i> Thing v. La Chusa, 771 P.2d 814 (Cal. 1989). This is how other jurisdictions following <i>Dillon</i> have treated these three indicia of genuineness—the absence of any of the three negates any duty.</p>
<span title="363" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-363">p. 363</span>
<p id="65d121d4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>How Close Must the Plaintiff Be?</i></b> The first requirement—that the plaintiff be “near the scene” of the accident begs the question “how close is close enough?” Surely one need not be close enough to fear for his own safety or else we would simply regress back to the zone of danger rule. Logically, the first requirement is subsumed by the second—that the plaintiff must have been close enough to have “contemporaneous” sensory observation of the accident. While this second factor seems pretty straightforward, some courts applying <i>Dillon</i> have struggled at times trying to decide whether to admit or deny a claim where the plaintiff did not actually see the accident but came upon it moments later. <i>See</i> Archibald v. Braverman, 275 Cal. App. 2d 253 (Cal. App. 1969) (mother who arrived at scene moments after accident allowed to recover because she had heard it); <i>cf.</i>, Hegel v. McMahon, 960 P.2d 424 (Wash. 1998) (permitting recovery to plaintiff father who arrived at scene ten minutes after his son was killed on his motorcycle and was able to witness son injured but still alive). In <i>McMahon</i>, the Supreme Court of Washington stated with regard to its decision to extend the rule and permit recovery: “A bright line rule that limits recovery for emotional distress to those who witnessed the accident is attractive in its simplicity. However, it draws an arbitrary line that served to exclude plaintiffs without meaningful distinction.” <i>Id.</i> at 428. Courts are all over the map on how strictly to apply this requirement. The risk is that by not taking this requirement seriously, you lose the predictability of the <i>Dillon</i> approach and also create potentially greater liability than originally intended. For example, should a loved one watching the death of their relative on television be allowed to recover?</p>
<p id="65d147e5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. <i>How Badly Hurt Must the Family Member Be?</i></b> Courts applying the <i>Dillon</i> test typically require the primary victim to have suffered death or at least serious bodily injury in the accident. This can be viewed as a fourth prerequisite. In other words, a mother watching her son get knocked off his bicycle and scuffing his knees would not be entitled to recover her emotional distress damages under <i>Dillon</i>. How does this requirement comport with the underlying concern that the emotional injury be authentic and foreseeable?</p>

Grotts commenced her action below against Zahner seeking “bystander” emotional distress damages in connection with fatal injuries sustained by her fiance in the accident.

<p id="65d147ed-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A bystander who witnesses an accident may recover for emotional distress in certain limited situations. <i>See State v. Eaton</i>, 101 Nev. 705, 716, 710 P.2d 1370, 1377-78 (1985) (citing <i>Dillon v. Legg</i>, 68 Cal. 2d 728, 441 P.2d 912, 916, 69 Cal. Rptr. 72 (Cal. 1968)). To recover, the witness-plaintiff must prove that he or she (1) was located near the scene; (2) was emotionally injured by the contemporaneous sensory observance of the accident; and (3) was closely related to the victim.</p>
<p id="65d147ee-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>State Department of Transportation v. Hill</i>, 114 Nev. 810, 816, 963 P.2d 480, 483 (1998), a plurality of this court determined that “whether a plaintiff can recover [damages] for NIED [negligent infliction of emotional distress] after witnessing injury to another based on the plaintiff’s relationship to the victim is generally a question of fact.” Acknowledging that obvious cases will exist where the issue of “closeness” can be determined as a matter of law, the plurality concluded that the fact finder in most cases should be left with the task of assessing the nature and quality of the claimant’s relationship to the victim for these purposes.</p>
<p id="65d147ef-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We now conclude, contrary to the plurality holding in Hill, that standing issues concerning “closeness of relationship” between a victim and a bystander should, as a general proposition, be determined based upon family membership, either by blood or marriage. Immediate family members of the victim qualify for standing to bring NIED claims as a matter of law. When the family relationship between the victim and the bystander is beyond the immediate family [i.e., beyond the first degree of consanguinity] the fact finder should assess the nature and quality of the relationship and, therefrom, determine as a factual matter whether the relationship is close enough to confer standing. This latter category represents the “few close cases” where standing will be determined as an issue of fact, either by a jury or the trial court sitting without a jury. We therefore hold that any non-family “relationship” fails, as a matter of law, to qualify for NIED standing.</p>
<p id="65d147f0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, Grotts claims standing to lodge a “bystander” NIED claim because of her affianced relationship to the victim. Because she was not a member of his “family” by blood or marriage, we hold that she does not enjoy the type of “close relationship” required under Eaton.</p>
<p id="65d147f1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the above reasons, we affirm the trial court.</p>

<p id="65d147f3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Just a year ago, in <i>State Department of Transportation v.

The majority’s departure from the framework set forth in <i>Hill</i> prevents that procedure from being tested in our district courts to determine its validity. I believe we are discarding this precedent prematurely.</p>
<p id="65d147f4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rule adopted by the majority requires a relationship by blood or marriage before one can claim to have a close relationship for purposes of pursuing <span title="365" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-365">p. 365</span>damages for negligent infliction of emotional distress. While this rule will be predictable, it will permit some people to pursue this claim who have no close relationship, and yet prohibit others who have a loving, close relationship with someone injured or killed from pursuing these claims merely because they are not related by blood or marriage.</p>
<p id="65d147f5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case at issue provides a good example. Kellie Grotts and John Colwell were very much in love and expected to marry in the near future. They were at the zenith of love and commitment. Numerous plays and novels have been written about the great loss suffered when this type of relationship ends with the death of one party. Yet the majority denies Kellie Grotts’ claim for emotional distress caused as a result of witnessing the death of the love of her life and constant companion simply because their wedding date was a few months off. This same scenario could happen to an older man and woman who, for a variety of reasons, had lived together for years but were not formally married.</p>
<p id="65d147f6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And the unfairness of the rule adopted today does not stop there. Anyone living in a non-traditional relationship will be denied the chance to recover emotional distress damages, while those living together with benefit of marriage will not suffer such prejudice. It is a fact of life that many gay men and lesbian women have partners with whom they have lived for decades and shared a close, loving relationship. These individuals will be denied the right to even claim damages for emotional distress for witnessing injury or death to their partner for no other reason than that they are not legally married, a status they cannot prevent. The closeness of two people should be judged by the quality and intimacy of the relationship, not by whether there is a blood relationship or whether a document has been filed at the courthouse. A segment of our population should not be denied legal redress simply because of their lifestyle.</p>

<p id="65d16f0a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Predictability and Clarity vs. Fairness.</i></b> Of the three <i>Dillon</i> criteria, some courts concede that the most valuable indicator of foreseeable emotional injury is the family relationship. This is not to say that a family relationship necessarily predicts genuine and deep emotional distress when witnessing injury, or that the lack of a family relationship negates any emotional distress. But the thought is that, in general, witnessing the death or serious injury to a family member causes more emotional distress than to someone else. Some courts, such as the one above, require legal or blood relationship. The dissent would prefer that the closeness of the relationship just be an issue for the jury’s consideration. However, the more predictable the result, the more strict the rules must be applied. This sometimes would mean the dismissal of a claim where the emotional distress was quite severe, presumably such as when a fiancé has died as the majority held above.</p>
<span title="366" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-366">p. 366</span>
<p id="65d16f0b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Other Relationships.</i></b> Strictly applied, would a best friend for life be permitted to sue under <i>Dillon</i>? What about a stepmother? A father-in-law? If the dissent in <i>Grotts</i> were to prevail these would all be jury questions—whether the jury is convinced by the relationship that true emotional distress has occurred. If relationship by blood or marriage is required then the latter two instances might possibly qualify due to the legal relationship.</p>
<p id="65d16f0c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Homosexual Relationships</i>.</b> One concern that the dissent in <i>Grotts</i> mentioned involved those living in “non-traditional relationships” who were once denied the opportunity to create a legally recognized relationship such as marriage. In 2015, however, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584 (2015), that homosexuals were constitutionally entitled to have states permit their formal marriage. As a result, homosexual couples are no longer discriminated against by virtue of the <i>Dillon</i> rule’s general requirement for a legally recognized relationship involving blood or marriage.</p>
<p id="65d16f0d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>False Dichotomy</i>?</b> Most jurisdictions today choose between the two most prevalent rules for recognizing negligent infliction of emotional distress—the zone of danger rule or the <i>Dillon</i> rule. Yet each of these rules permits recovery in light of a different type of emotional distress. Zone of danger permits recovery for distress associated with one’s concern for oneself. The <i>Dillon</i> recovery for emotional distress is limited instead to emotional distress associated with concern for a family member. Given this difference, why should a jurisdiction feel compelled to choose between these two rules? A court could permit recovery if the plaintiff could satisfy either test. This has not yet happened, however. Should it? Perceptive counsel should always be prepared to argue for modification or expansion of existing doctrines when the circumstances reveal a hopeless artificiality in them.</p>

<p id="65d1962a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is a suit for the negligent infliction of emotional distress. We hold that there is no general duty in Texas not to negligently inflict emotional distress. A claimant may recover mental anguish damages only in connection with defendant’s breach of some other legal duty. Because Respondent proceeded below only on the theory of negligent infliction of emotional distress, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals in her favor. However, in the interest of justice, we remand for a new trial.</p>
<p id="65d1962b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On August 10, 1985, Petitioner Dan Boyles, Jr., then seventeen, covertly videotaped nineteen-year-old Respondent Susan Leigh Kerr engaging in sexual intercourse with him. Although not dating steadily, they had known each other a few months and had shared several previous sexual encounters. Kerr testified that she had not had sexual intercourse prior to her relationship with Boyles.</p>
<p id="65d1962c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Kerr and Boyles, who were both home in Houston for the summer, had made plans to go out on the night of the incident. Before picking Kerr up, Boyles arranged with a friend, Karl Broesche, to use the Broesche house for sexual intercourse with Kerr. Broesche suggested videotaping the activity, and Boyles agreed. Broesche and two friends, Ray Widner and John Paul Tamborello, hid a camera in a bedroom before Kerr and Boyles arrived. After setting up the camera, the three videotaped themselves making crude comments and jokes about the activity that was to follow. They left with the camera running, and the ensuing activities were recorded. Boyles took possession of the tape shortly after it was made, and subsequently showed it on three occasions, each time at a private residence. Although he showed the tape to only ten friends, gossip about the incident soon spread among many of Kerr and Boyles’ friends in Houston. Soon many students at Kerr’s school, Southwest Texas State University, and Boyles’ school, the University of Texas at Austin, also became aware of the story. Kerr did not learn of the video until December 1985, long after she and Boyles had stopped seeing each other. After she confronted him, Boyles eventually admitted what he had done and surrendered the tape to Kerr. No copies had been made.</p>
<p id="65d1962d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Kerr alleges that she suffered humiliation and severe emotional distress from the videotape and the gossip surrounding it. At social gatherings, friends and even casual acquaintances would approach her and comment about the video, wanting to know “what [she] was going to do” or “why did [she] do it.” The tape stigmatized Kerr with the reputation of “porno queen” among some of her friends, and <span title="368" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-368">p. 368</span>she claimed that the embarrassment and notoriety affected her academic performance. Kerr also claimed that the incident made it difficult for her to relate to men, although she testified to having had subsequent sexually-active relationships. Eventually, she sought psychological counseling.</p>
<p id="65d1962e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Kerr sued Boyles, Broesche, Widner and Tamborello, alleging intentional invasion of privacy, negligent invasion of privacy, and negligent (but not intentional) infliction of emotional distress. Before the case was submitted to the jury, however, Kerr dropped all causes of action except for negligent infliction of emotional distress. The jury returned a verdict for Kerr on that claim, assessing $500,000 in actual damages. The jury also found that all defendants were grossly negligent, awarding an additional $500,000 in punitive damages, $350,000 of which was assessed against Boyles. The trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the jury’s verdict. Only Boyles appealed to the court of appeals. That court affirmed the judgment against him, concluding that Kerr established negligent infliction of emotional distress under the facts of this case.</p>
<p id="65d1962f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Initially, we must determine whether negligent infliction of emotional distress constitutes an independent cause of action in Texas. Kerr claims that we recognized a broad right to recover for negligently inflicted emotional distress in <i>St. Elizabeth Hospital v. Garrard</i>, 730 S.W.2d 649 (Tex. 1987)<i>.</i> Boyles contends that the <i>Garrard</i> holding is limited to the particular facts of that case.</p>
<p id="65d19630-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Garrard</i>, a hospital negligently disposed of the Garrards’ stillborn baby in an unmarked, common grave without the plaintiffs’ knowledge or consent. The Garrards sued for negligent infliction of emotional distress, without alleging that they suffered any physical injury. This Court nonetheless concluded that they had stated a cause of action. We determined that “Texas first recognized the tort of negligent infliction of mental anguish in <i>Hill v. Kimball</i>, 13 S.W. 59 (Tex. 1890).” This tort, we said, had been administered under traditional tort concepts, subject only to a refinement on the element of damages: the mental suffering is not compensable unless it manifests itself physically. <i>Id</i>. After determining that the physical manifestation requirement was arbitrary because it “denies court access to persons with valid claims they could prove if permitted to do so,” <i>id</i>., we proceeded to abolish it.</p>
<p id="65d19631-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court then proceeded, we believe, to create a general duty not to inflict reasonably foreseeable emotional distress. The Court said:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65d19632-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Clearly, freedom from severe emotional distress is an interest which the law should serve to protect…. Having recognized that an interest merits protection, it is the duty of this court to continually monitor the legal doctrines of this state to insure the public is free from unwarranted restrictions on the right to seek redress for wrongs committed against them…. Thus, we hold that proof of physical injury resulting from mental anguish is no longer an element of the common law action for negligent infliction of mental anguish.</p></div>
<p id="65d19633-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">730 S.W.2d at 653-54<i>.</i> Four justices joined in the judgment, but concurred on the grounds that the same result could be reached under the traditional Texas rule <span title="369" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-369">p. 369</span>allowing emotional distress damages arising from the mishandling of a corpse. If the Court’s holding was, as Boyles contends, limited to the mishandling of corpses, the concurring opinion would not need to have been written, as its rationale would have been incorporated in the majority opinion.</p>
<p id="65d19634-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While the holding of <i>Garrard</i> was correct, we conclude that its reasoning was based on an erroneous interpretation of <i>Hill v. Kimball</i>, and is out of step with most American jurisdictions. Therefore, we overrule the language of <i>Garrard</i> to the extent that it recognizes an independent right to recover for negligently inflicted emotional distress. Instead, mental anguish damages should be compensated only in connection with defendant’s breach of some other duty imposed by law. This was the basis for recovery prior to <i>Garrard</i>, which expanded the scope of liability based on a misconstruction of <i>Hill v. Kimball</i>.</p>
<p id="65d19635-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Hill</i>, a pregnant woman suffered a miscarriage when she witnessed the defendant severely beating two men in her yard. The woman sued for her physical injuries under negligence, claiming that the emotional trauma of witnessing the beatings produced the miscarriage and that the defendant should have reasonably anticipated the danger to her. The Court found that the plaintiff had stated a cause of action. The basis, however, was the physical injury she had suffered, together with her allegation of foreseeability. The Court reasoned as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65d19636-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That a physical personal injury may be produced through a strong emotion of the mind there can be no doubt. The fact that it is more difficult to produce such an injury through the operation of the mind than by direct physical means affords no sufficient ground for refusing compensation, in an action at law, when the injury is intentionally or negligently inflicted…. Here, according to the allegations of the petition, the defendant has produced a bodily injury by means of that emotion, and it is for that injury that the recovery is sought.</p></div>
<p id="65d19637-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">13 S.W. at 59<i>.</i></p>
<p id="65d19638-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court considered only whether the plaintiff could recover for her physical injuries, not whether she could otherwise recover for her emotional distress or mental anguish caused by witnessing the beatings. Furthermore, the Court noted that liability would depend on “whether, under the circumstances, and with the lights before him, a reasonably prudent man would have anticipated the danger to her or not.” <i>Id</i>. In other words, the defendant was negligent if he should have known that he was imposing an unreasonable risk of physical injury to the plaintiff, not if he merely should have anticipated that the plaintiff would suffer emotional distress.</p>
<p id="65d19639-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Hill</i>, therefore, did not recognize a cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress. It merely recognized the right to recover for physical injuries under standard negligence principles, notwithstanding that the physical injury is produced indirectly through emotional trauma. <i>Garrard</i> thus did not merely modify <i>Hill</i>, but created an entirely new cause of action. <i>Garrard</i>, however, ill deserves the lofty pedestal to which the dissent has belatedly elevated it. Even today, the justices of this Court cannot agree on the extent of <i>Garrard</i>’s reach <span title="370" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-370">p. 370</span>and we have never embraced its broad holding. Thus, in <i>Freeman v. City of Pasadena</i>, 744 S.W.2d 923 (Tex. 1988), we limited the bystander cause of action to those persons meeting the criteria of <i>Dillon v. Legg</i>, 68 Cal. 2d 728, 441 P.2d 912, 920, 69 Cal. Rptr. 72 (Cal. 1968), without even citing <i>Garrard</i> as a potential basis for broader liability.</p>
<p id="65d1bd4a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professor Crump, one of Boyles’ appellate counsel, has argued that “it is important…not to lose sight of the contractual relationship between hospital and patient as the source of the underlying duty [in <i>Garrard</i>].” David Crump, <i>Evaluating Independent Torts Based upon “Intentional” or “Negligent” Infliction of Emotional Distress: How Can We Keep the Baby from Dissolving in the Bath Water?</i>, 34 Ariz. L. Rev. 439, 458 (1992).</p>
<p id="65d1bd4b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Considering our opinions and those of other Texas courts, as well as the law in most American jurisdictions, <i>Garrard</i> could fairly be characterized as an anomaly rather than a landmark. We believe the jurisprudence of our state is better served by overruling <i>Garrard</i>’s broad language outright….</p>
<p id="65d1e45c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By overruling the language of <i>Garrard</i>, we hold only that there is no general duty not to negligently inflict emotional distress. Our decision does not affect a claimant’s right to recover mental anguish damages caused by defendant’s breach of some other legal duty. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Fisher v. Coastal Transp. Co.</i>, 230 S.W.2d 522 (Tex. 1950) (negligent infliction of direct physical injury); <i>Moore v. Lillebo</i>, 722 S.W.2d 683 (Tex. 1986) (wrongful death); <i>Fisher v. Carrousel Motor Hotel, Inc</i>., 424 S.W.2d 627 (Tex. 1967) (battery); <i>Stuart v. Western Union Tel. Co.</i>, 66 Tex. 580, 18 S.W. 351 (1885) (failure of telegraph company to timely deliver death message); <i>Billings v. Atkinson</i>, 489 S.W.2d 858 (Tex. 1973) (invasion of privacy); <i>Leyendecker &amp; Assocs., Inc. v. Wechter</i>, 683 S.W.2d 369 (Tex. 1984) (defamation); <i>Pat H. Foley &amp; Co. v. Wyatt</i>, 442 S.W.2d 904 (Tex. Civ. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1969, writ ref’d n.r.e.) (negligent handling of corpse).</p>
<p id="65d1e45d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Also, our holding does not affect the right of bystanders to recover emotional distress damages suffered as a result of witnessing a serious or fatal accident. Texas has adopted the bystander rules originally promulgated by the California Supreme Court in <i>Dillon v. Legg</i>, 441 P.2d 912, 920 (Cal. 1968).</p>
<p id="65d1e45e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The policy concerns that require limiting the emotional distress cause of action in the direct victim case generally do not apply in the bystander case. Before a bystander may recover, he or she must establish that the defendant has negligently inflicted serious or fatal injuries on the primary victim.</p>
<p id="65d1e45f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We emphasize that we are not <i>broadening</i> a claimant’s right to recover mental anguish damages caused by breach of a particular duty; we leave such right unaffected.</p>
<p id="65d1e460-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We also are not imposing a requirement that emotional distress manifest itself physically to be compensable. As explained in <i>Garrard</i>, the sole purpose of the physical manifestation rule is to ensure the genuineness of claims for emotional distress. <i>Garrard</i> criticized this requirement as both under- and overinclusive, <i>id</i>., and we agree. <i>See</i> Julie A. Davies, <i>Direct Actions for Emotional Harm: Is Compromise Possible?</i>, 67 Wash. L. Rev. 1, 24-25 (1992) (the physical <span title="371" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-371">p. 371</span>manifestation rule “has been criticized on the ground that it has no obvious relation to emotional harm”). Where emotional distress is a recognized element of damages for breach of a legal duty, the claimant may recover without demonstrating a physical manifestation of the emotional distress.</p>
<p id="65d1e461-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most other jurisdictions do not recognize a general duty not to negligently inflict emotional distress. A few jurisdictions recognize a general right to recover for negligently inflicted emotional distress, but these jurisdictions are squarely in the minority.</p>
<p id="65d20b72-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals in favor of Kerr on the ground of negligent infliction of emotional distress.</p>
<p id="65d20b73-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In rejecting negligent infliction of emotional distress as an independent cause of action, we stated in the original opinion that “tort law cannot and should not attempt to provide redress for every instance of rude, insensitive or distasteful behavior, even though it may result in hurt feelings, embarrassment, or even humiliation.” We made clear, however, that we did not consider Boyles’ conduct to fall into that category, stating in part as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65d20b74-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The tort system can and does provide a remedy against those who engage in such conduct. But an independent cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress would encompass conduct far less outrageous than that involved here, and such a broad tort is not necessary to allow compensation in a <i>truly egregious case</i> such as this. (Emphasis supplied).</p></div>
<p id="65d20b75-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">We denied recovery not because Boyles breached no duty toward Kerr, but because the only theory which she chose to assert—negligent infliction of emotional distress—was overly broad and would encompass other cases involving merely rude or insensitive behavior. We reaffirm that conclusion today. [The court stated that Kerr might be able to recover instead on a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.]</p>
<p id="65d20b76-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Kerr cannot recover based on the cause of action under which she proceeded. It may well be, however, that she failed to assert and preserve alternative causes of action because of her reliance on our holding in <i>Garrard</i>. We have broad discretion to remand for a new trial in the interest of justice where it appears that a party may have proceeded under the wrong legal theory. Remand is particularly appropriate where the losing party may have presented his or her case in reliance on controlling precedent that was subsequently overruled. We therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand this cause to the trial court for a new trial.</p>

<p id="65d20b79-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Rejection of General Duty.</i></b> The court in <i>Kerr</i> repudiated the only prior holding in that state to suggest a general duty of care to prevent emotional <span title="372" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-372">p. 372</span>distress exists. Rather, the court held that only where the defendant has breached some other independent duty might a recovery for emotional distress be recognized. Where a defendant negligently causes physical harm this is rather obvious. With regard to the prior decision involving the careless disposal of a family member’s body, the court clarifies that we should be mindful of a contractual obligation’s breach as being the cornerstone of the emotional distress recovery. Further, the court states that it recognizes bystander recovery under <i>Dillon</i>’s requirements. How would an emotional distress recovery under <i>Dillon</i> be consistent with this idea of there being a breach of an independent duty?</p>
<p id="65d2328a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Rejection Consistent with Prior Decision.</i></b> In <i>Temple-Inland</i>, seen earlier in Chapter 5 on Causation, the court rejected the effort by the plaintiff to recover for his fear of contracting cancer in the future. One reason for the court’s decision was its rejection of a general duty not to negligently inflict emotional distress in <i>Kerr</i>. Do you see the connection between the two holdings?</p>
<p id="65d2328b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>The Rest of the Story.</i></b> After the trial in <i>Kerr</i>, defense counsel was so overjoyed with what it viewed as a small jury verdict for the plaintiff that it held a party to celebrate. Unfortunately, at the party, the law firm’s staff showed the video—despite a trial court order prohibiting such action. A temporary secretary was present and informed opposing counsel and the court. As a result, the law firm settled with Ms. Kerr for the additional sum of $600,000 for a release from any liability of the firm for displaying the video. Would Ms. Kerr have had a claim against the firm for negligent infliction of emotional distress? If not, what claim, if any, would she have had? Perhaps a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, as discussed in Chapter 2?</p>
<p id="65d2328c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>NIED vs. IIED.</i></b> The reluctance by courts to recognize a general duty to avoid carelessly causing emotional distress to others makes sense when you consider the broader torts landscape. In Chapter 2, we delved into the topic of intentional infliction of emotional distress. You may recall that we saw the courts, while recognizing such a new claim, eager to create fairly high thresholds to recovery to avoid permitting too many claims for trivial matters. These barriers to recovery included: (1) the need for a defendant’s “fault” to rise beyond negligence to either recklessness or intentional infliction of emotional distress; (2) outrageous conduct; and (3) conduct resulting in “severe” emotional distress—something beyond transient or trivial distress. It would make no sense to erect such barriers to recovery for the tort of IIED and then recognize a general duty to avoid carelessly causing emotional distress. Viewed this way, the court’s decision in <i>Kerr</i> is very predictable.</p>

In fact, courts are similarly reluctant to impose a duty of care on actors to avoid causing economic loss to others. As you read the following case, compare the nature of economic loss with emotional distress and the courts’ reaction to imposing a duty of care regarding the avoidance of such economic damage.</p>

<p id="65d23296-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The novel issues raised by these appeals—arising from construction-related disasters in midtown Manhattan—concern a landholder’s duty in negligence where plaintiffs’ sole injury is lost income….</p>
<p id="65d23297-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two of the three appeals involve the same event. On December 7, 1997, a section of the south wall of 540 Madison Avenue, a 39-story office tower, partially collapsed and bricks, mortar and other material fell onto Madison Avenue at 55th Street, a prime commercial location crammed with stores and skyscrapers. The collapse occurred after a construction project, which included putting 94 holes for windows into the building’s south wall, aggravated existing structural defects. New York City officials directed the closure of 15 heavily trafficked blocks on Madison Avenue—from 42nd to 57th Street—as well as adjacent side streets between Fifth and Park Avenues. The closure lasted for approximately two weeks, but some businesses nearest to 540 Madison remained closed for a longer period.</p>
<p id="65d23298-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>532 Madison Ave. Gourmet Foods v. Finlandia Ctr.</i>, plaintiff operates a 24-hour delicatessen one-half block south of 540 Madison, and was closed for five weeks. The two named plaintiffs in the companion case, <i>5th Ave. Chocolatiere v. 540 Acquisition Co.</i>, are retailers at 510 Madison Avenue, two blocks from the building, suing on behalf of themselves and a putative class of “all other business entities, in whatever form, including but not limited to corporations, partnerships and sole proprietorships, located in the Borough of Manhattan and bounded geographically on the west by Fifth Avenue, on the east by Park Avenue, on the north by 57th Street and on the South by 42nd Street.” Plaintiffs allege that shoppers and others were unable to gain access to their stores during the time Madison Avenue was closed to traffic.

<p id="65d259ab-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On defendants’ motions in both cases, Supreme Court dismissed plaintiffs’ negligence claims on the ground that they could not establish that defendants owed a duty of care for purely economic loss in the absence of personal injury or property damage….</p>
<p id="65d259ac-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Goldberg Weprin &amp; Ustin v. Tishman Constr.</i> involves the July 21, 1998 collapse of a 48-story construction elevator tower on West 43rd Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues—the heart of bustling Times Square. Immediately after the accident, the City prohibited all traffic in a wide area of midtown Manhattan and also evacuated nearby buildings for varying time periods. Three actions were consolidated—one by a law firm, a second by a public relations firm and a third by a clothing manufacturer, all situated within the affected area. Plaintiff law firm sought damages for economic loss on behalf of itself and a proposed class “of all persons in the vicinity of Broadway and 42nd Street, New York, New York, whose businesses were affected and/or caused to be closed” as well as a subclass of area residents who were evacuated from their homes.</p>
<p id="65d259ad-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Noting the enormity of the liability sought, including recovery by putative plaintiffs as diverse as hot dog vendors, taxi drivers and Broadway productions, Supreme Court concluded that the failure to allege personal injury or property damage barred recovery in negligence.</p>
<p id="65d259ae-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Appellate Division affirmed dismissal of the <i>Goldberg Weprin</i> complaint, concluding that, absent property damage, the connection between defendants’ activities and the economic losses of the purported class of plaintiffs was “too tenuous and remote to permit recovery on any tort theory.” The court, however, reinstated the negligence and public nuisance claims of plaintiffs <i>532 Madison</i> and <i>5th Ave. Chocolatiere</i>, holding that defendants’ duty to keep their premises in reasonably safe condition extended to “those businesses in such close proximity that their negligent acts could be reasonably foreseen to cause injury” (which included the named merchant plaintiffs) and that, as such, they established a special injury distinct from the general inconvenience to the community at large. Two Justices dissented, urging application of the “economic loss” rule, which <span title="375" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-375">p. 375</span>bars recovery in negligence for economic damage absent personal injury or property damage.</p>
<p id="65d259af-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We now reverse in <i>532 Madison</i> and <i>5th Ave. Chocolatiere</i> and affirm in <i>Goldberg Weprin &amp; Ustin.</i></p>
<p id="65d259b0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs contend that defendants owe them a duty to keep their premises in reasonably safe condition, and that this duty extends to protection against economic loss even in the absence of personal injury or property damage. Defendants counter that the absence of any personal injury or property damage precludes plaintiffs’ claims for economic injury.</p>
<p id="65d259b1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The existence and scope of a tortfeasor’s duty is, of course, a legal question for the courts, which “fix the duty point by balancing factors, including the reasonable expectations of parties and society generally, the proliferation of claims, the likelihood of unlimited or insurer-like liability, disproportionate risk and reparation allocation, and public policies affecting the expansion or limitation of new channels of liability” (<i>Hamilton v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp</i>., 96 N.Y.2d 222, 232 [quoting <i>Palka v. Servicemaster Mgt. Servs. Corp.</i>, 83 N.Y.2d 579, 586]). At its foundation, the common law of torts is a means of apportioning risks and allocating the burden of loss. In drawing lines defining actionable duty, courts must therefore always be mindful of the consequential, and precedential, effects of their decisions.</p>
<p id="65d259b2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As we have many times noted, foreseeability of harm does not define duty. Absent a duty running directly to the injured person there can be no liability in damages, however careless the conduct or foreseeable the harm. This restriction is necessary to avoid exposing defendants to unlimited liability to an indeterminate class of persons conceivably injured by any negligence in a defendant’s act.</p>
<p id="65d259b3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A duty may arise from a special relationship that requires the defendant to protect against the risk of harm to plaintiff. Landowners, for example, have a duty to protect tenants, patrons and invitees from foreseeable harm caused by the criminal conduct of others while they are on the premises, because the special relationship puts them in the best position to protect against the risk. That duty, however, does not extend to members of the general public. Liability is in this way circumscribed, because the special relationship defines the class of potential plaintiffs to whom the duty is owed.</p>
<p id="65d259b4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Strauss v. Belle Realty Co.</i> (65 N.Y.2d 399) we considered whether a utility owed a duty to a plaintiff injured in a fall on a darkened staircase during a citywide blackout. While the injuries were logically foreseeable, there was no contractual relationship between the plaintiff and the utility for lighting in the building’s common areas. As a matter of policy, we restricted liability for damages in negligence to direct customers of the utility in order to avoid crushing exposure to the suits of millions of electricity consumers in New York City and Westchester.</p>
<p id="65d259b5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even closer to the mark is <i>Milliken &amp; Co. v. Consolidated Edison Co.</i> (84 N.Y.2d 469), in which an underground water main burst near 38th Street and 7th Avenue in Manhattan. The waters flooded a subbasement where Consolidated Edison <span title="376" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-376">p. 376</span>maintained an electricity supply substation, and then a fire broke out, causing extensive damage that disrupted the flow of electricity to the Manhattan Garment Center and interrupting the biannual Buyers Week. Approximately 200 Garment Center businesses brought more than 50 lawsuits against Con Edison, including plaintiffs who had no contractual relationship with the utility and who sought damages solely for economic loss. Relying on <i>Strauss</i>, we again held that only those persons contracting with the utility could state a cause of action. We circumscribed the ambit of duty to avoid limitless exposure to the potential suits of every tenant in the skyscrapers embodying the urban skyline.</p>
<p id="65d259b6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A landowner who engages in activities that may cause injury to persons on adjoining premises surely owes those persons a duty to take reasonable precautions to avoid injuring them. We have never held, however, that a landowner owes a duty to protect an entire urban neighborhood against purely economic losses. A comparison of <i>Beck v. FMC Corp.</i> (53 A.D.2d 118, 121, aff’d 42 N.Y.2d 1027) and <i>Dunlop Tire &amp; Rubber Corp. v. FMC Corp</i>. (53 A.D.2d 150, 154-155) is instructive. Those cases arose out of the same incident: an explosion at defendant FMC’s chemical manufacturing plant caused physical vibrations, and rained stones and debris onto plaintiff Dunlop Tire’s nearby factory. The blast also caused a loss of electrical power—by destroying towers and distribution lines owned by a utility—to both Dunlop Tire and a Chevrolet plant located one and one-half miles away. Both establishments suffered temporary closure after the accident. Plaintiffs in <i>Beck</i> were employees of the Chevrolet plant who sought damages for lost wages caused by the plant closure. Plaintiff Dunlop Tire sought recovery for property damage emanating from the blast and the loss of energy, and lost profits sustained during the shutdown.</p>
<p id="65d259b7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Dunlop Tire</i>, the Appellate Division observed that, although part of the damage occurred from the loss of electricity and part from direct physical contact, defendant’s duty to plaintiffs was undiminished. The court permitted plaintiffs to seek damages for economic loss, subject to the general rule requiring proof of the extent of the damage and the causal relationship between the negligence and the damage. The <i>Beck</i> plaintiffs, by contrast, could not state a cause of action, because, to extend a duty to defendant FMC would, “like the rippling of the waters, [go] far beyond the zone of danger of the explosion,” to everyone who suffered purely economic loss (<i>Beck v. FMC Corp.</i>, 53 A.D.2d, at 121, <i>supra</i>).</p>
<p id="65d280c8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Policy-driven line-drawing is to an extent arbitrary because, wherever the line is drawn, invariably it cuts off liability to persons who foreseeably might be plaintiffs. The <i>Goldberg Weprin</i> class, for example, would include all persons in the vicinity of Times Square whose businesses had to be closed and a subclass of area residents evacuated from their homes; the <i>5th Ave. Chocolatiere</i> class would include all business entities between 42nd and 57th Streets and Fifth and Park Avenues. While the Appellate Division attempted to draw a careful boundary at storefront merchant-neighbors who suffered lost income, that line excludes others similarly affected by the closures—such as the law firm, public relations firm, clothing manufacturer and other displaced plaintiffs in <i>Goldberg Weprin</i>, the thousands of professional, commercial and residential tenants situated in <span title="377" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-377">p. 377</span>the towers surrounding the named plaintiffs, and suppliers and service providers unable to reach the densely populated New York City blocks at issue in each case.</p>
<p id="65d280c9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As is readily apparent, an indeterminate group in the affected areas thus may have provable financial losses directly traceable to the two construction-related collapses, with no satisfactory way geographically to distinguish among those who have suffered purely economic losses. In such circumstances, limiting the scope of defendants’ duty to those who have, as a result of these events, suffered personal injury or property damage—as historically courts have done—affords a principled basis for reasonably apportioning liability.</p>
<p id="65d280ca-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We therefore conclude that plaintiffs’ negligence claims based on economic loss alone fall beyond the scope of the duty owed them by defendants and should be dismissed.</p>

<p id="65d280cd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Mere Economic Loss and Emotional Distress</i>.</b> Like emotional distress, courts have generally held that there is no duty to avoid causing economic loss alone (“mere economic loss”). In both instances, the absence of physical harm to the plaintiff or the plaintiff’s tangible property raises concern as to both the authenticity of the loss and the potential for unlimited liability far in excess of any wrongdoing. The requirement for physical harm as a general prerequisite to recovery of either type of damage certainly provides a bright line for when a court will impose a duty of care.</p>
<p id="65d280ce-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Imposing a Duty Only with Hindsight.</i></b> The mere economic loss rule says to the tortfeasor, in effect, that a duty of care will only arise when the negligence causes some physical harm. Until the tort is carried out, one cannot gauge whether the actor was under any duty of care. It is only with hindsight, when we can look at the ripples of harm, that we can determine whether any duty of care was owed.</p>
<p id="65d280cf-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Problems.</i></b> Consider the application of the mere economic loss rule to the following circumstances:</p>

The crew working on the rig fails to maintain the rig properly and an explosion ensues, followed by a massive oil spill. EP fails to respond appropriately to the spill and the environmental pollution extends to beaches, wetlands, and estuaries all along the Gulf Coast. Not only are property owners impacted by the pollution, but also many other business owners in the area suffer business losses. For example, numerous seafood restaurants have trouble obtaining locally caught shrimp, lose customers, and go out of business. Local bait shops, boat charters, and even wedding planners lose money from the oil spill. They sue for these losses.</p></li></ol>
<p id="65d2a7e3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Special Relationships Altering Mere Economic Loss Rule</i>.</b> In certain situations courts do not anticipate there being any physical harm caused by a defendant’s negligence but still permit recovery. For example, in most legal or accounting malpractice cases the entirety of the harm is economic. Courts do not have difficulty recognizing a duty of care owed by the professional toward their client, notwithstanding the mere economic harm rule. The special relationship trumps the concerns of the mere economic harm rule. Sometimes, even outside the professional-client relationship, courts will permit a claim for economic losses to be made against such a professional (e.g. an accountant who gives a poor financial report relied upon by a bank to extend a loan). In this scenario, courts have fashioned special rules related to whether one without privity of contract can still maintain a cause of action. In this non-physical scenario, however, courts rarely concern themselves with the mere economic harm rule.</p>
<p id="65d2a7e4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. <i>Fishermen.</i></b> There are a number of reported cases involving fishermen who have lost profits associated with the defendant having caused physical harm to someone else (e.g., the owner of the boats utilized by the fishermen). Courts tend to treat the fishermen as a special class of claimants and avoid application of the mere economic harm rule to their claims, as a limited exception to this rule. This exception seems to reflect traditional sympathy for such plaintiffs rather than any conceptual distinction.</p>

<p id="65d2ceff-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Plaintiff Ruth Johnson sued defendant University Hospitals of Cleveland and three doctors for their negligence in performing a tubal ligation for sterilization purposes. Due to their negligence, the plaintiff became pregnant and gave birth to a healthy baby girl. Plaintiff’s suit for negligence seeks damages for pain and suffering from the pregnancy and birth, the medical bills related to her pregnancy and giving birth, and the lifetime child-rearing expenses anticipated for her daughter. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff of $12,500, which was the cost associated with her pain and suffering and the medical expenses. The court denied any recovery for the costs of raising her daughter. The court of appeals held that Ohio recognizes a claim for wrongful pregnancy but limited the costs to “damages arising from the pregnancy itself…delivery fees, prenatal care, loss of spousal consortium and services during pregnancy, pain and suffering during pregnancy and child birth, etc.” The court upheld the trial court’s refusal to permit damages for the expenses of raising a healthy child because such award would ignore the benefit the parents receive from the joys of raising a child—the court holding that, as a matter of law, these benefits outweigh the financial burdens of parenting. Further the court held that it would be a windfall to the parents to make the defendant pay these costs. Finally, the court found that the costs of raising the daughter were too speculative to permit recovery. Plaintiff appeals from this decision.]</p>

<p id="65d2cf01-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issue raised in this case is whether the parent of a healthy, normal child, born subsequent to a negligently performed sterilization operation, may recover, as an element of damages, the expenses of raising the child.</p>
<p id="65d2cf02-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Numerous cases in other jurisdictions have been reported concerning the type of action before us. These cases have been variously classified as “wrongful pregnancy,” “wrongful birth,” or “wrongful life.” However, a consensus appears to be emerging that several distinct causes of action are described in these categories. <i>Smith v. Gore</i> (Tenn. 1987), 728 S.W.2d 738, 741.</p>
<p id="65d2cf03-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An action for “wrongful pregnancy” refers to a suit filed by a parent for proximate damages arising from the birth of a child subsequent to a doctor’s failure to properly perform a sterilization procedure. The case before us now is a “wrongful pregnancy” action.</p>
<span title="380" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-380">p. 380</span>
<p id="65d2cf04-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Wrongful birth,” on the other hand, refers to a cause of action whereby parents, on their own behalf, seek to recover damages for the birth of an impaired child when the impairment was caused by the defendant’s failure to diagnose or discover a genetic defect in the parents or the infant through prenatal testing or counseling in time for the parent to obtain a eugenic abortion or to prevent pregnancy altogether.</p>
<p id="65d2cf05-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[There is also a “wrongful life” action that a child might attempt to bring, complaining that the doctor’s negligence caused his birth and that he would have been better off not to have been born.]</p>
<p id="65d2cf06-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This court in <i>Bowman</i>, a five-to-two <i>per curiam</i> decision, clearly decided that Ohio recognizes a “wrongful pregnancy” action. Such a cause is “not barred by notions of public policy. The choice not to procreate, as part of one’s right to privacy, has become (subject to certain limitations) a Constitutional guarantee.” <i>Bowman</i> at 46, 2 O.O.3d at 135, 356 N.E.2d at 499.</p>
<p id="65d2cf07-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Bowman</i> did not directly address the measure of damages in a “wrongful pregnancy” action.</p>
<p id="65d2cf08-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, whether child-rearing expenses are recoverable in a “wrongful pregnancy” action in Ohio is a question of first impression. Numerous jurisdictions have already addressed this issue and four theories of recovery of damages in a “wrongful pregnancy” action have developed. We will review these four theories.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="65d2cf09-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b">NO RECOVERY</p></div>
<p id="65d2cf0a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When cases of this kind were first brought in the United States, courts were hesitant to recognize any cause of action at all. An early case, <i>Christensen v. Thornby</i> (1934), 255 N.W. 620, involved a failed vasectomy. The Minnesota Supreme Court denied any recovery in that case. Subsequently, in <i>Shaheen v. Knight</i> (1957), 11 Pa. D. &amp; C.2d 41, a Pennsylvania common pleas court held that to permit damages for the birth of a healthy child was foreign to the popular sentiment regarding children and the family. Both of these jurisdictions now recognize an action for “wrongful pregnancy.”</p>
<p id="65d2cf0b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recently, at least one other court has taken the position that the birth of a normal child is “an event which, of itself, is not a legally compensable injurious consequence even if the birth is partially attributable to the negligent conduct of someone purporting to be able to prevent the eventuality of childbirth.” <i>Szekeres v. Robinson</i> (Nev. 1986), 715 P.2d 1076, 1078. Thus, Nevada is currently the only jurisdiction to adhere to this absolute position of no tort recovery in a “wrongful pregnancy” action, at least when a normal, healthy child is born.</p>

<p id="65d2f61d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Several jurisdictions recognize that an uninterrupted chain of causation exists between a negligently performed sterilization procedure and the foreseeable consequences of the conception, pregnancy and birth of a normal child. <i>C.S. v. Nielson</i> (Utah 1988), 767 P.2d 504, 510-511.</p>
<span title="381" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-381">p. 381</span>
<p id="65d2f61e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, these courts believe that “it must be recognized that [rearing] costs are a direct financial injury to the parents, no different in immediate effect than the medical expenses resulting from the wrongful conception and birth of the child. Although public sentiment may recognize that to the vast majority of parents the long-term and enduring benefits of parenthood outweigh the economic costs of rearing a healthy child, it would seem myopic to declare today that those benefits exceed the costs as a matter of law.” <i>Sherlock v. Stillwater Clinic</i> (Minn. 1977), 260 N.W.2d 169, 175.</p>
<p id="65d2f61f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Courts adhering to the benefits rule permit] the jury to calculate the economic cost of child rearing by weighing the expense against the worth of the child’s companionship, comfort and aid to the parents [opining that] the calculations of the cost of child rearing are based on well-recognized economic factors regularly made by estate planners and insurance companies and are fully appreciated by the average citizen’s own family experience.</p>
<p id="65d2f620-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, this approach has been criticized as essentially comparing apples to oranges because it requires the jury to compare pecuniary costs with non-pecuniary benefits and then offset the economic costs of child rearing with these intangible benefits.</p>

<p id="65d2f622-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The vast majority of jurisdictions which have decided the issue adheres to this theory of damages which denies all <i>child-rearing expenses</i>. Refusal to permit recovery has been based upon various considerations:</p>
<p id="65d2f623-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">1. A parent cannot be said to have been damaged by the birth of a normal, healthy child because the benefits of having a child outweigh any economic loss which the parents might incur in rearing and educating a healthy child.</p>
<p id="65d2f624-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">2. Child-rearing expenses will be a windfall to the parents, wholly disproportionate to the doctor’s culpability.</p>
<p id="65d2f625-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">3. Another rationale is that the cost of child-rearing would be too speculative to measure with any certainty.</p>
<p id="65d2f626-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“[I]t seems to us that that kind of judgment [recovery for child-rearing costs], if appropriate at all in an American Court of law, might be applied at the end of a life, after it has been lived and when the facts can be identified. But, in our view, any attempt to apply it at birth can only be an exercise in prophecy, an undertaking not within the speciality of our factfinders.” <i>Coleman v. Garrison</i> (Del. 1975), 349 A.2d 8, 12.</p>
<p id="65d2f627-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">4. Recovery should be denied to protect the mental and emotional health of the child, sometimes harshly described as an “emotional bastard.”</p>
<p id="65d2f628-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts are concerned that if they grant child-rearing costs to the parents in a “wrongful pregnancy” case, that one day the child will learn that he or she was not only unwanted by his or her parents, but was reared by funds supplied by another person, and that this will greatly upset the child.</p>
<p id="65d2f629-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">5. Damages for a “wrongful pregnancy” action should not include child-rearing costs since to allow damages would be the equivalent of allowing damages in an action for “wrongful life.”</p>

<p id="65d2f62b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This rule has little, if any, support. However, at least one court considers <i>Custodio v. Bauer</i> (1967), 251 Cal. App. 2d 303, 59 Cal. Rptr. 463, to be a full recovery case. <i>See Smith v. Gore</i>, supra, at 742. A California appellate court in <i>Custodio</i>, applying general tort principles, found that a child is a foreseeable consequence of a failed sterilization procedure and stated that if a “change in the family status can be measured economically it should be as compensable as the [other] losses.” <i>Custodio</i>, supra, at 323-324, 59 Cal. Rptr. at 476.</p>
<p id="65d2f62c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant argues that she is entitled to a full recovery because all the expenses for child support are foreseeable and proximately caused by the negligent sterilization.</p>
<p id="65d31d3d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In regard to the extent of damages, a number of courts have discussed the reasonableness of the alternatives to rearing a child, <i>i.e.</i>, an abortion or adoption, as part of the duty to mitigate.</p>
<p id="65d31d3e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellees have contended that if this court adopts the tort benefits rule, parents would have to mitigate their damages for child rearing by adoption or abortion. Appellees further argue that if the parents choose neither to abort nor adopt and instead keep the child, the jury would have to take this lack of mitigation into consideration when calculating child-rearing expenses.</p>
<p id="65d31d3f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We refuse to say as a matter of law that every parent must mitigate damages by abortion or adoption as a “reasonable effort” to avoid child-rearing expenses. In fact, we find either suggestion repugnant. Many people would be opposed to either recourse. Thus, in a “wrongful pregnancy” action, the mother need not mitigate damages by abortion or adoption since a tort victim has no duty to make <i>unreasonable</i> efforts to diminish or avoid prospective damages.</p>
<p id="65d31d40-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We come now to decide which course of action is best for Ohio. In doing so, we comment that this has been one of the most difficult cases we have been called upon to decide. Our occupational duty continuously requires us to balance rights and responsibilities of persons regardless of their color, sex, position or station in life. We accomplish that balancing in this case while recognizing that our decision will be something less than universally accepted.</p>
<p id="65d31d41-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We reject the “no recovery” rule as being one that is clearly in conflict with the traditional concepts of tort law. Certainly, in the case now before us, there was a duty and a breach of that duty which was the proximate cause of damage. What damages should be allowed is the more difficult question.</p>
<p id="65d31d42-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Likewise, we are opposed to following the benefits rule because of the impossibility of a jury placing a price tag on a child’s benefits to her parents. We are not in the business of placing a value on a smile or quantifying the negative impact of a temper tantrum. We are not qualified to judge whether a child might become President or a hopeless derelict. We cannot pretend to know what the future may hold—and neither can or may a jury!</p>
<p id="65d31d43-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Furthermore, we are not persuaded to adopt the full recovery rule because the strict rules of tort should not be applied to an action to which they are not <span title="383" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-383">p. 383</span>suited, such as a wrongful pregnancy case, in which a doctor’s tortious conduct permits to occur the birth of a child rather than the causing of an injury.</p>
<p id="65d31d44-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After reviewing the four theories of recovery, we find the limited damages theory is the most persuasive rule. Allowing a jury to award child-rearing costs would be to invite unduly speculative and ethically questionable assessments of such matters as the emotional effect of a birth on siblings as well as parents, and the emotional as well as the pecuniary costs of raising an unplanned and, perhaps, unwanted child in varying family environments.</p>
<p id="65d31d45-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Additionally, these speculative expenses for child rearing in a “wrongful pregnancy” action were not recognized at common law, just as damages were not recognized in an action for “wrongful death.” We believe that if such expenses are to be recognized, it is the role of the General Assembly to establish guidelines in a “wrongful pregnancy” action as the legislature has done in allowing damages in “wrongful death” actions.</p>
<p id="65d31d46-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, in a “wrongful pregnancy” action, Ohio recognizes the “limited damages” rule which limits the damages to the pregnancy itself and does not include child-rearing expenses. The extent of recoverable damages is limited by Ohio’s public policy that the birth of a normal, healthy child cannot be an injury to her parents.</p>
<p id="65d31d47-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are aware of the possible hardships that might result from today’s decision and we are not blind to the economic realities that accompany the rearing of a child. However, if liability is to be extended in such cases to child-rearing expenses, then the General Assembly is the proper forum in which the competing social philosophies involved in “wrongful pregnancy” actions should be considered in establishing the law.</p>
<p id="65d31d48-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, based on the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>

Plaintiffs alleged Dr. Krusen was negligent in advising them that Mrs. Nelson was not a genetic carrier of muscular dystrophy and was no more likely than any other woman to have a child afflicted by the disease. Plaintiffs contend that had the defendant given them the proper advice, they would have terminated the pregnancy.</p>
<p id="65d34467-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to the summary judgment evidence, the Nelsons already had one child with muscular dystrophy when they learned Mrs. Nelson was pregnant again.

<p id="65d36b7c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The reason for permitting the Nelsons a cause of action, but denying a similar cause of action to their son is simple: the claim of the parents arguably contains all the elements for a prima facie case in negligence; the claim of the child does not.</p>
<p id="65d36b7d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Viewing Dr. Krusen’s alleged conduct from the standpoint of the parents, under the summary judgment evidence and pleadings a viable suit in negligence is presented. The elements of actionable negligence are duty, a breach of that duty, an injury to the person owed the duty, and proximate cause. <i>Pullman Co. v. Caviness</i>, 116 S.W. 410 (1909, writ ref’d). The duty to give accurate medical advice runs from the doctor to the patient. That duty was arguably breached. Since the parents allege that they would have sought an abortion had they known Mrs. Nelson was a genetic carrier of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, proximate cause must be presumed. The injury consists of medical bills that would not have been incurred by the parents, but for the birth of Mark Nelson.</p>
<p id="65d36b7e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The “wrongful life” cause of action must be viewed from a different perspective, that of the child. With the child as a plaintiff, a suit in negligence is difficult to conceptualize. Courts examining “wrongful life” suits have had difficulty with virtually every element of the cause of action—the nature of the duty, if any, owed to an unborn child under these circumstances, the concomitant question of breach, and the issue of proximate cause in a situation where both the child’s life and his or her defective condition are due to the same negligent act.</p>
<p id="65d36b7f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I am most concerned by the element of injury. We cannot compare Mark Nelson’s current condition, life as a victim of muscular dystrophy, with the alternative of a normal, healthy childhood. Were this so, the fact of injury would not be in issue, and the sole question would be the calculation of the extent of damages. Under the summary judgment evidence, the same medical advice that was the proximate cause of his affliction must be assumed to be the cause of his life itself. To determine whether Mark Nelson has suffered an injury in fact, then, his life with physical impairment must be compared to the alternative of nonexistence.</p>
<p id="65d36b80-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This calculation cannot rationally be made, as man knows nothing of nonexistence, and can assign it neither a positive nor a negative value. Unfortunately, the fact of injury is a prima facie element in a cause of action for negligence. <i>Johnson v. Sovereign Camp, W.O.W.</i>, 125 Tex. 329, 83 S.W.2d 605 (1935). It is not fatal to a cause of action in negligence that a plaintiff cannot prove the quantum of injury; but a plaintiff must always establish the <i>existence</i> of injury. This is an impossible burden for a “wrongful life” plaintiff to meet. <span title="386" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-386">p. 386</span>Since the initial burden of proof of each element of a negligence cause of action is upon the plaintiff, and one element is rationally unprovable in a “wrongful life” setting, a negligence suit cannot be maintained. The absence of any injury in fact is also a primary factor in the refusal of New York courts to recognize a “wrongful life” cause of action. <i>See, e.g., Becker v. Schwartz</i>, 46 N.Y.2d 401, 413 N.Y.S.2d 895, 900, 386 N.E.2d 807 (1978); <i>Alquijay v. St. Luke’s-Roosevelt Hospital Center</i>, 99 A.D.2d 704, 472 N.Y.S.2d 2, 3 (1984).</p>
<p id="65d36b81-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no inconsistency between permitting a cause of action for the parents, but not for the child. The difference is the identity of the parties. For the parents, the alternatives to be considered in determining whether there has been any injury in fact are no child, and no medical expenses, or a child with physical impairment resulting in medical expenses the parents are obligated to pay. The fact of injury is apparent. For the child, though, the alternatives are existence in an impaired state, or nonexistence. The fact of injury is not only not apparent, but unknowable.</p>
<p id="65d36b82-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The distinction between the parents’ and child’s cause of action has also been explained in a somewhat different fashion:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65d36b83-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the plaintiff alleges that his own birth was wrongful, in effect he asks the court to judicially determine that he should not have been allowed to live, but when another person such as a parent alleges that the infant should not have been born, the parent does not seek to negate his own present existence. <i>The parent is in reality seeking damages for injuries causally related to the fact of birth, but not for the birth itself</i>. Thus, the parents are not placed in the anomalous position of trying to sue themselves into oblivion, as are the children.</p></div>

<p id="65d39295-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is worth noting that most other jurisdictions make the same distinction as this court makes today, finding no logical inconsistency between permitting a cause of action for the parents, but not for children.

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65d39296-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An action brought by a child against the parents or physician on the theory that because of his illegitimacy or birth defects he would have been better not born has found almost no support in the law.

Even more recently, New Jersey has approved the same result—permitting a child’s recovery of extraordinary medical expenses—albeit on a different rationale. <i>Procanik v. Cillo</i>, 97 N.J. 339, 478 A.2d 755 (1984). It is tempting to join these courts in fashioning some relief for a severely handicapped child, when that child may be burdened with crushing medical expenses for the remainder of his natural life.</p>

<p id="65d3929d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The California Supreme Court distinguished between general and special damages in a “wrongful life” setting, denying the former, yet permitting the latter. Explaining why general damages could not be assessed, the <i>Turpin</i> court observed that “the problem is not…simply the fixing of damages for a conceded injury, but the threshold question of determining whether the plaintiff has in fact suffered an injury by being born with an ailment as opposed to not being born at all.” 643 P.2d at 963. The court also noted that “it is simply impossible to determine in any rational or reasoned fashion whether the plaintiff has in fact suffered an injury in being born impaired rather than not being born.” <i>Id.</i></p>
<p id="65d3929e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, the California Supreme Court, in denying general damages, seems to have explicitly conceded that a prima facie element of the tort was not established. In deciding to award special damages, however, the <i>Turpin</i> court ignored the reasoning that prevented an award of general damages. The problem of establishing the fact of injury was simply passed over, and all discussion focused on the nonspeculative nature of a recovery for medical expenses.</p>
<p id="65d3929f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To reiterate, the pleadings and briefs of plaintiffs in this case are based in negligence. While this court is not adverse to reexamining and modifying traditional negligence concepts to meet changing social needs, <i>see Otis Eng’g Corp. v. Clark</i>, 668 S.W.2d 307 (Tex. 1983), it is properly unwilling to take the step required by a “wrongful life” plaintiff: complete <i>waiver</i> of the requirement of injury in a negligence cause of action. Once such a step is taken, it is difficult to envision any principled basis for refusing to extend the reasoning to other elements and other situations.</p>
<p id="65d3b9b0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This court neither addresses nor decides the question of whether some day, under some different theory, a plaintiff might prevail under similar facts. “New and nameless torts are being recognized constantly, and the progress of the common law is marked by many cases of first impression, in which the court <span title="388" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-388">p. 388</span>has struck out boldly to create a new cause of action, where none has been recognized before.” W. Prosser and W. Keeton, <i>The Law of Torts §1</i> (5th ed. 1984). The claim of Mark Nelson, however, simply fails to state a cause of action in negligence and must be denied.</p>

How would the court analyze the existence of their wrongful birth cause of action? Would the birth of their healthy son be viewed as a viable wrongful birth claim?

We just finished reading two categories of cases, one rejecting a general duty to <span title="389" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-389">p. 389</span>avoid causing emotional distress (<i>Kerr</i>) and the other rejecting a negligence claim for economic losses (<i>Finlandia</i>). Is it odd that a plaintiff can pursue a type of negligence claim that consists of both of these questionable types of damages? Consider the relationship between the plaintiffs and defendant in a wrongful birth claim that helps to avoid limitless liability to the public.</p>

<p id="65d3e0cb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Negligence claims that are not associated with physical harm but instead with emotional or economic injuries are suspect in tort law. This is because the harm might be easily feigned and because imposing a duty to avoid such harms generally could expose defendants to far-flung, unlimited liability far beyond what courts would deem acceptable. Rather than stifle activity, courts craft small exceptions. With respect to emotional distress, courts will recognize bystander claims while rejecting any general duty to avoid causing emotional problems. For economic loss, courts essentially cling to something analogous to the impact rule—that absent physical harm to one’s property or person you cannot recover purely economic losses. With respect to newborn children, courts refuse to recognize a wrongful life claim by a disabled child whose life might have been avoided by careful prenatal diagnosis and the performance of an abortion. The harm is too conjectural and problematic—courts refuse to acknowledge that one might be better off unborn than born with problems. The claim by parents is not problematic for the courts as we can identify and measure their harm.</p>

In this section, we will see courts negate any duty of care in instances where the doctrine of primary assumption of risk applies. You may have already heard the phrase “assumption of the risk.” If so, be warned that tort law has three very distinct varieties of assumption of risk. Two of these types of assumption of risk—<i>secondary implied</i> and <i>express</i>—are dealt with in Chapter 7 under the topic of Affirmative Defenses. By contrast, <i>primary assumption of the risk</i> operates to impair the plaintiff’s ability to show negligence against the <span title="390" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-390">p. 390</span>defendant and is not, technically speaking, an affirmative defense.

<p id="65d407ec-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of the supposed attractions is known as “The Flopper.” It is a moving belt, running upward on an inclined plane, on which passengers sit or stand. Many of them are unable to keep their feet because of the movement of the belt, and are thrown backward or aside. The belt runs in a groove, with padded walls on either side to a height of four feet, and with padded flooring beyond the walls at the same angle as the belt. An electric motor supplies the needed power.</p>
<p id="65d407ed-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff, a vigorous young man, visited the park with friends. One of them, a young woman, now his wife, stepped upon the moving belt. Plaintiff followed and stepped behind her. As he did so, he felt what he describes as a sudden jerk, and was thrown to the floor. His wife in front and also friends behind him were thrown at the same time. Something more was here, as every one understood, than the slowly moving escalator that is common in shops and public places. A fall was foreseen as one of the risks of the adventure. There would have been no point to the whole thing, no adventure about it, if the risk had <span title="391" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-391">p. 391</span>not been there. The very name above the gate, the Flopper, was warning to the timid. If the name was not enough, there was warning more distinct in the experience of others. We are told by the plaintiff’s wife that the members of her party stood looking at the sport before joining in it themselves. Some aboard the belt were able, as she viewed them, to sit down with decorum or even to stand and keep their footing; others jumped or fell. The tumbling bodies and the screams and laughter supplied the merriment and fun. “I took a chance,” she said when asked whether she thought that a fall might be expected.</p>
<p id="65d407ee-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff took the chance with her, but, less lucky than his companions, suffered a fracture of a knee cap. He states in his complaint that the belt was dangerous to life and limb in that it stopped and started violently and suddenly and was not properly equipped to prevent injuries to persons who were using it without knowledge of its dangers, and in a bill of particulars he adds that it was operated at a fast and dangerous rate of speed and was not supplied with a proper railing, guard or other device to prevent a fall therefrom. No other negligence is charged.</p>
<p id="65d407ef-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We see no adequate basis for a finding that the belt was out of order. It was already in motion when the plaintiff put his foot on it. He cannot help himself to a verdict in such circumstances by the addition of the facile comment that it threw him with a jerk. One who steps upon a moving belt and finds his heels above his head is in no position to discriminate with nicety between the successive stages of the shock, between the jerk which is a cause and the jerk, accompanying the fall, as an instantaneous effect. There is evidence for the defendant that power was transmitted smoothly, and could not be transmitted otherwise. If the movement was spasmodic, it was an unexplained and, it seems, an inexplicable departure from the normal workings of the mechanism. An aberration so extraordinary, if it is to lay the basis for a verdict, should rest on something firmer than a mere descriptive epithet, a summary of the sensations of a tense and crowded moment. But the jerk, if it were established, would add little to the case. Whether the movement of the belt was uniform or irregular, the risk at greatest was a fall. This was the very hazard that was invited and foreseen.</p>
<p id="65d407f0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Volenti non fit injuria</i>. One who takes part in such a sport accepts the dangers that inhere in it so far as they are obvious and necessary, just as a fencer accepts the risk of a thrust by his antagonist or a spectator at a ball game the chance of contact with the ball. The antics of the clown are not the paces of the cloistered cleric. The rough and boisterous joke, the horseplay of the crowd, evokes its own guffaws, but they are not the pleasures of tranquility. The plaintiff was not seeking a retreat for meditation. Visitors were tumbling about the belt to the merriment of onlookers when he made his choice to join them. He took the <span title="392" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-392">p. 392</span>chance of a like fate, with whatever damage to his body might ensue from such a fall.

<p id="65d407f4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A different case would be here if the dangers inherent in the sport were obscure or unobserved or so serious as to justify the belief that precautions of some kind must have been taken to avert them. Nothing happened to the plaintiff except what common experience tells us may happen at any time as the consequence of a sudden fall. Many a skater or a horseman can rehearse a tale of equal woe. A different case there would also be if the accidents had been so many as to show that the game in its inherent nature was too dangerous to be continued without change. The president of the amusement company says that there had never been such an accident before. A nurse employed at an emergency hospital maintained in connection with the park contradicts him to some extent. She says that on other occasions she had attended patrons of the park who had been injured at the Flopper, how many she could not say. None, however, had been badly injured or had suffered broken bones. Such testimony is not enough to show that the game was a trap for the unwary, too perilous to be endured. According to the defendant’s estimate, two hundred and fifty thousand visitors were at the Flopper in a year. Some quota of accidents was to be looked for in so great a mass. One might as well say that a skating rink should be abandoned because skaters sometimes fall.</p>

In a case involving primary assumption of the risk, it is possible to allege as well that the plaintiff took some unreasonable risk of harm in participating in an obviously dangerous activity. But primary assumption of the risk is not focused upon blaming the plaintiff for participating voluntarily in some risky endeavor. The focal point is on the activity itself, or at least defendant’s provision of that activity. What is it about the activity of riding an amusement park ride like the Flopper that causes the court to invoke the doctrine?</p>

The <i>Tarasoff</i> rule and the <i>Dillon</i> rule are both examples of this we have just covered earlier in this chapter. Do you see how with regard to primary assumption of the risk, the foreseeability of the potential harm is actually used to eliminate any duty of care? Why would this be true in this area?</p>

<p id="65d42f12-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff Margaret Clover sought to recover damages for injuries sustained as the result of a ski accident in which Chris Zulliger, an employee of defendant Snowbird Corporation (“Snowbird”), collided with her. From the entry of summary judgment in favor of defendants, Clover appeals.</p>
<p id="65d42f13-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the time of the accident, Chris Zulliger was employed by Snowbird as a chef at the Plaza Restaurant…which was located at the base of the resort, and the Mid-Gad Restaurant, which was located halfway to the top of the mountain.</p>
<p id="65d42f14-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On December 5, 1985, the date of the accident, Zulliger was scheduled to begin work at the Plaza Restaurant. Prior to beginning work, he had planned to go skiing…. Snowbird preferred that their employees know how to ski because it made it easier for them to get to and from work.</p>
<p id="65d45525-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Zulliger skied four runs before heading down the mountain to work. On his final run he] took a route that was often taken by Snowbird employees to travel from the top of the mountain to the Plaza. About mid-way down the mountain, at a point above the Mid-Gad, Zulliger decided to take a jump off a crest on the side of an intermediate run. He had taken this jump many times before. A skier moving relatively quickly is able to become airborne at that point because of the steep drop off on the downhill side of the crest. Due to this drop off, it is impossible for skiers above the crest to see skiers below the crest. The jump was well known to Snowbird. In fact, the Snowbird ski patrol often instructed people not to jump off the crest. There was also a sign instructing skiers to ski slowly at this point in the run. Zulliger, however, ignored the sign and skied over the crest at a significant speed. Clover, who had just entered the same ski run from a point below the crest, either had stopped or was traveling slowly below the crest. When Zulliger went over the jump, he collided with Clover, who was hit in the head and severely injured.</p>
<p id="65d45526-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Clover brought claims against Zulliger and Snowbird, alleging that [Snowbird was negligent in designing and maintaining its ski runs and Zulliger was negligent in his manner of skiing]. Zulliger settled separately with Clover. [By summary judgment,] the trial judge dismissed Clover’s claims against Snowbird [because] Utah’s Inherent Risk of Skiing Statute, <i>Utah Code Ann. §§78-27-51 to -54</i> (Supp. 1986), bars plaintiff’s claim of negligent design and maintenance….</p>
<p id="65d45527-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court dismissed Clover’s negligent design and maintenance claim on the ground that such a claim is barred by Utah’s Inherent Risk of Skiing Statute, <i>Utah Code Ann. §§78-27-51 to -54</i> (Supp. 1986). This ruling was based on the trial court’s findings that “Clover was injured as a result of a collision with another skier, and/or the variation of steepness in terrain.” Apparently, the trial court reasoned that regardless of a ski resort’s culpability, the resort is not <span title="394" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-394">p. 394</span>liable for an injury occasioned by one or more of the dangers listed in section 78-27-52(1).

<p id="65d4552d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As used in this act:</p>
<p id="65d4552e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(1) “Inherent risk of skiing” means those dangers or conditions which are an integral part of the sport of skiing, including, but not limited to: changing weather conditions, variations or steepness in terrain; snow or ice conditions; surface or subsurface conditions such as bare spots, forest growth, rocks, stumps, impact with lift towers and other structures and their components; collisions with other skiers; and a skier’s failure to ski within his own ability.</p></div>
<p id="65d4552f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is clear that [these sections] protect ski area operators from suits initiated by their patrons who seek recovery for injuries caused by an inherent risk of skiing. The statute, however, does not purport to grant ski area operators complete immunity from all negligence claims initiated by skiers. While the general parameters of the act are clear, application of the statute to specific circumstances is less certain. In the instant case, both parties urge different interpretations of the act. Snowbird claims that any injury occasioned by one or more of the dangers listed in section 78-27-52(1) is barred by the statute because, as a matter of law, such an accident is caused by an inherent risk of skiing. Clover, on the other hand, argues that a ski area operator’s negligence is not an inherent risk of skiing and that if the resort’s negligence causes a collision between skiers, a suit arising from that collision is not barred by [the statute].</p>
<p id="65d45530-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the trial court apparently agreed with Snowbird, we decline to adopt such an interpretation. The basis of Snowbird’s argument is that the language of section 78-27-52(1) stating that “‘inherent risk of skiing means those dangers or conditions which are an integral part of the sport of skiing, including but not limited to:…collision with other skiers” must be read as defining all collisions between skiers as inherent risks. The wording of the statute does not compel such a reading. To the contrary, the dangers listed in section 78-27-52(1) are modified by the term “integral part of the sport of skiing.” Therefore, ski area operators are protected from suits to recover for injuries caused by one or more of the dangers listed in section 78-27-52(1) only to the extent that those dangers, under the facts of each case, are integral aspects of the sport of skiing. Indeed, <span title="395" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-395">p. 395</span>the list of dangers in section 78-27-52(1) is expressly nonexclusive. The statute, therefore, contemplates that the determination of whether a risk is inherent be made on a case-by-case basis, using the entire statute, not solely the list provided in section 78-27-52(1).</p>
<p id="65d45531-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Inasmuch as the purpose of the statute is to “clarify the law,” not to radically alter ski resort liability, it is necessary to briefly examine the relevant law at the time the statute was enacted. Although there is limited Utah case law on point, when the statute was enacted the majority of jurisdictions employed the doctrine of primary assumption of risk in limiting ski resorts’ liability for injuries their patrons received while skiing. Terms utilized in the statute such as “inherent risk of skiing” and “assumes the risk” are the same terms relied upon in such cases. This language suggests that the statute is meant to achieve the same results achieved under the doctrine of primary assumption of risk. In fact, commentators suggest that the statute was passed in reaction to a perceived erosion in the protection ski area operators traditionally enjoyed under the common law doctrine of primary assumption of risk.</p>
<p id="65d45532-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As we have noted in the past, the single term “assumption of risk” has been used to refer to several different, and occasionally overlapping, concepts. One concept, primary assumption of risk, is simply “an alternative expression for the proposition that the defendant was not negligent, that is, there was no duty owed or there was no breach of an existing duty.” This suggests that the statute, in clarifying the “confusion as to whether a skier assumes the risks inherent in the sport of skiing,” operates to define the duty ski resorts owe to their patrons.</p>
<p id="65d45533-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, it is to be noted that without a duty, there can be no negligence. Such an interpretation, therefore, harmonizes the express purpose of the statute, protecting ski area operators from suits arising out of injuries caused by the inherent risks of skiing, with the fact that the statute does not purport to abrogate a skier’s traditional right to recover for injuries caused by ski area operators’ negligence.</p>
<p id="65d45534-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A similar analysis leads to the conclusion that the [duty this statute imposes] on ski resorts [includes] the duty to use reasonable care for the protection of its patrons…. [H]owever, a ski area operator is under no duty to protect its patrons from the inherent risks of skiing. The inherent risks of skiing are those dangers that skiers wish to confront as essential characteristics of the sport of skiing or hazards that cannot be eliminated by the exercise of ordinary care on the part of the ski area operator.</p>
<p id="65d47c45-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The term “inherent risk of skiing,” refers to those risks that are essential characteristics of skiing—risks that are so integrally related to skiing that the sport cannot be undertaken without confronting these risks. Generally, these risks can be divided into two categories. The first category of risks consists of those risks, such as steep grades, powder, and mogul runs, which skiers wish to confront as an essential characteristic of skiing. Under sections 78-27-51 to -54, a ski area operator is under no duty to make all of its runs as safe as possible by eliminating the type of dangers that skiers wish to confront as an integral part of skiing.</p>
<p id="65d47c46-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second category of risks consists of those hazards which no one wishes to confront but cannot be alleviated by the use of reasonable care on the part of <span title="396" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-396">p. 396</span>a ski resort. It is without question that skiing is a dangerous activity. Hazards may exist in locations where they are not readily discoverable. Weather and snow conditions can suddenly change and, without warning, create new hazards where no hazard previously existed. Hence, it is clearly foreseeable that a skier, without skiing recklessly, may momentarily lose control or fall in an unexpected manner. Ski area operators cannot alleviate these risks, and under sections 78-27-51 to -54, they are not liable for injuries caused by such risks…. This does not mean, however, that a ski area operator is under no duty to use ordinary care to protect its patrons. In fact, if an injury was caused by an unnecessary hazard that could have been eliminated by the use of ordinary care, such a hazard is not, in the ordinary sense of the term, an inherent risk of skiing and would fall outside of sections 78-27-51 to -54.</p>
<p id="65d47c47-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having established the proper interpretation of sections 78-27-51 to -54, the next step is to determine whether, given this interpretation, there is a genuine issue of material fact in regard to Clover’s claim. First, the existence of a blind jump with a landing area located at a point where skiers enter the run is not an essential characteristic of an intermediate run. Therefore, Clover may recover if she can prove that Snowbird could have prevented the accident through the use of ordinary care. It is to be noted that Clover’s negligent design and maintenance claim is not based solely on the allegation that Snowbird allowed conditions to exist on an intermediate hill which caused blind spots and allowed skiers to jump. Rather, Clover presents evidence that Snowbird was aware that its patrons regularly took the jump, that the jump created an unreasonable hazard to skiers below the jump, and that Snowbird did not take reasonable measures to eliminate the hazard. This evidence is sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact in regard to Clover’s negligent design and maintenance claim.</p>
<p id="65d47c48-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In light of the genuine issues of material fact in regard to each of Clover’s claims, summary judgment was inappropriate.</p>

<p id="65d47c4c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Inherent Dangers.</i></b> The statute in Utah referred both to collisions with other skiers and changes in terrain as inherent dangers of snow skiing. The court clarified, however, that only some collisions and some changes in terrain were actually inherent dangers. The court then identifies two types of inherent dangers: positive dangers that are desirable, and negative dangers that can’t reasonably be avoided without fundamentally changing the sport or activity.

But in recent years, Major League Baseball teams have begun extending the netting further around the stadium (past the dugout areas) after a series of well publicized and serious injuries, including one to a young child at the New York Yankees’ stadium during the summer of 2017. After these changes, would a fan attending a baseball game at a stadium that had not yet extended the netting and who gets hit sitting behind the dugout, be in a better position to argue that this activity no longer constituted a primary assumption of the risk?</p>

<p id="65d4a365-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Primary assumption of the risk is just a particular way that a court can declare as a matter of law that the defendant is not liable to the plaintiff in negligence, either because there was no duty to prevent harms associated with inherent risks, or because there was no unreasonable conduct by the defendant. It is technically not an affirmative defense but simply another way of saying that the plaintiff has failed to prove negligence. It applies when the particular risk is either desirable or not one that can be avoided through the exercise of reasonable care. The modern inquiry focuses not so much upon the plaintiff’s awareness, but more upon the nature of the activity and the defendant’s conduct. In Chapter 7, we will learn about two true defenses that share a common name—secondary implied assumption of the risk and express assumption of the risk.</p>

<p id="65d4ca7d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Trespassers occupy a least-favored status among all of the entrants to another’s property. This stems from the strong tradition in the common law to respect the property rights of citizens. You may recall in Chapter 2 that it was relatively easy to be labeled a trespasser (even if acting in good faith) so long as you were on the land of another without their permission. Further, as a trespasser your liability was quite broad—unburdened by any proximate cause limitations. Most jurisdictions have held that, therefore, a landowner owes only minimal duties toward a trespasser—the duty to refrain from gross negligence (“willful or wanton misconduct”). This limited duty is subject to modification. In the case of trespassers who have stepped onto the defendant’s property with sinister intentions, arguably even a lesser duty applies, as we will see in the <i>Ryals</i> case below. In the case of child trespassers, however, courts will sometimes elevate the duty of care owed under the <i>attractive nuisance doctrine</i>. This is explored in the <i>Stanley</i> case.</p>

<p id="65d4ca86-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Wilson Ryals, Jr., as administrator of the estate of his brother, David Ryals, appeals from a summary judgment in favor of the defendant, United States Steel Corporation (“U.S. Steel”). The plaintiff alleged that the defendant caused the decedent’s death by negligently or wantonly failing to maintain and secure a “switch rack” [something akin to an electrical substation]. Ryals later voluntarily <span title="399" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-399">p. 399</span>dismissed the negligence claim, and the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of U.S. Steel on the wantonness claim.</p>
<p id="65d4ca87-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because this Court, by this opinion, recognizes two distinct classes of trespassers to land—(1) mere trespassers, to whom the landowner owes the duty not to wantonly injure them; and (2) trespassers who enter upon the land of another with the manifest intent to commit a criminal act and to whom the landowner owes only the duty not to intentionally injure them—we affirm the judgment.</p>
<p id="65d4ca88-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On March 31, 1984, Wilson and David Ryals, as trespassers, went to U.S. Steel’s Muscoda Mines switch rack for the purpose of “stripping out” copper, brass, and other salvageable metals. Wilson Ryals testified at his deposition that, when they arrived at the site, they found the base of the structure to be partially stripped; that they found one rusty warning sign, detached metals lying on the ground, dangling wires, garbage in and around the fenced area and wild vegetation growing around the fence; and that they found the gate leading into the switch rack to be “wide open.” David Ryals contacted a 44,000-volt copper line; he suffered third degree burns over 95% of his body and died several days later as a result.</p>
<p id="65d4ca89-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The only issue presented here is whether U.S. Steel was entitled to a summary judgment under the appropriate standard of care owed by U.S. Steel to David Ryals, as a trespasser, who, at the time of his injury, was engaged in the crime of theft of U.S. Steel’s property.</p>
<p id="65d4ca8a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Necessarily antecedent to any evaluation of the facts, however, is a determination of the legal duty owed by a landowner to a trespasser. David Ryals was, without question, a trespasser. The standard of care that a landowner owes to a trespasser is generally recognized as the lowest standard of care owed to one who enters upon another’s land. The landowner is bound only to refrain from reckless, willful, or wanton conduct toward the trespasser. <i>Copeland v. Pike Liberal Arts School</i>, 553 So. 2d 100 (Ala. 1989).</p>
<p id="65d4f19b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is noteworthy that the highest degree of care imposed upon a landowner by this traditional common law rule toward a <i>mere</i> trespasser, i.e., one who wrongfully comes upon the land of another but without any motive, design, or intent to engage in further wrongful conduct, is not to recklessly or wantonly injure that person. Ryals does not contend otherwise; rather, he argues that the facts, when construed most favorably to him, support a finding of wantonness on the part of U.S. Steel, and, thus, that summary judgment was inappropriate. Admittedly, if all trespassers are to be treated equally, and if we agree that the conduct of U.S. Steel amounted to wantonness, then the summary judgment is due to be reversed.</p>
<p id="65d4f19c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Wantonness” has been defined by this Court as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65d4f19d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Wantonness is] the conscious doing of some act or the omission of some duty under the knowledge of the existing conditions, and conscious that from the doing of such act or omission of such duty injury will likely or probably result.</p></div>

<p id="65d4f19f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ryals contends that a genuine issue of material fact was presented on the question whether U.S. Steel wantonly caused the death of David Ryals. Ryals bases his wantonness argument primarily on his claim that when he and his brother arrived at the site they found it in the condition hereinabove set out. He also points out that agents of U.S. Steel acknowledged in deposition and in answers to interrogatories that there had been two prior deaths at the same switch rack under similar circumstances. He maintains, in light of those alleged and admitted facts, that the factfinder could reasonably infer that U.S. Steel had actual or constructive notice that persons might come into contact with the electrical lines at the switch rack.</p>
<p id="65d4f1a0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree; if reckless or wanton conduct is the appropriate standard of care applicable to these facts, then a jury question has been presented as to U.S. Steel’s conduct. We believe, however, that these facts strongly demonstrate a public policy justification for lowering the requisite degree of care due from a landowner to one who, as here, wrongfully enters upon the land of another to commit a crime. For public policy reasons, therefore, we hold that the duty owed by a landowner to an adult trespasser who comes upon the land and is injured while committing a crime is the duty not to <i>intentionally</i> injure such trespasser.</p>
<p id="65d4f1a1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying this standard to the full context of the instant case, we conclude that a fact question was not presented on the issue whether U.S. Steel intentionally caused the death of David Ryals. The switch rack was surrounded by a chain link fence topped with barbed wire. On the fence surrounding the switch rack there was at least one sign warning of the electrical danger within. Given these conspicuous indications of danger, an unlocked gate would not imperil a person unless that person elected to disregard the obvious danger presented by the electricity. In summary, the evidence, as a matter of law, fails to suggest that U.S. Steel breached its duty not to intentionally injure David Ryals, who undisputedly, at the time of his injury, was an adult illegally upon U.S. Steel’s property for the purpose of stealing copper wire.</p>
<p id="65d4f1a2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is due to be, and it hereby is, affirmed.</p>

First, that trespassers are simply disliked or disfavored and, as a matter of justice, should not be entitled to the same protections as one permitted to be on the property. Second, that they are less foreseeable than the invited or permitted guest. Given that they might happen onto the land at any time, day or night, and without notice, it would create an undue burden on the owner to anticipate and prepare the land for their safe entry.</p>

What seems to be the justification for doing so? By saying there is only a duty not to intentionally injure the trespasser, the court is really taking such liability out of the realm of accidental torts altogether. To create liability under this standard, the defendant would have to have committed a battery. On the other hand, we have previously seen in Chapter 3 that conduct that would otherwise constitute a battery can be justified to protect property. If the landowner in <i>Ryals</i> had set up the electrical substation in order to purposefully injure the plaintiff, for the protection of its property, would this have been justified? Recall the holding of the court in the <i>Katko</i> (spring gun) case in that chapter.</p>

<p id="65d518ba-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">When the injured plaintiff is a child trespasser, courts face countervailing feelings. On the one hand, the common law still favors landowners and disfavors those who commit trespass. These feelings justify in part the lower duty owed to such tortfeasors by landowners. But on the other hand, the law seeks to protect and promote the interests of children. So when a child trespasser is injured on another’s property and sues that landowner, courts stand in the crossroads of these conflicting principles and emotions. The common law has developed the <i>attractive nuisance doctrine</i> as its compromise answer to this dilemma.</p>

We resolve the question by adopting the attractive nuisance doctrine set forth in <i>Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1965), Section 339</i>.

<p id="65d53fd2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When Rickey G. Bennett, plaintiff-appellant, arrived home in the late afternoon of March 20, 1997, he found his two young daughters crying. The three-year-old, Kyleigh, told him that “Mommy” and Chance, her five-year-old half-brother, were “drowning in the water.” Bennett ran next door to his neighbors’ house to find mother and son unconscious in the swimming pool. Both died.</p>
<p id="65d53fd3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Bennetts had moved next door to defendants-appellees, Jeffrey and Stacey Stanley, in the fall of 1996. The Stanleys had purchased their home the previous June. At the time of their purchase, the Stanleys’ property included a swimming pool that had gone unused for three years. At that time, the pool was enclosed with fencing and a brick wall. After moving in, the Stanleys drained the pool once but thereafter they allowed rainwater to accumulate in the pool to a depth of over six feet. They removed a tarp that had been on the pool and also removed the fencing that had been around two sides of the pool. The pool became pond-like: it contained tadpoles and frogs, and Mr. Stanley had seen a snake swimming on the surface. The pool contained no ladders, and its sides were slimy with algae.</p>
<p id="65d53fd4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Stanleys were aware that the Bennetts had moved next door and that they had young children. They had seen the children outside unsupervised. Stacey Stanley had once called Chance onto her property to retrieve a dog. The Stanleys testified, however, that they never had any concern about the children getting into the pool. They did not post any warning or “no trespassing” signs on their property.</p>
<p id="65d53fd5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rickey Bennett testified that he had told his children to stay away from the pool on the Stanleys’ property. He also stated that he had never seen the children playing near the pool.</p>
<p id="65d53fd6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Kyleigh told her father that she and Chance had been playing at the pool on the afternoon of the tragedy. The sheriff’s department concluded that Chance had gone to the pool to look at the frogs and somehow fell into the pool. His mother apparently drowned trying to save him.</p>
<p id="65d53fd7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Bennett alleged [in his complaint] that appellees had negligently maintained an abandoned swimming pool on their property and that appellees’ negligence proximately caused the March 20, 1997 drowning of Chance and Cher. Appellant averred that appellees had created a dangerous condition by negligently maintaining the pool and that appellees reasonably should have known that the pool posed an unreasonable risk of serious harm to others. Appellant specifically alleged that appellees’ pool created an unreasonable risk of harm to children who, because of their youth, would not realize the potential danger. Appellant further asserted that appellees’ conduct in maintaining the pool constituted willful and wanton misconduct such as to justify an award of punitive damages.</p>
<p id="65d53fd8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted on September 4, 1998. The trial court found that Chance and Cher were trespassers on appellees’ property and that appellees therefore owed them only a duty to refrain from wanton and willful misconduct. As the <span title="403" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-403">p. 403</span>complaint alleged that appellees had violated a duty of ordinary care, the court found for the Stanleys as a matter of law.</p>
<p id="65d53fd9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On appeal, the appellate court affirmed the trial court’s granting of summary judgment. It, too, held that appellees owed the decedents only a duty to refrain from wanton and willful misconduct, and added that there was no evidence of such misconduct. The appellate court also addressed the issue of appellees’ duty to Cher Bennett. The court held that even if she were on the Stanleys’ property in an attempt to rescue Chance, she would still have the status only of a licensee [to whom the Stanleys would not owe a duty of reasonable care].</p>
<p id="65d53fda-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ohio has long recognized a range of duties for property owners vis-a-vis persons entering their property. Currently, to an invitee the landowner owes a duty “to exercise ordinary care and to protect the invitee by maintaining the premises in a safe condition.” <i>Light v. Ohio Univ.</i> (1986), 28 Ohio St. 3d 66, 68, 28 Ohio B. Rep. 165, 167, 502 N.E.2d 611, 613. To…trespassers, on the other hand, “a landowner owes no duty…except to refrain from willful, wanton or reckless conduct which is likely to injure [the trespasser].” <i>Gladon</i>, 75 Ohio St. 3d at 317, 662 N.E.2d at 293. Today, we face the issue of whether child trespassers should become another class of users who are owed a different duty of care.</p>
<p id="65d566eb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This court has consistently held that children have a special status in tort law and that duties of care owed to children are different from duties owed to adults….</p>
<p id="65d566ec-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recognizing the special status of children in the law, this court has even accorded special protection to child trespassers by adopting the “dangerous instrumentality” doctrine:</p>
<p id="65d566ed-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“The dangerous instrumentality exception [to nonliability to trespassers] imposes upon the owner or occupier of a premises a higher duty of care to a child trespasser when such owner or occupier actively and negligently operates hazardous machinery or other apparatus, the dangerousness of which is not readily apparent to children.” <i>McKinney v. Hartz &amp; Restle Realtors, Inc</i>. (1987), 510 N.E.2d 386, 390.</p>
<p id="65d566ee-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That doctrine was developed in <i>Coy v. Columbus, Delaware &amp; Marion Elec. Co.</i> (1932), 125 Ohio St. 283, 181 N.E. 131, a case where a six-year-old boy was injured when he touched a high voltage transformer owned by the defendant and located in a vacant lot known to be frequented by children. The court applied a negligence standard to the behavior of the company, despite the fact that the child had been trespassing.</p>
<p id="65d566ef-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, the court adopted as early as 1932 some of the hallmarks of the attractive nuisance doctrine. Elements such as knowledge of children’s presence, the maintenance of a potentially dangerous force, and an exercise of care by the owner commensurate with the danger are a part of the attractive nuisance doctrine in most states, as reflected in Section 339 of the Restatement of Torts.</p>
<p id="65d566f0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite the fact that in premises liability cases a landowner’s duty is defined by the status of the plaintiff, and that children, even child trespassers, are <span title="404" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-404">p. 404</span>accorded special protection in Ohio tort law, this court has never adopted the attractive nuisance doctrine.

<p id="65d566f7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This court has never explicitly rejected the Restatement version of the doctrine, which was adopted in 1965. Instead, Ohio’s tradition in this area of the law is based upon this court’s rejection in 1907 of the “turntable doctrine.”</p>
<p id="65d566f8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The “turntable doctrine” was a somewhat controversial doctrine wherein railroads could be liable to children for injuries suffered on unguarded railroad turntables. The theory of liability was established in <i>Sioux City &amp; Pacific RR. Co. v. Stout</i> (1873), 84 U.S. (17 Wall.) 657, 21 L. Ed. 745, and had been adopted by many states as of 1907. The burning question for many years was whether to apply the doctrine to non-turntable cases. Many of the states that adopted the turntable doctrine refused to apply it to cases not involving turntables. <i>Id.</i> at 245, 83 N.E. at 69-70.</p>
<p id="65d566f9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, the theory of liability has evolved since 1907. The Restatement of the Law, Torts (1934) and Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1965) removed legal fictions and imposed balancing factors to consider on behalf of landowners. Comment, The Restatement’s Attractive Nuisance Doctrine: An Attractive Alternative for Ohio, 46 Ohio St. L.J. 135, 138-139 (1985). Ohio’s refusal to recognize the turntable doctrine in 1907 was not a serious anomaly at the time; today, our failure to adopt the attractive nuisance doctrine is.</p>
<p id="65d566fa-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ohio is one of only three states that have not either created a special duty for trespassing children or done away with distinctions of duty based upon a person’s status as an invitee, licensee, or trespasser. <i>Kessler v.

<p id="65d58e0e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We therefore use this case to adopt the attractive nuisance doctrine contained in Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1965) §339. In doing so, we do not abandon the differences in duty a landowner owes to the different classes of users. In this case we simply further recognize that children are entitled to a greater level of protection than adults are. We remove the “distinctions without differences” between the dangerous instrumentality doctrine and the attractive nuisance doctrine. Whether an apparatus or a condition of property is involved, the key element should be whether there is a foreseeable, “unreasonable risk of death or serious bodily harm to children.” Restatement, §339(b).</p>
<p id="65d58e0f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Restatement’s version of the attractive nuisance doctrine balances society’s interest in protecting children with the rights of landowners to enjoy their property. Even when a landowner is found to have an attractive nuisance on his or her land, the landowner is left merely with the burden of acting with ordinary care. A landowner does not automatically become liable for any injury a child trespasser may suffer on that land.</p>
<p id="65d58e10-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The requirement of foreseeability is built into the doctrine. The landowner must know or have reason to know that children are likely to trespass upon the part of the property that contains the dangerous condition. <i>See</i> Section 339(a). Moreover, the landowner’s duty “does not extend to those conditions the existence of which is obvious even to children and the risk of which should be fully realized by them.” <i>Id</i>. at Comment <i>i</i>. Also, if the condition of the property that poses the risk is essential to the landowner, the doctrine would not apply:</p>
<p id="65d58e11-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“The public interest in the possessor’s free use of his land for his own purposes is of great significance. A particular condition is, therefore, regarded as not involving unreasonable risk to trespassing children unless it involves a grave risk to them which could be obviated without any serious interference with the possessor’s legitimate use of his land.” <i>Id.</i> at Comment <i>n</i>.</p>
<p id="65d58e12-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are satisfied that the Restatement view effectively harmonizes the competing societal interests of protecting children and preserving property rights. In adopting the attractive nuisance doctrine, we acknowledge that the way we live <span title="406" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-406">p. 406</span>now is different from the way we lived in 1907, when <i>Harvey</i> was decided. We are not a rural society any longer, our neighbors live closer, and our use of our own property affects others more than it once did.</p>
<p id="65d58e13-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite our societal changes, children are still children. They still learn through their curiosity. They still have developing senses of judgment. They still do not always appreciate danger. They still need protection by adults. Protecting children in a changing world requires the common law to adapt. Today, we make that change.</p>
<p id="65d58e14-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, we add that on remand should the facts establish that the attractive nuisance doctrine applies in this case, that finding would also affect the duty of care the appellees owed to Cher Bennett if Cher entered the property to rescue her son.</p>
<p id="65d58e15-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On remand, the evidence may establish that Cher’s status was that of a rescuer. This court has held pertaining to rescuers that “if the rescuer does not rashly and unnecessarily expose himself to danger, and is injured, the injury should be attributed to the party that negligently, or wrongfully, exposed to danger, the person who required assistance.” <i>Pennsylvania Co. v</i>. <i>Langendorf</i>, 28 N.E. 172 (Ohio 1891), paragraph three of the syllabus. While the attractive nuisance doctrine is not ordinarily applicable to adults, it “may be successfully invoked by an adult seeking damages for his or her own injury if the injury was suffered in an attempt to rescue a child from a danger created by the defendant’s negligence.” 62 American Jurisprudence 2d (1990), Premises Liability §288. Therefore, we hold that if Cher Bennett entered the Stanleys’ property to rescue her son from an attractive nuisance, the Stanleys owed her a duty of ordinary care.</p>
<p id="65d5b526-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the cause to the trial court.</p>

<p id="65d5b528-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The majority errs in deciding to change Ohio law by adopting the attractive nuisance doctrine in a case where the plaintiffs failed to preserve the issue by properly raising it in the trial court.]</p>
<p id="65d5b529-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if the Bennetts had properly preserved the attractive nuisance issue for our review, I would decline to join the majority’s second syllabus paragraph. The majority holds, without citation of any supporting case law, that an <i>adult</i> may successfully invoke the attractive nuisance doctrine if the adult suffered injury “in an attempt to rescue a child from a danger created by the defendant’s negligence.” Yet this extension of the doctrine is unnecessary to assure recovery for an adult who sustains injury in an attempt to rescue a child placed in danger by the tortfeasor’s negligence. As the majority correctly observes, a person injured during an attempted rescue may recover from the party negligently causing the danger to the same extent as the person who required assistance from the rescuer. <i>See Pittsburg, Cincinnati, Chicago &amp; St. Louis Ry. Co. v. Lynch</i>, 68 N.E. 703 (1903). This “rescue doctrine” has long been a part of Ohio’s common law. Thus, a possessor of land who is liable to a child under the attractive nuisance doctrine is also liable for injuries suffered by the adult rescuer of the child. But this <span title="407" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-407">p. 407</span>liability is predicated on a straightforward application of the rescue doctrine and not on any extension of the attractive nuisance doctrine to cover adults.</p>

<div class="epub-heading cc-font-xlarge left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="65d5b52b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b">NOTES AND PROBLEMS</p></h3></div>
<p id="65d5b52c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Origins of the Attractive Nuisance Doctrine.</i></b> The court in <i>Stanley</i> discusses the <i>turntable doctrine</i>. This was a product of the nineteenth century that arose out of a concern for children who were trespassing onto railroad property and getting hurt on turntables. These were devices designed to turn locomotives around to face a different direction. Because the children were coming onto the property “attracted” to the dangerous condition (the turntables), and the railroads were able to anticipate their presence and take precautions, courts treated these child trespassers differently than adults and required reasonable precautions to be taken.</p>
<p id="65d5b52d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Artificial Conditions.</i></b> Notice that the language of the Restatement limits application of the doctrine to manmade conditions on the defendant’s land. It is this limitation that has led some courts to conclude that the attractive nuisance doctrine should not apply to swimming pools because water is a natural hazard—something “reasonably to be expected to be fully understood and appreciated by any child of an age allowed at large.” Restatement (Second) §339, cmt. j (1965). The <i>Stanley</i> court apparently did not agree with this comment from the Restatement.</p>
<p id="65d5b52e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>The Rescue Doctrine.</i></b> The majority in <i>Stanley</i> held that, in addition to the child, the parent coming to the aid of the child should also have the same duty of care extended to them. The dissent disagrees with this extension of the attractive nuisance doctrine to any adult, particularly because it believed that the traditional <i>rescue doctrine</i>, covered earlier in this chapter, would yield the same result.</p>
<p id="65d5b52f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Changing Status.</i></b> Courts have held that just because someone enters land with one status does not mean they retain that status regardless of the circumstances. <i>See e.g.</i>, Gladon v. Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority, 662 N.E.2d 287 (Ohio 1996) (plaintiff who held a ticket to ride defendant’s train was no longer an invitee when he left public areas); Restatement (Second) of Torts §336 (1965) (using illustration of a train’s customer who has fallen onto the tracks and been run over, customer should be considered a trespasser because he was not permitted on the tracks). For example, if someone enters a convenience store to purchase candy but enters a back room marked “Staff Only—Not for Use by Public”—they have shifted from an invitee to a trespasser. Which set of rules to apply to their claim for personal injury would depend upon when and where their accident occurred. If in the back room, the landowner would only have to refrain from gross negligence (unless the attractive nuisance doctrine applied).</p>

<p id="65d6035d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Bonita Knorpp appeals from a directed verdict in a premises liability case. Knorpp contends that the trial court erred by finding her son, Todd Erwin, to be a licensee rather than an invitee at the time of his death and by rendering a directed verdict against her claim for damages.</p>
<span title="409" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-409">p. 409</span>
<p id="65d6035e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The decedent, Todd Erwin, was killed while cutting down a tree at the Hales’ house. The evidence shows that he had moved to Texarkana to be near the Hales’ daughter Autumn, who he had been dating for about a year, and that he spent a great deal of time at their house. The Hales were planning a New Year’s Eve bonfire at a location in a pasture near their house around the base of a dead pine tree. They decided to cut down the tree. Erwin went to the house on December 6, 1994, took the Hales’ chain saw, and began to cut down the tree. After about forty-five minutes, the tree fell in an unexpected direction and landed on Erwin, killing him.</p>
<p id="65d6035f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There was evidence that Erwin had worked with his stepfather cutting and trimming trees. The stepfather testified that Erwin did not cut the tree properly. He testified that the vertical distance between Erwin’s front and back cuts was too great; that Erwin should have used a rope to pull the tree in a particular direction and should have used wedges to direct the tree’s fall.</p>
<p id="65d60360-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When Knorpp completed the presentation of her evidence, the trial court granted the landowner’s motion for a directed verdict and ruled as a matter of law that Hale was a licensee and that there was no evidence that the landowners were negligent under applicable standards for a licensee.</p>
<p id="65d60361-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Knorpp…contends that there was evidence that Erwin was an invitee on this particular day when he came onto the property.</p>
<p id="65d60362-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The owner/operator of property owes the highest degree of care to an invitee. An invitee has been described as one who enters on another’s land with the owner’s knowledge and for the mutual benefit of both. <i>Rosas v. Buddies Food Store</i>, 518 S.W.2d 534, 536 (Tex. 1975), citing <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts §332</i> (1965)<i>.</i></p>
<p id="65d60363-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A licensee is a person who is privileged to enter or remain on land only by virtue of the possessor’s consent. <i>Dominguez v. Garcia</i>, 746 S.W.2d 865, 867 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1988, writ denied), quoting <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts §330 (1965)</i>. Thus, a licensee is one who enters with permission of the landowner, but does so for his own convenience or on business for someone other than the owner. <i>Smith v. Andrews</i>, 832 S.W.2d 395, 397 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1992, writ denied).</p>
<p id="65d60364-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A landowner owes an invitee a duty to exercise ordinary care to protect him from risks of which the owner is actually aware and those risks of which the owner should be aware after reasonable inspection. <i>Motel 6 G.P., Inc. v. Lopez</i>, 929 S.W.2d 1, 3 (Tex. 1996). To recover, a plaintiff must plead and prove that the landowner (1) had actual or constructive knowledge of some condition on the premises; (2) that the condition posed an unreasonable risk of harm; (3) that the landowner did not exercise reasonable care to reduce or eliminate the risk; and (4) that the landowner’s failure to use such care proximately caused the plaintiff’s injuries. <i>Keetch v. Kroger Co.</i>, 845 S.W.2d 262, 264 (Tex. 1992).</p>
<p id="65d60365-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The duty that an owner owes to a licensee is to not injure him by “willful, wanton or grossly negligent conduct, and that the owner use ordinary care to either warn a licensee of, or to make reasonably safe, a dangerous condition of <span title="410" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-410">p. 410</span>which the owner is aware and the licensee is not.” <i>State Dept. of Highways v. Payne</i>, 838 S.W.2d 235, 237 (Tex. 1992). In order to establish liability, a licensee must prove (1) that a condition of the premises created an unreasonable risk of harm to him; (2) that the owner actually knew of the condition; (3) that the licensee did not actually know of the condition; (4) that the owner failed to exercise ordinary care to protect the licensee from danger; and (5) that the owner’s failure was a proximate cause of injury to the licensee.</p>
<p id="65d60366-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the present case, it is admitted by all that Erwin was a regular visitor to the Hales’ house, that he had his own key to the house and came and went unsupervised, and that he was looked on as a likely son-in-law. He was clearly invited onto the property. Thus, it would appear that he should be defined as an “invitee.” This is not, however, the case. In Texas, a “social guest” is classified as a licensee. <i>Dominguez</i>, 746 S.W.2d 865; <i>McKethan v. McKethan</i>, 477 S.W.2d 357, 361 (Tex. Civ. App.—Corpus Christi 1972, writ ref’d n.r.e.). As set out above, a host owes a social guest a duty not to injure him by willful, wanton or gross negligence. <i>Lower Neches Valley Authority v. Murphy</i>, 536 S.W.2d 561, 563 (Tex. 1976).</p>
<p id="65d60367-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All of the evidence in the present case shows that the decedent was invited onto the premises, but also shows that he falls into the category of a “social guest.” In Texas, as a matter of law, he was a licensee. The trial court did not err by finding him to be a licensee.</p>
<p id="65d60368-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Knorpp…contends that this conclusion is erroneous and that the trial court erred by rendering a directed verdict in the Hales’ favor, because regardless of the decedent’s usual status, a different one existed in this particular situation. She argues that because there was a discussion, at which the decedent was present, about cutting down the tree, because Reeda Hale had asked Erwin if he was going to help her husband cut down the tree, and because Erwin was going to be present at the bonfire, then the cutting of the tree was done for the mutual advantage (or benefit) of the decedent and the landowner. This, Knorpp argues, constitutes some evidence that the decedent was an invitee and that the trial court therefore erred by finding him to be a licensee as a matter of law.</p>
<p id="65d60369-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In determining whether an individual is an invitee or a licensee, the cases typically use the language “mutual benefit” or “mutual advantage.” Knorpp argues that this term stretches so far as to include an intangible benefit, such as having the opportunity to attend or conduct the New Year’s Eve bonfire.</p>
<p id="65d62a7a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The concept behind this language was originally brought into Texas cases as a paraphrase of the predecessor of <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts §332</i> (1965). <i>Carlisle v. J. Weingarten, Inc</i>., 137 Tex. 220, 152 S.W.2d 1073, 1076 (1941); <i>See Spencer v. Dallas</i>, 819 S.W.2d 612 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1991, no writ). In <i>Carlisle</i>, the Court discussed an invitee in terms of business-related ventures exclusively, as discussed in the Restatement. Later cases discussed the necessity of determining who qualified as an invitee and cited to the Restatement and cases applying the Restatement concepts. However, instead of using the more explicit <span title="411" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-411">p. 411</span>terminology contained in <i>Section 332</i>
<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1172A_a3956e6b-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1172A_a3956e6b-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d">1</a></span> to determine whether a person was an invitee, the courts instead looked to see whether an entry was one by a person invited and to the “mutual advantage” of both parties.</p>
<p id="65d62a7f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This language does not appear in the Restatement’s description of an “invitee,” but is found in 65 C.J.S. <i>Negligence</i> §63(41) (1966). The “mutual advantage” or “mutual benefit” language found in C.J.S. has been repeated by numerous cases, including the most recent premises liability cases from this court. <i>See Dabney</i>, 953 S.W.2d at 536.</p>
<p id="65d62a80-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The two terminologies were merged in <i>Cowart v. Meeks</i>, 131 Tex. 36, 111 S.W.2d 1105 (1938), where that court discussed the business relations between the injured person and landowner as showing the nature of his invitee status, and then stating that in “the absence of some relation which inures to the <i>mutual benefit</i> of the two, or to that of the owner, no invitation can be implied, and the injured person must be regarded as a mere licensee.” <i>Crum v. Stasney</i>, 404 S.W.2d 72, 75 (Tex. Civ. App.-Eastland 1966, no writ) (emphasis added).</p>
<p id="65d62a81-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, we have the courts using language abstracted from C.J.S. as a shorthand method of describing the analysis to be used in determining whether a party qualifies for the status of “invitee,” but actually using the analysis set out in the Restatement.</p>
<p id="65d62a82-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It appears that the formula set out by the Restatement for analysis of invitee/licensee/trespasser status was adopted for use in Texas by <i>Carlisle</i>, 137 Tex. 220, 152 S.W.2d 1073, as reiterated in <i>Rosa</i>, 518 S.W.2d at 536, and that it remains the proper analysis to apply.</p>
<p id="65d62a83-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The decedent was a social guest of the landowners. He was not expecting payment for cutting down the tree, and the evidence is that no one asked him personally to do so, but that he volunteered to do so. There was no business relationship or dealing in existence or contemplated between the decedent and the landowner, and it is unquestioned that the land was not open to the public. Accordingly, as a matter of law, the decedent was not an invitee, but was a licensee on this particular occasion, and the trial court did not err by so holding.</p>
<p id="65d62a84-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Knorpp also argues that, in the alternative, there was evidence that the dead tree presented an unreasonable risk of harm and that there is at least some evidence that the landowners were negligent in failing to warn of the danger involved in cutting down the tree. This contention is based upon Knorpp’s contention that the landowners were aware of the risk of harm and failed to use reasonable care to reduce the risk…. Even if we analyze this argument as an attempt to show liability for a licensee, the attempt fails on several grounds.</p>
<span title="412" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-412">p. 412</span>
<p id="65d62a85-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the present case, the undisputed evidence is that the decedent had worked with his father trimming and felling trees and that he had at least a passing acquaintance with the dangers involved. The undisputed evidence also shows that the landowners were unaware of any special dangers involved in cutting down a dead tree. Thus, the evidence shows that the licensee was aware of the danger involved in the action that he intentionally undertook.</p>
<p id="65d62a86-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The evidence also shows that the tree itself was not a dangerous condition. The worry stated by the landowners was that if they burned it in the bonfire, it would fall on someone. Cutting the tree was the act that caused the danger.</p>
<p id="65d62a87-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Counsel attempts to compare this situation to a slip-and-fall case where the ice on the floor is not dangerous of itself—it becomes dangerous only when someone slips on it. We do not accept this basic premise. Ice on the floor is generally a dangerous condition in and of itself. A dangerous condition is one which creates a substantial risk of injury when the property is used with due care in a manner in which it is reasonably foreseeable that it will be used. It is generally foreseeable that a floor will be used by people walking, and thus, a substantial risk of injury is foreseeable. In the present case, the tree at that time was not in a condition that it was likely to fall until someone cut or burned the tree. Therefore, the dangerous condition of the tree did not occur until it was cut.</p>
<p id="65d62a88-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In summary, the condition did not exist until Erwin began cutting the tree, thus, it was not a “condition of the premises”; the owner did not know that the licensee was creating a dangerous condition; and the licensee was the one creating the condition. In light of those facts, there was nothing for the landowner to warn the licensee about, because no dangerous condition existed until it was created by the licensee and, therefore, no duty to warn was shown by the evidence.</p>
<p id="65d65199-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judgment is affirmed.</p>

<p id="65d6519c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Duty Owed to Licensees.</i></b> While the duty owed to trespassers (normally) is to refrain from gross negligence, the duty owed to invitees is to use reasonable care. The duty owed to licensees is a hybrid—with regard to dangerous activities (conducted by or under the control of the landowner), the duty is to avoid gross negligence. With regard to dangerous conditions on the land, the duty is triggered by actual knowledge of the condition. Only then does the landowner owe a duty of reasonable care to warn or remove the danger. Why did the plaintiff’s evidence in <i>Knorpp</i> fail to show a possible violation of these hybrid standards?</p>
<p id="65d6519d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Social Guests as Licensees.</i></b> The plaintiff took the position that because he had a standing invitation to be on the land that he must be considered an “invitee.” He also argues that because he removed the tree for the “mutual benefit” of the defendant, he must also be considered an invitee. Why does the <span title="413" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-413">p. 413</span>court reject both of these arguments? As between social guests and random members of the public who are enticed to come upon your land, does the landowner have a closer or “special” relationship with one more than the other? Some believe these two categories should be the opposite, with the social guest licensee owed the greater duty. The explanation usually given by the courts for the classification of social guests as licensees is that there is a common understanding that the guest is expected to take the premises as the possessor himself uses them, and does not expect and is not entitled to expect that they will be prepared for his reception. <i>See</i> Restatement (Second) of Torts §330, cmt. (h)(3) (1965). Not all courts applying the traditional rules agree with this characterization of social guests.</p>
<p id="65d6519e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Police, Firefighters, and Meter Readers.</i></b> Most courts hold, as a matter of law, that police and firefighters coming onto your land during an emergency take the status of a licensee rather than an invitee. Of course, depending on the nature of their injury the <i>firefighter rule</i> might preclude any duty whatsoever, but remember that there are limits to that doctrine’s application. Public utility meter readers are considered, by contrast, to be invitees of the landowner.</p>

This applies with respect to activities undertaken on the land. With respect to dangerous conditions, the duty of reasonable care is triggered by either actual or constructive knowledge. In cases of constructive knowledge, a common inquiry consists of determining the length of time that the dangerous condition existed without being dealt with by the owner. The following two cases discuss this triggering concept of constructive knowledge and time. <i>Commodore</i> deals with a scenario involving a ceiling that was permitted to deteriorate over a long period. The next case involves a slip and fall, a type of case where courts frequently struggle to determine the passage of time.</p>

<p id="65d678ba-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant, Russell Richardson, was injured at a bar owned and operated by the defendants/appellees when a portion of the ceiling fell on him. His suit against the defendants was dismissed on their motion for summary judgment. The court of appeals affirmed. On further review, we find sufficient evidence to <span title="414" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-414">p. 414</span>create a jury question on Richardson’s premises liability claim. Therefore, we vacate the court of appeals decision and reverse the judgment of the district court, remanding for further proceedings.</p>
<p id="65d678bb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The record shows that, at the time of Richardson’s injury, The Commodore Tap was a bar operated by the appellee, The Commodore, Inc. Appellees Ralph and Betty Hauerwas owned the corporation as well as the building in which the bar was located.</p>
<p id="65d678bc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The accident giving rise to this action occurred on September 12, 1994. While shooting pool at the bar on that date, Richardson was suddenly struck by falling plaster. Richardson thereafter brought this action against the defendants to recover damages for his physical injuries. Richardson’s claim was based on a theory of premises liability. He alleged that he was a business invitee and the collapse of the ceiling and his resulting injuries were caused by the defendants’ negligence in failing to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition.</p>
<p id="65d69fcd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The record shows that the building that housed The Commodore Tap was built in 1913. Ralph and Betty Hauerwas acquired the building in 1982, and subsequently moved their tavern business into it. The tavern was on the first floor of this two-story building. Prior to opening for business, the Hauerwases contracted with Wayne Blumer to repair portions of the plaster ceiling of the first floor where the wood lath had been exposed by the removal of some partition walls. Blumer did not notice any signs of damage to or other problems with the plaster ceiling at the time of his repairs.</p>
<p id="65d69fce-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1985, the Hauerwases installed a drop ceiling on the first floor of the building to improve the efficiency of heating and cooling the premises. They did not notice any problems with the plaster ceiling at that time. Between 1985 and the date of the accident in 1994, the Hauerwases did not inspect the plaster ceiling, were unaware of any problems in that ceiling, and made no repairs to it.</p>
<p id="65d69fcf-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is undisputed that Richardson was struck by a portion of the original (1913) plaster ceiling when the plaster separated from the lath and fell through the drop ceiling. Blumer repaired the plaster ceiling after its collapse in 1994. He estimated that a piece of ceiling measuring two feet by five feet fell. This piece was not close to the areas he had repaired in 1982. Blumer testified that the ceiling collapsed due to its age and the effect, over time, of vibration from heavy traffic on the adjoining street. He thought this particular area of the ceiling may have fallen off because it was thicker than the rest of the plaster ceiling. While making the repairs in 1994, Blumer inspected the remainder of the plaster ceiling by looking through the drop ceiling where the tiles had been pushed off by falling plaster, and using a spotlight to view whether the plaster was sagging in any other areas.</p>
<p id="65d69fd0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As noted above, Richardson’s suit is based on a theory of premises liability. The district court granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment, holding there was no evidence they knew or should have known of the dangerous condition of the plaster ceiling.</p>

<p id="65d69fd1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The general rule applicable to the liability of possessors of land for injuries caused by conditions on the land is found in the Restatement (Second) of Torts:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65d69fd2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A possessor of land is subject to liability for physical harm caused to his invitees by a condition on the land if, but only if, he</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65d69fd3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(a) knows or by the exercise of reasonable care would discover the condition, and should realize that it involves an unreasonable risk of harm to such invitees, and</p>
<p id="65d69fd4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(b) should expect that they will not discover or realize the danger, or will fail to protect themselves against it, and</p>
<p id="65d69fd5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(c) fails to exercise reasonable care to protect them against the danger.</p></div></div>
<p id="65d69fd6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush"><i>Restatement (Second) of Torts §343</i>, at 215-16 (1965). The parties do not dispute Richardson’s status as an invitee nor the defendants’ status as possessors of the land. The dispute in this case centers on the requirement that the defendants know of the dangerous condition or by the exercise of reasonable care should have known of the condition.</p>
<p id="65d69fd7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although Richardson does not contend that the defendants had actual knowledge of the condition of the plaster ceiling, he argues that this knowledge should be imputed to them because the defendants created the dangerous condition by installing the drop ceiling. Alternatively, he claims that if the defendants had exercised reasonable care in inspecting the plaster ceiling, they would have discovered the condition of the ceiling. We discuss these issues separately.</p>
<p id="65d69fd8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Knowledge of a dangerous condition is imputed to a possessor of land who has created the condition that causes the plaintiff’s injury. <i>See Ling v. Hosts, Inc.</i>, 164 N.W.2d 123, 126 (Iowa 1969); <i>Smith v. Cedar Rapids Country Club</i>, 255 Iowa 1199, 1210, 124 N.W.2d 557, 564 (1963). For example, in <i>Smith</i>, the plaintiff was injured when she slipped and fell on a floor that had been waxed to an uneven and extremely slippery finish. There was no dispute that the defendant had applied the finish to the floor. We stated that when “the condition has been created by the owner[,]…he will not be heard to deny he had notice of it.” <i>Id.</i> at 567.</p>
<p id="65d69fd9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This rule does not, however, help the plaintiff here. There is no evidence that the defendants created the condition in the plaster ceiling <i>that caused it to fall</i>. The defendants merely installed a drop ceiling over the plaster ceiling, and there is nothing in the record to indicate that the drop ceiling contributed in any way to the collapse of the plaster ceiling. Therefore, knowledge of the dangerous condition in the plaster ceiling cannot be imputed to the defendants.</p>
<p id="65d69fda-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendants’ duty of reasonable care as possessors of the premises extends to an inspection of the premises to discover any dangerous conditions or latent defects, “‘followed by such repair, safeguards, or warning as may be reasonably necessary for [the invitee’s] protection under the circumstances.’” <i>Wieseler v. Sisters of Mercy Health Corp.</i>, 540 N.W.2d 445, 450 (Iowa 1995) (quoting <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts §343 cmt. b</i>, at 216). The action necessary to satisfy this duty of reasonable care depends upon “the nature of the land and the purposes for which it is used.” <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts §343 cmt. e</i>, at 217. <span title="416" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-416">p. 416</span>“The duty of one who operates a place of entertainment or amusement is higher than that of the owner of private property generally.” <i>Grall v. Meyer</i>, 173 N.W.2d 61, 63 (Iowa 1969).</p>
<p id="65d69fdb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[In this case, the facts] could support a jury finding that reasonable care warranted an inspection. Although the plaster ceiling had not collapsed in the past, the defendants were aware of the age of the ceiling (it was built in 1913), and they should have realized that a falling ceiling posed a serious danger to their patrons. Even more important, an inspection was not an onerous and impractical burden.…Here, with a ladder and a flashlight, the defendants could have conducted periodic inspections by simply lifting a ceiling tile in the drop ceiling and viewing the original ceiling, as Blumer did after the accident in 1994. We think these facts…provide an evidentiary basis for a jury finding that the defendants’ duty of reasonable care included inspection for hidden defects in the plaster ceiling.</p>
<p id="65d6c6ec-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, a failure to inspect is relevant only to the extent such an inspection would have revealed the defect in the ceiling. <i>See Restatement (Second) of Torts §343</i>, at 215 (imposing liability only if the possessor knew or <i>would have discovered</i> the defect in the exercise of reasonable care). The record in this case shows that the plaster ceiling fell because the plaster separated from the wood lath. In addition, the record reveals that the cause of this separation was vibration of the ceiling over many years caused by traffic outside the building. We think the jury could make a common-sense inference from this evidence that the separation would not occur instantly, but that the plaster would gradually separate over time and begin to sag, thereby resulting in an appearance observable to someone looking at the ceiling. In fact, the repairman, Blumer, testified that was exactly what he was looking for when he inspected the ceiling after Richardson’s accident—signs of sagging that would indicate the need for additional repairs. Therefore, we conclude that the plaintiff generated a jury question on whether the defect in the ceiling would have been discoverable upon inspection.</p>
<p id="65d6c6ed-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think material issues of disputed fact exist as to whether reasonable care warranted an inspection of the plaster ceiling and whether such an inspection would have alerted the defendants to the dangerous condition of the ceiling. Therefore, the district court erred in ruling that the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>

<p id="65d6c6f4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question in this slip-and-fall case is what quantum of circumstantial evidence is legally sufficient to support a finding that an unreasonably dangerous condition has existed long enough to charge a proprietor with constructive notice of the condition. The court of appeals held that there was legally <span title="417" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-417">p. 417</span>sufficient evidence that some macaroni salad had existed on the Wal-Mart floor long enough to charge Wal-Mart with constructive notice of the condition. We hold that when circumstantial evidence is relied upon to prove constructive notice, the evidence must establish that it is more likely than not that the dangerous condition existed long enough to give the proprietor a reasonable opportunity to discover the condition. Because we conclude that the circumstantial evidence in this case supports only the <i>possibility</i> that the dangerous condition existed long enough to give Wal-Mart a reasonable opportunity to discover it, we reverse and render judgment for Wal-Mart.</p>
<p id="65d6c6f5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Flora Gonzalez visited the Rio Grande City Wal-Mart with her daughter and two granddaughters. While walking in a busy aisle from the cafeteria toward a store refrigerator, Gonzalez stepped on some cooked macaroni salad that came from the Wal-Mart cafeteria. Gonzalez slipped and fell, sustaining painful injuries to her back, shoulder, and knee. Gonzalez sued Wal-Mart for negligence. A jury awarded her $100,000 and the trial court rendered judgment on the verdict. The court of appeals, with one justice dissenting, reduced Gonzalez’s damages to $96,700 and affirmed the judgment as modified.</p>
<p id="65d6c6f6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Gonzalez was Wal-Mart’s invitee.

<p id="65d6ee0c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The central issue in this case is whether Wal-Mart had constructive knowledge of the spilled macaroni. Wal-Mart argues that the evidence is legally insufficient to show that the macaroni had been on the floor long enough to charge Wal-Mart with constructive notice. When reviewing a legal sufficiency point, this court “must consider only the evidence and inferences tending to support the trial court’s finding, disregarding all contrary evidence and inferences.” <i>Continental Coffee Prods. Co. v. Cazarez</i>, 937 S.W.2d 444, 450 (Tex. 1996). However, meager circumstantial evidence from which equally plausible but opposite inferences may be drawn is speculative and thus legally insufficient to support a finding. <i>See Hammerly Oaks, Inc. v.

However, as evidence that the macaroni had been on the floor for a prolonged period of time, Gonzalez testified that the macaroni had mayonnaise in it, was “fresh,” “wet,” “still humid,” and contaminated with “a lot of dirt.” Gonzalez’s daughter testified that the macaroni had footprints and cart track marks in it and “seemed like it had been there a while.” The court of appeals held this evidence legally sufficient to support the verdict, apparently calling for a relaxed burden of proof in slip-and-fall cases when the evidence is scant:</p>

<p id="65d6ee0e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A plaintiff has the obligation to produce the evidence that exists. If a court requires more than is possible to prove, the court has taken over the legislative function of simply deciding that there will be no negligence cause of action for slip and falls. No court has done this, and the cause of action exists. The great majority of slip-and-fall cases are lost at the trial level and, no doubt, always will be. But this court is not willing to say that an injured person must go beyond the evidence that is created by the operative facts, which would be an impossibility. Of course, there may be cases where there is simply not enough evidence to make a case, even if it is all produced. This is not such a case though.</p></div>
<p id="65d6ee0f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">However, “the fact that proof of causation is difficult does not provide a plaintiff with an excuse to avoid introducing some evidence of causation.” <i>Schaefer v. Texas Employers’ Ins. Ass’n</i>, 612 S.W.2d 199, 205 (Tex. 1980). As the dissent in the court of appeals explained, “the harsh reality is that if the plaintiff cannot prove facts to support her cause of action, there is simply no recovery. This is true not only in slip and fall cases, but in all cases.”</p>
<p id="65d71520-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dirt in macaroni salad lying on a heavily-traveled aisle is no evidence of the length of time the macaroni had been on the floor. That evidence can no more support the inference that it accumulated dirt over a long period of time than it can support the opposite inference that the macaroni had just been dropped on the floor and was quickly contaminated by customers and carts traversing the aisle. In <i>Furr’s Supermarkets, Inc. v. Arellano</i>, 492 S.W.2d 727 (Tex. Civ. App.—El Paso 1973, writ ref’d n.r.e.), another spilled-macaroni case, the court held that testimony that the dried macaroni noodles that caused the plaintiff’s fall were “soiled, scattered and appeared as though other persons had passed through the area and had been run over presumably by another cart or carts” was no evidence of the length of time the macaroni noodles had been there. <i>Id.</i> at 728; <i>see also H.E. Butt Grocery Co. v. Rodriguez</i>, 441 S.W.2d 215, 217 (Tex. Civ. App.—Corpus Christi 1969, no writ) (holding that testimony that the grape on which plaintiff slipped was squashed and muddy, that the floor was dirty, and that pieces of paper were strewn around nearby was no evidence that the grape had been on the floor long enough to charge the store with notice); <i>H.E. Butt Grocery Store v. Hamilton</i>, 632 S.W.2d 189, 191 (Tex.

There were no comparisons between the dirt on the macaroni salad and the dirt on the surrounding floorspace that would justify the inference, relied on in <i>H.E. Butt Grocery Co. v. Heaton</i>, 547 S.W.2d 75, 76 (Tex. Civ. App.—Waco 1977, no writ), that the macaroni salad had been on the floor as long as the surrounding dirt on the floor, or that the dirt on the macaroni salad had dried, suggesting that it had been there for a prolonged period of time.</p>
<p id="65d71521-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The presence of footprints or cart tracks in the macaroni salad equally supports the inference that the tracks were of recent origin as it supports the opposite inference, that the tracks had been there a long time. In <i>Kimbell, Inc. v. Roberson</i>, 570 S.W.2d 587, 590 (Tex. Civ. App.—Tyler 1978, no writ), the court rejected testimony that two or three tracks that had been made through a syrupy or jelly-like substance on which plaintiff slipped tended to show that the substance had been there long enough to charge the store with constructive notice. The court explained, “It is just as likely that the tracks were made by customers traversing the aisle only minutes or even seconds before plaintiff’s fall.” <i>Id.</i> at 590.</p>
<p id="65d71522-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The testimony that the macaroni salad “seemed like it had been there awhile” is mere speculative, subjective opinion of no evidentiary value. The witnesses had not seen the macaroni salad prior to the fall and had no personal knowledge of the length of time it had been on the floor. <i>See Robledo</i>, 597 S.W.2d at 561 (holding that the trial court committed no error in sustaining objection to plaintiff’s testimony that the water “had been there for some time” because the plaintiff had no personal knowledge of how long the puddle had been there).</p>

Gonzalez had to demonstrate that it was <i>more likely than not</i> that the macaroni salad had been there for a long time; Gonzalez proved only that the macaroni salad <i>could possibly</i> have been there long enough to make Wal-Mart responsible for noticing it.</p>

<p id="65d71527-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Constructive Knowledge.</i></b> It should not be surprising that many cases brought by invitees based upon dangerous conditions are premised upon constructive knowledge. This is because if the owner has actual knowledge and <span title="420" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-420">p. 420</span>fails to take any remedial action the breach of duty is fairly obvious. More contentious are the claims where the owner has no actual knowledge, but the claimant alleges that they <i>should</i> have known of the dangerous condition. The court in <i>Commodore</i> mentions two ways to demonstrate constructive knowledge. What are those two ways and why did they both fail in that case?</p>
<p id="65d71528-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "></p><div style="width:488px" class="epub-image-container" id="65d71529-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b"><div class="epub-image "><img alt="A Venn diagram shows two intersecting circles, one labeled “Trespassers” and one labeled “Invitees.” The area of intersection is labeled “Licensees.”" src="./ Chapter 6- Special Duty Rules_files/9781454899273_UWTR_2E_Ch06_fg003.png" style="max-width:488px"></div></div><p></p>
<p id="65d73c3a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Overlapping Duties of Care.</i></b> As the foregoing cases demonstrate, landowners owe a duty of reasonable care toward their invitees with regard to dangerous activities conducted on their land, and with regard to dangerous conditions of which the landowner has actual or constructive knowledge. With regard to licensees, they occupy a middle ground between the general duty of reasonable care owed to invitees and the duty only to avoid recklessness owed toward trespassers. There is a borrowing of the duties in the case of licensees based upon the distinction between activities and dangerous conditions. This is analogous to the general dichotomy in tort law between acts and omissions. Liability for dangerous conditions could essentially be considered a claim that the landowner failed to take action to remedy or warn about such conditions—an omission. As a hybrid of the two other sets of duties, the landowner’s duties toward licensees is mixed. With regard to activities, the landowner must avoid recklessness. With regard to dangerous conditions, the landowner must exercise reasonable care (though only when the owner has actual knowledge of the condition).</p>
<p id="65d73c3b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Slip and Fall Cases.</i></b> There are many slip and fall claims brought by invitees where the issue of constructive knowledge depends upon some showing that the condition existed for an unreasonably long time without being discovered and remediated. If the plaintiff can show the length of time the condition persisted, then the jury might be able to conclude that this time was more than sufficient to permit the landowner to find and fix the issue. When the plaintiff cannot demonstrate the length of time, even approximately, many courts hold that they have failed to meet their burden of proof required to trigger any duty of care. There are many cases involving slip and fall injuries in grocery stores where the issue of constructive knowledge focuses upon the various adjectives used to describe the food products on the floor as a means of <span title="421" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-421">p. 421</span>demonstrating time. This can be a difficult way to trigger the duty of care as the intermediate appellate court in <i>Wal-Mart</i> sympathized. This ruling still illustrates the majority approach to analyzing the trigger of duty when there is no evidence of actual knowledge.</p>

<p id="65d73c44-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff seeks to recover for injuries he sustained when he dived, headfirst, into the shallow end of a swimming pool owned by the defendants and located on their residential property. His complaint alleges that the defendants were negligent in allowing visitors to dive into the shallow end of the pool and in failing to warn of the danger associated with this activity. A judge in the Superior Court allowed the defendants’ motion for summary judgment, reasoning that diving into the shallow end of a swimming pool is an open and obvious danger which was known to the plaintiff, and that the defendants therefore did not owe the plaintiff a duty of care. The plaintiff timely appealed, and we transferred the case here on our own motion. We affirm.</p>
<p id="65d73c45-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The pool in question is an in-ground type, measuring eighteen feet in width by thirty-six feet in length, with both shallow and deep ends. The bottom of the pool is level in the shallow end, for approximately ten feet of the pool’s length, after which it slopes gradually toward the deep end, the sides of which are tapered. When filled to capacity, the pool is four feet deep at its shallowest point and eight feet at its deepest. There are no markers, either in the pool or on its exterior surround, to indicate the pool’s depth at various points along its length or to demarcate the separation of its shallow and deep ends. However, a diving board is affixed to the exterior of the pool at its deep end. The pool’s interior is covered with a vinyl liner and there is no underwater lighting, so that the bottom of the pool is not visible at night.</p>
<p id="65d73c46-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff, who was a friend of the defendants’ granddaughter, had swum in the pool at least once prior to the night of the accident, during daylight hours. He had observed various swimmers dive into the pool’s deep end from the diving board. He also saw swimmers dive into the pool from the shallow end by performing a flat or “racing dive,” i.e., diving headfirst, with arms outstretched over their heads, landing in the water at an angle roughly parallel to the bottom of the pool, gliding just beneath the water’s surface and eventually surfacing in the deep end. The plaintiff himself had previously dived into the pool’s deep end from the diving board two or three times, and had made one dive into the shallow end. Although he did not know the exact dimensions of the pool, the plaintiff was aware of approximately where the shallow part ended. <span title="422" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-422">p. 422</span>Moreover, he was aware of the shallow end’s approximate depth, having observed other swimmers standing in that part of the pool and having subsequently stood next to these people outside the pool.</p>
<p id="65d73c47-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the evening of July 16, 1996, the plaintiff, then twenty-one years of age, was a guest of the defendants’ granddaughter at the defendants’ residence. The defendants were out of town, but their granddaughter had permission to be on the premises and to use the swimming pool. Sometime between 9 and 9:30 P.M. the plaintiff suffered injuries to his neck and back when he dived into the shallow end of the pool. At the time, he was attempting, in racing dive fashion, to clear the ten-foot expanse of the shallow end and surface in the deep end, but he entered the water at too steep an angle and struck his head on the pool bottom, resulting in a fracture of his cervical vertebrae. By his own admission, the plaintiff knew that he could be injured if he were to hit his head on the bottom of the pool when diving, and his purpose in trying to clear the shallow end was to avoid the sort of accident that occurred. The plaintiff’s injury caused immediate paralysis in his lower extremities and required a two-day stay in the hospital, but the paralysis was not permanent.</p>
<p id="65d73c48-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An owner or possessor of land owes a common-law duty of reasonable care to all persons lawfully on the premises. This duty includes an obligation to “maintain[] his property in a reasonably safe condition in view of all the circumstances, including the likelihood of injury to others, the seriousness of the injury, and the burden of avoiding the risk,” <i>Mounsey v. Ellard, 708</i>, 297 N.E.2d 43 (1978), and “to warn visitors of any unreasonable dangers of which the landowner is aware or reasonably should be aware.” <i>Davis v. Westwood Group, supra</i>, and cases cited. However, a landowner is “not obliged to supply a place of maximum safety, but only one which would be safe to a person who exercises such minimum care as the circumstances reasonably indicate.” <i>Lyon v. Morphew</i>, 424 Mass, 678 N.E.2d 1306 (1997). Moreover, it is well established in our law of negligence that a landowner’s duty to protect lawful visitors against dangerous conditions on his property ordinarily does not extend to dangers that would be obvious to persons of average intelligence. <i>See Lyon v. Morphew, supra</i>. Landowners are relieved of the duty to warn of open and obvious dangers on their premises because it is not reasonably foreseeable that a visitor exercising (as the law presumes) reasonable care for his own safety would suffer injury from such blatant hazards. Stated otherwise, where a danger would be obvious to a person of ordinary perception and judgment, a landowner may reasonably assume that a visitor has knowledge of it and, therefore, “any further warning would be an empty form” that would not reduce the likelihood of resulting harm. <i>LeBlanc v. Atlantic Bldg. &amp; Supply Co.</i>, 84 N.E.2d 10 (1949).</p>
<p id="65d73c49-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although we have not previously addressed this precise issue, Massachusetts courts have continued to apply the open and obvious danger rule in cases decided after the Legislature’s abolition of the assumption of risk defense, thereby at least implicitly recognizing the rule’s continuing viability. Assumption of risk, along with contributory negligence, was an affirmative defense to negligence for which the defendant bore the burden of proof at trial. A plaintiff <span title="423" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-423">p. 423</span>assumed the risk of harm when he voluntarily exposed himself to a known danger which had been caused by the defendant’s negligence; the focus of the inquiry was thus on the plaintiff’s own carelessness or negligence in failing to avoid a hazard which he knew about and appreciated. By contrast, the open and obvious danger doctrine arises in connection with the separate issue of a defendant’s duty to protect others from dangerous conditions about which the defendant knows or should know. <i>Callahan v. Boston Edison Co</i>., 24 Mass. App. Ct. 950, 953, 509 N.E.2d 1208 (1987) (“Whether a danger is open and obvious has to do with the duty of the defendant, not the negligence of the plaintiff”). Rather than evaluating a particular plaintiff’s subjective reasonableness or unreasonableness in encountering a known hazard, the inquiry is an objective one that focuses, instead, on the reasonableness of the defendant’s conduct: it presumes a plaintiff’s exercising reasonable care for his own safety and asks whether the dangerous condition was, objectively speaking, so obvious that the defendant would be reasonable in concluding that an ordinarily intelligent plaintiff would perceive and avoid it and, therefore, that any further warning would be superfluous.</p>
<p id="65d7635a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, the superseded common-law defense of assumption of risk goes to a plaintiff’s failure to exercise due care for his own safety, whereas the open and obvious danger rule concerns the existence of a defendant’s duty of care, which the plaintiff must establish as part of his prima facie case before any comparative analysis of fault may be performed.</p>
<p id="65d7635b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The remaining issue concerns whether the judge, in granting summary judgment for the defendants, correctly concluded that the open and obvious danger rule obviated any duty to warn the plaintiff not to dive headfirst into the shallow end of the defendants’ swimming pool. Plain common sense, bolstered by the weight of authority in other jurisdictions where this issue has been addressed, convince us that this conclusion is indisputably correct. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g., Lederman v. Pacific Indus.</i>, 939 F. Supp. 619, 625 (N.D. Ill. 1996), aff’d, 119 F.3d 551 (7th Cir. 1997) (under Illinois law, manufacturer of swimming pool under no duty to warn adult of danger of quadriplegia posed by diving into water of uncertain depth); <i>Neff v. Coleco Indus., Inc.</i> 760 F. Supp. 864, 868 (D. Kan. 1991), aff’d, 961 F.2d 220 (10th Cir. 1992) (manufacturer had no duty to warn of open and obvious risk of diving headfirst into shallow swimming pool).</p>
<p id="65d7635c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the plaintiff argues that, in concluding that the danger was open and obvious, the judge improperly considered subjective factors particular to this plaintiff, thus revealing that, under the guise of performing an objective inquiry about the defendant’s duty, he was in reality performing an assumption of risk analysis. Admittedly, certain of the factors relied on by the judge—such as the plaintiff’s prior experience and ostensible skill as a swimmer, and his awareness that serious injury could result if he were to strike his head on the bottom of the defendants’ swimming pool while diving—bear on this particular plaintiff’s subjective state of mind and actual knowledge of the danger of engaging in this activity, and thus should have been excluded from an objective inquiry concerning whether the risk of injury was obvious to a hypothetical “person <span title="424" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-424">p. 424</span>of average intelligence.” However, even when such subjective factors are excluded from the analysis, sufficient undisputed evidence remains to support the judge’s conclusion.</p>
<p id="65d7635d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It would be obvious to a person of average intelligence that a swimming pool must have a bottom. We have no doubt that an ordinarily intelligent adult in our society would be aware that the bottom of a swimming pool is a hard surface, liable to cause injury if one were to strike it with one’s head. Moreover, the design and layout of the defendants’ pool would have indicated to a person of average intelligence that the end into which the plaintiff dived was not intended for this activity: the diving board was affixed to the opposite end of the pool, making it apparent that the pool’s deepest water was located at that end and that diving was intended to take place there. Finally, the plaintiff attempted his dive late in the evening, when there was little if any natural light, and the defendants’ pool had no underwater lighting, such that its bottom was not visible to someone standing outside the water. The water into which the plaintiff dived, then, was of uncertain depth. A person of average intelligence would clearly have recognized that diving head first into shallow water in these circumstances posed a risk of suffering injury by striking the bottom of the pool.</p>
<p id="65d7635e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that, because the danger of diving into the shallow end of a swimming pool is open and obvious to a person of average intelligence, the defendants had no duty to warn the plaintiff of this danger as a matter of law and, therefore, they could not be found liable for his injuries. The defendants’ motion for summary judgment was correctly allowed.</p>

<p id="65d76361-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Contributory Negligence vs. Open and Obvious Exception.</i></b> The <i>open and obvious</i> doctrine utilized by the court takes an instance where the danger is so greatly foreseeable, that no duty is deemed necessary. In many instances where the open and obvious danger doctrine applies it would also be possible to assert contributory negligence against the plaintiff. Another possible defense, covered in Chapter 7, is secondary implied assumption of risk—that the plaintiff was aware of the danger and voluntarily encountered it anyway. As the court indicated, many courts have abolished the secondary implied assumption of the risk affirmative defense and contributory negligence is no longer fatal to the plaintiff’s claim in many states. Beyond these pragmatic differences, why else would the doctrine applied by the court be better for a defendant than asserting some other affirmative defense?</p>
<p id="65d76362-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Objective vs. Subjective Inquiry.</i></b> The analysis of whether a danger is open and obvious is objective: Would the reasonable person under the circumstances have noticed the danger? In defense of the trial court’s analysis, the appellate court suggests that it was improper to consider any specialized <span title="425" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-425">p. 425</span>knowledge or experience of the plaintiff. But if the plaintiff were considered the actor in question, why wouldn’t it be appropriate to consider any elevated knowledge, gifts, or experience in utilizing the objective inquiry? Recall <i>Cervelli v. Graves</i> in Chapter 4 (actor’s elevated knowledge and driving skills should be considered in applying the reasonable person, objective test).</p>
<p id="65d76363-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>The Natural Accumulation Rule.</i></b> Some states are not willing to recognize the open and obvious danger rule because it can apply to both natural and man-made hazards. In such states they instead only apply a related doctrine—the <i>natural accumulation</i> rule. Under this rule, when natural hazards (rain, snow, wind, etc.) are obvious to a reasonable person, the defendant has no duty to eliminate the condition or warn the plaintiff about it. It works exactly like the open and obvious danger rule but is only applicable to weather-related phenomena. <i>See e.g.</i>, Klopp v. The Wackenhut Corp., 824 P.2d 292 (N. Mex. 1992).</p>

<p id="65d76367-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">We saw at the beginning of this chapter, in <i>Lundy</i>, that when an invitee is in peril on the land of the defendant, that the defendant’s relationship with the invitee requires it to come to their aid. In other words, actual knowledge of peril demands some reasonable action. Courts have reaffirmed this principle when the invitee is attacked by someone on the defendant’s land and the defendant witnesses the attack. In one case, the landowner failed to even pick up a phone and dial 911 despite watching an invitee getting battered in a brawl. Gould v. Taco Bell, 722 P.2d 511 (Kan. 1986). The tougher issue is when should the landowner have to anticipate a possible criminal attack on its invitees and exercise reasonable care in arranging for security? The following case wrestles with this issue and discusses a variety of differing approaches taken by various states.</p>

<p id="65d7897e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The present case asks us to determine whether the trial court, in a negligence action, properly denied a motion for summary judgment on the issue of duty. After being sexually assaulted in a fraternity house where she had attended a party, Tracey Johnson (“Johnson”) brought a civil claim against the perpetrator, Joseph Motz (“Motz”); Delta Tau Delta, Beta Alpha Chapter (“DTD”), the fraternity at which the party and sexual assault occurred; and Delta Tau Delta, National Fraternity (“National”). Johnson claims that DTD breached a duty of <span title="426" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-426">p. 426</span>care owed to her. DTD filed motions for summary judgment on the grounds that [it did not owe] Johnson a duty of care…[and the] motions were denied. On interlocutory appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed [this denial] of summary judgment on all issues. We…now address whether DTD owed Johnson a common law duty of reasonable care. [We reverse and remand on this issue.]</p>
<p id="65d7897f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">DTD is a fraternity on the campus of Indiana University at Bloomington; it is the local chapter of Delta Tau Delta, National Fraternity. On the evening of October 13, 1990, Johnson, an undergraduate student at Indiana University, attended a party at DTD’s house. Johnson had been invited to the party by a member of DTD. She arrived at the party around 10:00 p.m. with some friends who had also been invited. At the party, beer was served in a downstairs courtyard area of the house. Pledges drew beer from a keg into pitchers, which they then poured into cups to serve to guests. The courtyard was very crowded and rather chaotic. Around midnight, Johnson and her friends were about to leave when she encountered Motz, an alumnus of the fraternity and an acquaintance of hers.</p>
<p id="65d78980-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Motz had driven into Bloomington that day. After going to a football game, Motz bought a case of beer which he brought back to the chapter house. He stored his beer in room C17. Prior to meeting Johnson, Motz drank four or five of his beers.</p>
<p id="65d78981-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While Johnson and Motz were talking, Johnson’s friends wandered off and she was unable to find them. Motz offered to drive her home, but only after he had sobered up. Johnson accepted the offer. They waited together in room C17 where they both had some drinks of hard liquor, talked, and listened to music with other guests.</p>
<p id="65d78982-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Between 3:30 a.m. and 4:00 a.m., Johnson again searched for a ride home. When she was unsuccessful, Motz reaffirmed his offer to drive her home, but only after he sobered up. Soon thereafter, Motz locked himself and Johnson in the room. He then sexually assaulted Johnson.</p>
<p id="65d78983-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The…issue in this appeal is whether the trial court was correct to deny DTD’s motion for summary judgment on Johnson’s negligence claim. In this case, Johnson argues that DTD owed its guests a duty of reasonable care, for example, by providing reasonable protection, security, and supervision at the party, that DTD breached its duty, and that the breach proximately caused her injuries. DTD moved for summary judgment on the issue of duty, arguing that it owed no duty to protect Johnson from the unforeseeable criminal acts of a third party. Determining whether one party owes a duty to another is a question of law for the court. As such, we will determine, de novo, whether DTD owed a duty to Johnson and, thus, whether the trial court correctly denied DTD’s motion for summary judgment.</p>
<p id="65d78984-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[A member of DTD invited Johnson to the party and the assault occurred in DTD’s house.] In Burrell v. Meads, this Court held that a social guest who has been invited by a landowner onto the landowner’s land is to be treated as an invitee. 569 N.E.2d 637, 643 (Ind. 1991). Thus, a social host owes his guests the duty to exercise reasonable care for their protection. The issue in this case is whether a landowner may have a duty to take reasonable care to protect an <span title="427" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-427">p. 427</span>invitee from the criminal acts of a third party. This issue is one that we have not addressed recently and one which has resulted in some disagreement in the Court of Appeals.</p>
<p id="65d78985-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question of whether and to what extent landowners owe any duty to protect their invitees from the criminal acts of third parties has been the subject of substantial debate among the courts and legal scholars in the past decade. <i>See, e.g., McClung v. Delta Square Ltd. Partnership</i>, 937 S.W.2d 891, 897 (Tenn. 1996) (noting that the debate caused the court to reconsider its law in this area). The majority of courts that have addressed this issue agree that, while landowners are not to be made the insurers of their invitees’ safety, landowners do have a duty to take reasonable precautions to protect their invitees from foreseeable criminal attacks. Indiana courts have not held otherwise.</p>
<p id="65d78986-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A further question arises, however, in that courts employ different approaches to determine whether a criminal act was foreseeable such that a landowner owed a duty to take reasonable care to protect an invitee from the criminal act. There are four basic approaches that courts use to determine foreseeability in this context: (1) the specific harm test, (2) the prior similar incidents test, (3) the totality of the circumstances test, and (4) the balancing test. <i>See generally, Krier v. Safeway Stores 46, Inc</i>., 943 P.2d 405 (Wyo. 1997); <i>McClung</i>, 937 S.W.2d at 899-901; <i>Boren v. Worthen Nat’l Bank</i>, 921 S.W.2d 934, 940-41 (Ark. 1996); <i>Ann M. v. Pacific Plaza Shopping Ctr.</i>, 6 Cal. 4th 666, 863 P.2d 207, 215-16 (Cal. 1993); Michael J. Yelnosky, Comment, <i>Business Inviters’ Duty to Protect Invitees from Criminal Acts</i>, 134 U. Pa. l. Rev. 883, 891-900 (1986).</p>
<p id="65d78987-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the specific harm test, a landowner owes no duty unless the owner knew or should have known that the specific harm was occurring or was about to occur. <i>See McClung</i>, 937 S.W.2d at 895; <i>Boren</i>, 921 S.W.2d at 940. Most courts are unwilling to hold that a criminal act is foreseeable only in these situations. <i>See McClung</i>, 937 S.W.2d at 899 (abrogating <i>Cornpropst v. Sloan</i>, 528 S.W.2d 188, 198 (Tenn. 1975) which had employed this test); <i>Boren</i>, 921 S.W.2d at 940.</p>
<p id="65d78988-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the prior similar incidents (PSI) test, a landowner may owe a duty of reasonable care if evidence of prior similar incidents of crime on or near the landowner’s property shows that the crime in question was foreseeable. Although courts differ in the application of this rule, all agree that the important factors to consider are the number of prior incidents, their proximity in time and location to the present crime, and the similarity of the crimes. <i>See McClung</i>, 937 S.W.2d at 899; <i>Boren</i>, 921 S.W.2d at 941. Courts differ in terms of how proximate and similar the prior crimes are required to be as compared to the current crime. Compare <i>Baptist Mem’l Hosp. v. Gosa</i>, 686 So. 2d 1147 (Ala. 1996) (employing a strict PSI test; holding that, although there were 57 crimes reported over a five year period, only six involved a physical touching and, therefore, the assault of someone with a gun was unforeseeable) with <i>Sturbridge Partners, Ltd. v. Walker</i>, 482 S.E.2d 339 (Ga. 1997) (employing a liberal PSI test; holding that two prior burglaries of apartments was sufficient to make a rape in an apartment foreseeable). While this approach establishes a relatively clear line when landowner liability will attach, many courts have rejected this test for public <span title="428" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-428">p. 428</span>policy reasons. <i>See Isaacs v. Huntington Mem’l Hosp.</i>, 695 P.2d 653, 658-59 (Cal. 1985), modified by <i>Ann M. v. Pacific Plaza Shopping Ctr</i>., 863 P.2d 207 (Cal. 1993); <i>Maguire v. Hilton Hotels Corp.</i>, 899 P.2d 393, 400 (Haw. 1995); <i>Sharp v. W.H. Moore Inc.</i>, 796 P.2d 506, 510-11 (Idaho 1990); <i>Seibert v. Vic Regnier Builders, Inc</i>., 856 P.2d 1332, 1339 (Kan. 1993); <i>Gans v. Parkview Plaza Partnership</i>, 571 N.W.2d 261, 268 (Neb. 1997); <i>Doud v. Las Vegas Hilton Corp</i>., 864 P.2d 796, 800 (Nev. 1993); <i>Clohesy v. Food Circus Supermarkets, Inc.</i>, 694 A.2d 1017, 1023 (N.J. 1997); <i>Small v. McKennan</i>, 403 N.W.2d 410, 413 (S.D. 1987), aff’d, 437 N.W.2d 194, 201 (S.D. 1989). The public policy considerations are that under the PSI test the first victim in all instances is not entitled to recover, landowners have no incentive to implement even nominal security measures, the test incorrectly focuses on the specific crime and not the general risk of foreseeable harm, and the lack of prior similar incidents relieves a defendant of liability when the criminal act was, in fact, foreseeable.</p>
<p id="65d78989-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the totality of the circumstances test, a court considers all of the circumstances surrounding an event, including the nature, condition, and location of the land, as well as prior similar incidents, to determine whether a criminal act was foreseeable. <i>See Isaacs</i>, 695 P.2d at 659-61; <i>Maguire</i>, 899 P.2d at 399; <i>Seibert</i>, 856 P.2d at 1339; <i>Whittaker v. Saraceno</i>, 418 Mass. 196, 635 N.E.2d 1185, 1188 (Mass. 1994); <i>Gans</i>, 571 N.W.2d at 268-69; <i>Doud</i>, 864 P.2d at 800; <i>Clohesy</i>, 694 A.2d at 1023; <i>Small v. McKennan</i>, 437 N.W.2d 194, 200-01 (S.D. 1989). Courts that employ this test usually do so out of dissatisfaction with the limitations of the prior similar incidents test. The most frequently cited limitation of this test is that it tends to make the foreseeability question too broad and unpredictable, effectively requiring that landowners anticipate crime. <i>See McClung</i>, 937 S.W.2d at 900 (adopting the balancing test); <i>Ann M.</i>, 863 P.2d at 214-15 (reconsidering and rejecting the totality of the circumstances test in favor of the balancing test).</p>
<p id="65d7898a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the final approach, the balancing test, a court balances “the degree of foreseeability of harm against the burden of the duty to be imposed.” <i>McClung</i>, 937 S.W.2d at 901; <i>see Ann M.</i>, 863 P.2d at 215. In other words, as the foreseeability and degree of potential harm increase, so, too, does the duty to prevent against it. This test still relies largely on prior similar incidents in order to ensure that an undue burden is not placed upon landowners.</p>
<p id="65d7b09b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree with those courts that decline to employ the specific harm test and prior similar incidents test. We find that the specific harm test is too limited in its determination of when a criminal act is foreseeable. While the prior similar incidents test has certain appeal, we find that this test has the potential to unfairly relieve landowners of liability in some circumstances when the criminal act was reasonably foreseeable.</p>
<p id="65d7b09c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As between the totality of the circumstances and balancing tests, we find that the totality of the circumstances test is the more appropriate. The balancing test seems to require that the court ask whether the precautions which plaintiff asserts should have been taken were unreasonably withheld given <span title="429" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-429">p. 429</span>the foreseeability of the criminal attack. In other words, the question is whether defendant took reasonable precautions given the circumstances. We believe that this is basically a breach of duty evaluation and is best left for the jury to decide.</p>
<p id="65d7b09d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, the totality of the circumstances test permits courts to consider all of the circumstances to determine duty. In our view and the view of other state supreme courts, the totality of the circumstances test does not impose on landowners the duty to ensure an invitee’s safety, but requires landowners to take <i>reasonable</i> precautions to prevent <i>foreseeable</i> criminal acts against invitees. A substantial factor in the determination of duty is the number, nature, and location of prior similar incidents, but the lack of prior similar incidents will not preclude a claim where the landowner knew or should have known that the criminal act was foreseeable. The advantage of the totality of the circumstances approach is that it incorporates the specific harm and prior similar incidents tests as factors to consider when determining whether the landowner owed a duty to an injured invitee without artificially and arbitrarily limiting the inquiry. Therefore, we now explicitly state that Indiana courts confronted with the issue of whether a landowner owes a duty to take reasonable care to protect an invitee from the criminal acts of a third party should apply the totality of the circumstances test to determine whether the crime in question was foreseeable.</p>
<p id="65d7b09e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying the totality of the circumstances test to the facts of this case, we hold that DTD owed Johnson a duty of reasonable care. Within two years of this case, two specific incidents occurred which warrant consideration. First, in March 1988, a student was assaulted by a fraternity member during an alcohol party at DTD. Second, in April 1989 at DTD, a blindfolded female was made, against her will, to drink alcohol until she was sick and was pulled up out of the chair and spanked when she refused to drink. In addition, the month before this sexual assault occurred, DTD was provided with information from National concerning rape and sexual assault on college campuses. Amongst other information, DTD was made aware that “1 in 4 college women have either been raped or suffered attempted rape,” that “75% of male students and 55% of female students involved in date rape had been drinking or using drugs,” that “the group most likely to commit gang rape on the college campus was the fraternity,” and that fraternities at seven universities had “recently experienced legal action taken against them for rape and/or sexual assault.” We believe that to hold that a sexual assault in this situation was not foreseeable, as a matter of law, would ignore the facts and allow DTD to flaunt the warning signs at the risk of all of its guests.</p>
<p id="65d7b09f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a landowner under these facts, DTD owed Johnson a duty to take reasonable care to protect her from a foreseeable sexual assault. It is now for the jury to decide whether DTD breached this duty, and, if so, whether the breach proximately caused Johnson’s injury. While this may be the exceptional case wherein a landowner in a social host situation is held to have a duty to take reasonable care to protect an invitee from the criminal acts of another, when <span title="430" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-430">p. 430</span>the landowner is in a position to take reasonable precautions to protect his guest from a foreseeable criminal act, courts should not hesitate to hold that a duty exists.</p>

<p id="65d7b0a2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Social Guest as Invitee.</i></b> You will observe that Indiana recently made the decision to treat social guests as invitees rather than licensees. While social guests have not traditionally been afforded this status, some states have been uncomfortable with giving the social guest less protection than the random member of the public who is considered an invitee on the premises of a business. Some states have simply merged licensees and invitees and afforded them both a duty of reasonable care. The <i>Freeland</i> case in the next unit discusses such reform.</p>
<p id="65d7b0a3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Differing Tests for Foreseeable Harm from Crime.</i></b> All courts will demand a duty of reasonable care when the premises owner witnesses an invitee being attacked; that is, when there is actual knowledge of the peril. What specifically is required of the landowner depends on the jury’s view of the circumstances. But simply to stand by and attempt nothing almost certainly will constitute a breach. If you think of the duty to invitees for dangerous conditions, you might consider this circumstance one where the owner has actual knowledge of the danger. The foregoing case deals with how to tag a landowner with constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition (i.e. the relatively high potential for crime). The two most widely used tests—the <i>prior similar instances</i> test and the <i>totality of the circumstances</i> test—are different ways to ascertain just how foreseeable the potential for crime is on the land. Where it is foreseeable enough—for example, where there is greater foreseeability of crime than in other surrounding areas—courts say that this triggers a duty to take some reasonable actions to provide protection to the invitee or to deter such crime. In the foregoing case, what steps might DTD have undertaken in light of the foreseeability of date rape to protect its guests during alcohol parties?</p>
<p id="65d7b0a4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Other Examples of This Duty.</i></b> The foregoing case is somewhat unusual. More typical examples, where the issue of the duty to protect from or prevent criminal attack on invitees arises, involve armed robberies, fighting, or theft in shopping malls, in parking lots of retail stores, or in taverns. As between the various tests, which one would appear to be best for the landowner? Why? Considering the facts from <i>Delta Tau Delta</i>, under which tests would you conclude that a duty of care should exist? You may recall the <i>McCarty</i> case in Chapter 4 where we first confronted the Learned Hand Formula for determining reasonable conduct. The court in that opinion did not address the issue of whether the resort owed the plaintiff a duty to anticipate and prevent the <span title="431" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-431">p. 431</span>criminal attack.

<p id="65d7d7be-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The sole issue arising out of the case <i>sub judice</i> is whether defendant Dean Freeland’s (“Freeland”) act of leaving a stick on his porch constituted negligence. Indeed, this case presents us with the simplest of factual scenarios–Freeland requested that plaintiff John Harvey Nelson (“Nelson”) pick him up at his house for a business meeting the two were attending, and Nelson, while doing so, tripped over a stick that Freeland had inadvertently left lying on his porch. Nelson brought this action against Freeland and his wife seeking damages for the injuries he sustained in the fall. The trial court granted summary judgment for the defendants, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>
<p id="65d7d7bf-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the most basic principles of tort law should provide an easy answer to this case, our current premises liability trichotomy—that is, the invitee, licensee, and trespasser classifications—provides no clear solution and has created dissension and confusion amongst the attorneys and judges involved. Thus, once again, this Court confronts the problem of clarifying our enigmatic premises-liability scheme–a problem that we have addressed over fourteen times.</p>
<p id="65d7d7c0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[W]e have repeatedly waded through the mire of North Carolina premises-liability law. Nonetheless, despite our numerous attempts to clarify this liability scheme and transform it into a system capable of guiding North Carolina landowners toward appropriate conduct, this case and its similarly situated predecessors convincingly demonstrate that our current premises-liability scheme has failed to establish a stable and predictable system of laws. Significantly, despite over one hundred years of utilizing the common-law trichotomy, we still are unable to determine unquestionably whether a man who trips over a stick at a <span title="432" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-432">p. 432</span>friend/business partner’s house is entitled to a jury trial—a question ostensibly answerable by the most basic tenet and duty under tort law: the reasonable-person standard of care.</p>
<p id="65d7d7c1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given that our current premises-liability scheme has confounded our judiciary, we can only assume that it has inadequately apprised landowners of their respective duties of care. Thus, it befalls us to examine the continuing utility of the common-law trichotomy as a means of determining landowner liability in North Carolina. In analyzing this question, we will consider the effectiveness of our current scheme of premises-liability law, the nationwide trend of abandoning the common-law trichotomy in favor of a reasonable-care standard, and the policy reasons for and against abandoning the trichotomy in this state.</p>
<p id="65d7d7c2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under current North Carolina law, the standard of care a landowner owes to persons entering upon his land depends upon the entrant’s status, that is, whether the entrant is a licensee, invitee, or trespasser. An invitee is one who goes onto another’s premises in response to an express or implied invitation and does so for the mutual benefit of both the owner and himself. The classic example of an invitee is a store customer. <i>See, e.g., Rives v. Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co.</i>, 68 N.C. App. 594, 315 S.E.2d 724 (1984). A licensee, on the other hand, “is one who enters onto another’s premises with the possessor’s permission, express or implied, solely for his own purposes rather than the possessor’s benefit.” <i>Mazzacco</i>, 303 N.C. at 497, 279 S.E.2d at 586-87. The classic example of a licensee is a social guest. <i>See, e.g., Crane v. Caldwell</i>, 113 N.C. App. 362, 366, 438 S.E.2d 449, 452 (1994). Lastly, a trespasser is one who enters another’s premises without permission or other right. <i>See Newton</i>, 342 N.C. at 559, 467 S.E.2d at 63.</p>
<p id="65d7d7c3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a traditional common-law premises-liability action, the threshold issue of determining the plaintiff’s status at the time of the injury is of substantial import. The gravity of this determination stems from the fact that there is a descending degree of duty owed by a landowner based upon the plaintiff’s status.</p>
<p id="65d7d7c4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the common-law trichotomy has been entrenched in this country’s tort-liability jurisprudence since our nation’s inception, over the past fifty years, many states have questioned, modified, and even abolished it after analyzing its utility in modern times. At first, states believed that although the policies underlying the trichotomy—specifically those involving the supremacy of land ownership rights—were no longer viable, they nonetheless could find means to salvage it. In particular, states attempted to salvage the trichotomy by engrafting into it certain exceptions and subclassifications which would allow it to better congeal with our present-day policy of balancing land-ownership rights with the right of entrants to receive adequate protection from harm. Accordingly, North Carolina, along with the rest of the country, witnessed the burgeoning of novel jurisprudence involving entrant-protection theories such as the active-negligence…doctrine. Unfortunately, these exceptions and subclassifications ultimately forced courts to maneuver their way through a dizzying array of factual nuances and delineations. <i>See Kermarec</i>, 358 U.S. at 631, 3 L. <span title="433" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-433">p. 433</span>Ed. 2d at 555 (stating “the classification and subclassification bred by the common law have produced confusion and conflict”).</p>
<p id="65d7d7c5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Additionally, courts were often confronted with situations where none of the exceptions or subclassifications applied, yet if they utilized the basic trichotomy, unjust and unfair results would emerge. Therefore, these courts were forced to define terms such as “invitee”…in a broad or strained manner to avoid leaving an injured plaintiff deserving of compensation without redress. Although these broad or strained definitions may have led to just and fair results, they often involved rationales teetering on the edge of absurdity.</p>
<p id="65d7d7c6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[An] example of a broad or strained reading can be found in this Court’s holding in <i>Walker v. Randolph County</i>, 251 N.C. 805, 112 S.E.2d 551 (1960). In <i>Walker</i>, we held that a seventy-seven-year-old woman who went to the county courthouse to look at a notice of sale of realty was an invitee when she fell down the courthouse stairway. This case involved a strained reading of the term “invitee” given that we have always defined that term to include only those individuals who enter another’s premises for the mutual benefit of the landowner and himself. That is, we were willing to implicitly conclude that the county somehow benefitted from posting notices it was statutorily required to post in order to classify the plaintiff as an invitee and hence provide compensation. Thus, <i>…Walker</i> demonstrate[s] how courts have made strained readings of the trichotomy classifications to reach just and fair results.</p>
<p id="65d7d7c7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first significant move toward abolishing the common-law trichotomy occurred in 1957 when England—the jurisdiction giving rise to the trichotomy—passed the Occupier’s Liability Act which abolished the distinction between invitees, licensees and so-called contractual visitors. Shortly thereafter, the United States Supreme Court decided not to apply the trichotomy to admiralty law after concluding that it would be inappropriate to hold that a visitor is entitled to a different or lower standard of care simply because he is classified as a “licensee.” <i>See Kermarec</i>, 358 U.S. at 630, 3 L. Ed. 2d at 554. In so ruling, the Court noted that “the distinctions which the common law draws between licensee and invitee were inherited from a culture deeply rooted to the land, a culture which traced many of its standards to a heritage of feudalism.” <i>Id.</i> Ultimately, the Court concluded that the numerous exceptions and subclassifications engrafted into the trichotomy have obscured the law, thereby causing it to move unevenly and with hesitation toward “‘imposing on owners and occupiers a single duty of reasonable care in all the circumstances.’” <i>Id.</i> at 631.</p>
<p id="65d7d7c8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nine years later, the Supreme Court of California decided the seminal case of <i>Rowland v. Christian</i>, 443 P.2d 561 which abolished the common-law trichotomy in California in favor of modern negligence principles. Specifically, the court in <i>Rowland</i> held that the proper question to be asked in premises-liability actions is whether “in the management of his property [the landowner] has acted as a reasonable man in view of the probability of injury to others.” <i>Id.</i> at 568. Moreover, the court followed both England’s and the United States Supreme Court’s lead by noting that “whatever may have been the historical <span title="434" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-434">p. 434</span>justifications for the common law distinctions, it is clear that those distinctions are not justified in the light of our modern society.” <i>Id</i>. at 567. The court continued by stating that the trichotomy was “contrary to our modern social mores and humanitarian values…[, and it] obscures rather than illuminates the proper considerations which should govern determination of the question of duty.” <i>Id.</i> at 568.</p>
<p id="65d7d7c9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Rowland</i> decision ultimately served as a catalyst for similar judicial decisions across the country. Indeed, since <i>Rowland</i>, twenty-five jurisdictions have either modified or abolished their common-law trichotomy scheme—seven within the last five years.</p>
<p id="65d7d7ca-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Specifically, eleven jurisdictions have completely eliminated the common-law distinctions between licensee, invitee, and trespasser.</p>
<p id="65d7fedb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Further, fourteen jurisdictions have repudiated the licensee-invitee distinction while maintaining the limited-duty rule for trespassers.</p>
<p id="65d7fedc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In summation, nearly half of all jurisdictions in this country have judicially abandoned or modified the common-law trichotomy in favor of the modern “reasonable-person” approach that is the norm in all areas of tort law.</p>
<p id="65d7fedd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To assess the advantages and disadvantages of abolishing the common-law trichotomy, we first consider the purposes and policies behind its creation and current use. The common-law trichotomy traces its roots to nineteenth-century England. Indeed, it emanated from an English culture deeply rooted to the land; tied with feudal heritage; and wrought with lords whose land ownership represented power, wealth, and dominance. Even though nineteenth-century courts were aware of the threat that unlimited landowner freedom and its accompanying immunity placed upon the community, they nevertheless refused to provide juries with unbounded authority to determine premises-liability cases. Rather, these courts restricted the jury’s power because juries were comprised mainly of potential land <i>entrants</i> who most likely would act to protect the community at large and thereby reign in the landowner’s sovereign power over his land. Sears, <i>Common Law of Premises Liability</i>, 44 U. Kan. L. Rev. at 176. Thus, the trichotomy was created to disgorge the jury of some of its power by either allowing the judge to take the case from the jury based on legal rulings or by forcing the jury to apply the mechanical rules of the trichotomy instead of considering the pertinent issue of whether the landowner acted reasonably in maintaining his land.</p>
<p id="65d7fede-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the modern trend of premises-liability law in this country has been toward abolishing the trichotomy in favor of a reasonable-person standard, there are some jurisdictions that have refused to modify or abolish it. One of the primary reasons that some jurisdictions have retained the trichotomy is fear of jury abuse—a fear similar to the reason it was created in the first place. Specifically, jurisdictions retaining the trichotomy fear that plaintiff-oriented juries—like feudal juries composed mostly of land entrants—will impose unreasonable burdens upon defendant-landowners. This argument, however, fails to take into account that juries have properly applied negligence principles in all other areas of tort law, and there has been no indication that defendants in <span title="435" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-435">p. 435</span>other areas have had unreasonable burdens placed upon them. Moreover, given that modern jurors are more likely than feudal jurors to be landowners themselves, it is unlikely that they would be willing to place a burden upon a defendant that they would be unwilling to accept upon themselves.</p>
<p id="65d7fedf-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lastly, opponents of abolishing the trichotomy argue that retention of the scheme is necessary to ensure predictability in the law. For example, prior to abolishing its common-law trichotomy, the Kansas Supreme Court declined an invitation to do so because it believed that the replacement of its stable and established system would result in one that is devoid of standards for liability. <i>See Britt v. Allen County Community Jr. College</i>, 230 Kan. 502, 638 P.2d 914 (1982).</p>
<p id="65d7fee0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The complexity and confusion associated with the trichotomy is twofold. First, the trichotomy itself often leads to irrational results not only because the entrant’s status can change on a whim, but also because the nuances which alter an entrant’s status are undefinable. Consider, for example, the following scenario: A real-estate agent trespasses onto another’s land to determine the value of property adjoining that which he is trying to sell; the real-estate agent is discovered by the landowner, and the two men engage in a business conversation with respect to the landowner’s willingness to sell his property; after completing the business conversation, the two men realize that they went to the same college and have a nostalgic conversation about school while the landowner walks with the man for one acre until they get to the edge of the property; lastly, the two men stand on the property’s edge and speak for another ten minutes about school. If the real-estate agent was injured while they were walking off the property, what is his classification? Surely, he is no longer a trespasser, but did his status change from invitee to licensee once the business conversation ended? What if he was hurt while the two men were talking at the property’s edge? Does it matter how long they were talking?</p>
<p id="65d7fee1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court of Wisconsin made a similar argument in <i>Antoniewicz</i> when it asked whether there is any reason why one who invites a guest to a party should have less concern for that individual’s well-being than he has for the safety of an insurance salesman delivering a policy to his home. <i>See Antoniewicz</i>, 70 Wis. 2d at 854, 236 N.W.2d at 10. The court then inquired whether the life or welfare of the guest should be regarded in a more sacred manner. <i>Id.</i> Moreover, it queried whether we realistically can say that reasonable people vary their conduct based upon the status of the entrant. <i>Id.</i></p>
<p id="65d7fee2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The preceding illustrations demonstrate the complexity associated with the trichotomy. Moreover, they demonstrate that the trichotomy often forces the trier of fact to focus upon irrelevant factual gradations instead of the pertinent question of whether the landowner acted reasonably toward the injured entrant. For instance, in the real-estate agent hypothetical posed above, the trier of fact would be focused on determining the agent’s purpose for being on the land at the time of injury instead of addressing the pertinent question of whether the landowner acted as a reasonable person would under the circumstances.</p>
<p id="65d7fee3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Corresponding to this argument is the fact that “in many instances, recovery by an entrant has become largely a matter of chance, dependent upon the <span title="436" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-436">p. 436</span>pigeonhole in which the law has put him, e.g., ‘trespasser,’ ‘licensee,’ or ‘invitee’—each of which has radically different consequences in law.” <i>Peterson</i>, 294 Minn. at 166, 199 N.W.2d at 643. Significantly, this pigeonholing is essentially an attempt to transmute propositions of fact into propositions of law—a transmutation that has only distracted the jury’s vision away from the proper consideration of whether the defendant acted reasonably. For instance, the three experienced Court of Appeals judges who initially decided this case—Judge Smith, Chief Judge Arnold, and Judge Walker—disagreed not only with respect to whether plaintiff was an invitee or a licensee, but also as to whether this case involved a question of law or fact.</p>
<p id="65d7fee4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lastly, we note that the trichotomy has been criticized because its underlying landowner-immunity principles force many courts to reach unfair and unjust results disjunctive to the modern fault-based tenets of tort law. For example, the Kansas Supreme Court noted that “modern times demand a recognition that requiring all to exercise reasonable care for the safety of others is the more humane approach.” <i>Jones</i>, 254 Kan. at 504, 867 P.2d at 307. Likewise, the California Supreme Court noted that using the trichotomy to determine whether a landowner owed the injured plaintiff a duty of care “is contrary to our modern social mores and humanitarian values.” <i>Rowland</i>, 69 Cal. 2d at 118, 443 P.2d at 567, 70 Cal. Rptr. at 104. Indeed, modern thought dictates that “[a] man’s life or limb does not become less worthy of protection by the law nor a loss less worthy of compensation…because he has come upon the land of another without permission or with permission but without a business purpose.” <i>Id.</i></p>

<p id="65d825f7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">The Washington Supreme Court’s decision to retain the traditional trichotomy classifications was multifaceted: “The reasons proffered for continuing the distinctions include that the distinctions have been applied and developed over the years, offering a degree of stability and predictability and that a unitary standard would not lessen the confusion.…Some courts fear a wholesale change will delegate social policy decisions to the jury with minimal guidance from the court. We find these reasons to be compelling. As noted by the Kansas Supreme Court, ‘The traditional classifications were worked out and the exceptions were spelled out with much thought, sweat and even tears.’ We are not ready to abandon them for a standard with no contours.”</p>

</div>
<p id="65d825f9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Significantly, the fact that judges and justices cannot agree as to whether a landowner’s conduct is actionable—as evidenced by dissents in prior cases—evidences that the trichotomy fails to clearly articulate a landowner’s standard of care. This confusion is most disturbing when considered in light of the comparatively simplistic approach set forth in the modern tort principle of negligence and its accompanying standard of reasonable care under the circumstances.</p>
<p id="65d825fa-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, there are numerous advantages associated with abolishing the trichotomy. First, it is based upon principles which no longer apply to today’s modern industrial society. Further, the preceding cases demonstrate that the trichotomy has failed to elucidate the duty a landowner owes to entrants upon his property. Rather, it has caused confusion amongst our citizens and the judiciary—a confusion exaggerated by the <span title="437" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-437">p. 437</span>numerous exceptions and subclassifications engrafted into it. Lastly, the trichotomy is unjust and unfair because it usurps the jury’s function either by allowing the judge to dismiss or decide the case or by forcing the jury to apply mechanical rules instead of focusing upon the pertinent issue of whether the landowner acted reasonably under the circumstances. Thus, we conclude that North Carolina should join the twenty-four other jurisdictions which have modified or abolished the trichotomy in favor of modern negligence principles.</p>
<p id="65d825fb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given the numerous advantages associated with abolishing the trichotomy, this Court concludes that we should eliminate the distinction between licensees and invitees by requiring a standard of reasonable care toward all lawful visitors. Adoption of a true negligence standard eliminates the complex, confusing, and unpredictable state of premises-liability law and replaces it with a rule which focuses the jury’s attention upon the pertinent issue of whether the landowner acted as a reasonable person would under the circumstances.</p>
<p id="65d825fc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In so holding, we note that we do not hold that owners and occupiers of land are now insurers of their premises. Moreover, we do not intend for owners and occupiers of land to undergo unwarranted burdens in maintaining their premises. Rather, we impose upon them only the duty to exercise reasonable care in the maintenance of their premises for the protection of lawful visitors.</p>
<p id="65d825fd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Further, we emphasize that we will retain a separate classification for trespassers. We believe that the status of trespasser still maintains viability in modern society, and more importantly, we believe that abandoning the status of trespasser may place an unfair burden on a landowner who has no reason to expect a trespasser’s presence. Indeed, whereas both invitees and licensees enter another’s land under color of right, a trespasser has no basis for claiming protection beyond refraining from willful injury.</p>
<p id="65d825fe-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given that we are convinced that the common-law trichotomy is no longer viable, we should put it to rest. By so doing, we align North Carolina premises-liability law with all other aspects of tort law by basing liability upon the pillar of modern tort theory: negligence. Moreover, we now join twenty-four other jurisdictions which have carefully examined and analyzed this issue, ultimately determining that the trichotomy is no longer applicable in the modern world.</p>
<p id="65d825ff-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, plaintiff Nelson is entitled to a trial at which the jury shall be instructed under the new rule adopted by this opinion.

With regard <span title="438" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-438">p. 438</span>to the facts in <i>Freeland</i>, the court says the uncertain classification of the plaintiff made it unclear whether the defendant might be liable to the plaintiff. With regard to the dangerous condition (i.e. the left-behind stick on the steps) do you understand why the defendant’s lack of actual knowledge might be critically important if the court found the plaintiff to be a mere licensee? If so, would the defendant have any potential liability? What does the trichotomy advise about whether the landowner must inspect the property for the benefit of a licensee? Is this unpredictable and uncertain? By contrast, under the holding of the court in <i>Freeland</i>, what will be the outcome? Does the unified system adopted by the court answer the question whether a duty to inspect applied?</p>

<p id="65d84d18-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Currently, the largest divide among the various jurisdictions in premises liability cases is whether to accept the traditional trichotomy (where duty depends upon classifying the plaintiff as trespasser, licensee, or invitee), to break down the categories into only two (trespassers and those legally entitled to enter the land), or to simply charge the jury in all premises liability cases with a “reasonable care” instruction and let the jury decide on a case by case basis what this should mean. About half of the states still swear allegiance to the traditional classifications. The circumstances of the plaintiff’s entry will still potentially impact expectations for the landowner in every case; the difference is whether to have the judge declare differing duties based upon the classifications, or to let the jury intuitively take this factor into account as merely one of the “circumstances” for applying the reasonable care standard. Under the traditional system, legal analysis essentially involves two steps: (1) classifying the plaintiff; and (2) analyzing the facts with the applicable duty to see if a breach of duty has occurred.</p>

<p id="65d84d1b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Our final set of special duty rules deals with the situation where the alleged tortfeasors are professionals practicing their craft. In this regard, we have seen in Chapter 4 two relevant sets of rules with respect to understanding the objective, reasonable person standard. In <i>Cervelli</i>, the court stated that an actor’s superior gifts, talents, knowledge, and skills are taken into consideration in judging whether negligence has occurred. This concept hints at the possibility that professionals might be viewed somewhat differently than others in applying negligence standards given their relatively elevated levels of knowledge, experience, and skills. On the other hand, in <i>The T.J. Hooper</i> case Judge Hand indicated that industry customs are not controlling on the issue of whether an actor’s conduct has conformed to the reasonable person standard. Yet does it make sense to allow lay juries to sit in judgment over doctors and lawyers’ complex judgment decisions regarding their practices when those professions may have established their own expectations? A primary issue this section begins with, therefore, is how these concepts apply when the alleged negligence arises in someone’s professional practice. Is a professional’s duty of care higher than someone else’s and, if so, how do the industry custom rules apply to a professional industry? The following two cases show the majority view—one in a medical injury case (<i>Osborn</i>) and the other (<i>Hodges</i>) in a legal malpractice context.</p>

<p id="65d87436-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial in this case has been reported as the first in the nation where a blood bank was found liable in connection with transmission of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) virus by a blood transfusion.</p>
<p id="65d87437-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In February of 1983, at the age of three weeks, Michael Osborn contracted the AIDS virus from a blood transfusion in the course of surgery on his heart at the University of California at San Francisco Medical Center. The blood used in the operation was supplied by the Irwin Memorial Blood Bank. Michael and his parents, Paul and Mary Osborn, sued Irwin and the University for damages on <span title="440" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-440">p. 440</span>various theories…. [The jury returned a 9-3 decision against Irwin, awarding damages of $550,000 to Michael and $200,000 to his parents.] After the jury returned a general verdict for plaintiffs, the court granted Irwin’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the…negligence claims.</p>
<p id="65d87438-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">…</p>
<p id="65d87439-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The most significant issue on appeal is whether Irwin was entitled to judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the issue of negligence. Qualified experts opined for plaintiffs that Irwin’s blood testing and donor screening practices prior to Michael’s surgery were negligent [for failure to perform certain tests on the blood] in light of concerns about AIDS at the time. On matters such as these that are outside common knowledge, expert opinion is ordinarily sufficient to create a prima facie case. Here, however, there was uncontradicted evidence that Irwin was doing as much if not more in the areas of testing and screening than any other blood bank in the country, and there is no question that it followed accepted practices within the profession. We hold that Irwin cannot be found negligent in these circumstances.</p>
<p id="65d89b4a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most of the evidence at trial concerned the actions Irwin took, or allegedly should have taken, to safeguard its blood supply in early 1983 in light of concerns at the time that AIDS might be transmissible by blood. The issue on appeal is whether, in light of that evidence, Irwin was entitled to judgment notwithstanding the verdict on plaintiffs’ claim of negligence.</p>
<p id="65d89b4b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs’ principal theory of negligence is that Irwin should have started anti-HBc surrogate testing for AIDS prior to Michael’s operation</p>
<p id="65d89b4c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The form of their experts’ testimony suggests that plaintiffs assumed their case against Irwin was one of ordinary negligence. Plaintiffs’ experts did not couch their opinions in terms of the standard of care for blood banks in early 1983. They simply said what Irwin “should” have done, or what a “reasonable person” would have done, in light of what was known about AIDS at the time. We ultimately conclude that this distinction is one of substance as well as form, but the threshold question is whether Irwin should be held to a professional standard of care.</p>
<p id="65d89b4d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We note that this appears to be a point of first impression in California. The precedents indicating that blood banks are not subject to strict liability for providing contaminated blood (<i>see Health &amp; Saf. Code, §1606</i> [distribution of blood is a service rather than a sale]) have observed that blood banks may be sued for negligence but have not undertaken to define the standard of care. (<i>See McDonald v. Sacramento Medical Foundation Blood Bank</i>, 62 Cal. App. 3d 866 (1976); <i>Klaus v. Alameda- Contra Costa Medical Assn. Blood Bank, Inc.</i>, 62 Cal. App. 3d 417, 419 (1976). We have determined that Irwin is a “health care provider” within the meaning of MICRA and there is no question that donor screening and blood testing are “professional services” for purposes of MICRA (defining “professional negligence” in pertinent part as “a negligent act or omission to act by a health care provider in the rendering of professional services”).</p>
<span title="441" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-441">p. 441</span>
<p id="65d89b4e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that the adequacy of a blood bank’s actions to prevent the contamination of blood is a question of professional negligence and fulfillment of a professional standard of care. As another court has observed, the “activities of [the blood bank] at issue here—the collection, processing, and testing of blood for transfusion—no doubt require the exercise of professional expertise and professional judgment.” <i>Doe v. American Red Cross Blood Services, S.C. Region</i>, 125 F.R.D. 637, 642 (D.S.C. 1989).</p>
<p id="65d89b4f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This conclusion is consistent with most of the cases in other jurisdictions that have considered negligence claims against blood banks. This conclusion is also consistent with California cases that have applied a professional standard to activities involving special training and skill.</p>
<p id="65d89b50-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs contend that custom and practice are relevant, but not conclusive, on the standard of care. This is the general rule in cases of ordinary negligence. <i>See</i> Kinney &amp; Wilder, <i>Medical Standard Setting in the Current Malpractice Environment: Problems and Possibilities</i> (1989) 22 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 421, 439-40; Keeton, <i>Medical Negligence</i>—<i>The Standard of Care</i> 10 Tex. Tech L. Rev. 351, 354 (1979). The leading case for this rule is <i>The T.J. Hooper</i> (2d Cir. 1932) 60 F.2d 737, 740, where Learned Hand wrote that “in most cases reasonable prudence is in fact common prudence; but strictly it is never its measure; a whole calling may have unduly lagged in the adoption of new and available devices. It never may set its own tests, however persuasive be its usages. Courts must in the end say what is required; there are precautions so imperative that even their universal disregard will not excuse their omission.” There is no question that California follows this rule in ordinary negligence cases.</p>
<p id="65d89b51-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is a case of professional negligence, however, and we must assess the role of custom and practice in that context. The question presented here is whether California law permits an expert to second-guess an entire profession. We have found no definitive precedent on this issue and it is not one that is likely to arise.</p>
<p id="65d89b52-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Custom and practice are not controlling in cases, unlike ours, where a layperson can infer negligence by a professional without any expert testimony. In <i>Leonard v. Watsonville Community Hosp.</i> (1956) 305 P.2d 36, for example, where a clamp was left in the plaintiff’s body after surgery, the lack of an “‘established practice’” of counting clamps did not preclude a finding of negligence: “Defendants seek to avoid liability on the theory that they were required to exercise only that degree of skill employed by other hospitals and nurses in the community. It is a matter of common knowledge, however, that no special skill is required in counting instruments. Although <i>under such circumstances</i> proof of practice or custom is some evidence of what should be done and may assist in the determination of what constitutes due care, it does not conclusively establish the standard of care.” (<i>Id.</i>, at 519 [italics added].)</p>
<p id="65d89b53-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, in cases like ours where experts are needed to show negligence, their testimony sets the standard of care and is said to be “conclusive.” “Ordinarily, where a professional person is accused of negligence in failing to adhere to accepted standards within his profession the accepted standards <span title="442" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-442">p. 442</span>must be established only by qualified expert testimony [citations] unless the standard is a matter of common knowledge. [Citation.] However, when the matter in issue is within the knowledge of experts only and not within common knowledge, expert evidence is conclusive and cannot be disregarded.” <i>Huber, Hunt &amp; Nichols, Inc. v. Moore</i> (1977) 136 Cal. Rptr. 603. Qualified expert opinion will thus generally preclude a directed verdict in a professional negligence case.</p>
<p id="65d8c264-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case, however, is distinguishable…. Here it is undisputed that no blood bank in the country was doing what the plaintiffs’ experts’ standard of care would require of Irwin, and we have an unusual situation where we are called upon to address the significance of a universal practice.</p>
<p id="65d8c265-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While it may be true that “an increasing number of courts are rejecting the customary practice standard in favor of a reasonable care or reasonably prudent doctor standard” (Prosser &amp; Keeton, The Law of Torts (5th ed., 1988 pocket supp.) p. 30, fn. 53 [citing cases outside California]), numerous commentaries have noted that custom generally sets the standard of care. <i>See</i>, e.g., King, <i>In Search of a Standard of Care for the Medical Profession: The “Accepted Practice” Formula</i> (1975) 28 Vand. L. Rev. 1213, 1235, 1245-1246.</p>
<p id="65d8c266-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most commentators have urged that a customary or accepted practice standard is preferable to one that allows for the disregard of professional judgment. Indeed, the more recent commentaries are not concerned with whether customary practices should be the maximum expected of medical practitioners, but rather with whether those practices should continue to set a minimum standard in a time of increasing economic constraints.</p>
<p id="65d8c267-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The basic reason why professionals are usually held only to a standard of custom and practice is that their informed approach to matters outside common knowledge should not be “evaluated by the ad hoc judgments of a lay judge or lay jurors aided by hindsight.” <i>King, supra</i>, 28 Vand. L. Rev. at p. 1249. In the words of a leading authority, “When it can be said that the collective wisdom of the profession is that a particular course of action is the desirable course, then it would seem that the collective wisdom should be followed by the courts.” Keeton, <i>supra</i>, 10 Tex. Tech L. Rev. at pp. 364-365.</p>
<p id="65d8c268-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The “most famous &amp; judicial departure from the usual rule” is <i>Helling v. Carey</i> (1974) 519 P.2d 981. In that case, the Washington Supreme Court held ophthalmologists negligent as a matter of law for failing to administer routine glaucoma tests to a patient under the age of 40, despite expert testimony from both sides that the standards of the profession did not require such testing of patients that age. The court reached this decision by balancing its perception of the seriousness of the disease against the cost of the test.</p>
<p id="65d8c269-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most of the commentary on this case has been unfavorable. A contemporary observer wrote that the <i>Helling</i> court had “unwisely…arrogated to itself medical decisions, superimposing its medical judgment upon the collective experience of the medical profession. Can it really be said that medical judgments of the courts will be ‘right’ more often than those guided by approved medical practices?” <i>King, supra</i>, 28 Vand. L. Rev. at p. 1250; <i>see also</i>, Keeton, <i>supra</i>, 10 Tex. Tech L. Rev. at pp. 367-68. Such concerns may have been <span title="443" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-443">p. 443</span>borne out by subsequent medical research: “It is a telling commentary on the judicial performance in the <i>Helling</i> case that medical research taking all relevant factors into account provides no convincing evidence for the cost-effectiveness of even the customary practice of screening all patients over age 40 for glaucoma. The Washington court, which held on the basis of its own intuition that it was negligence not to screen the plaintiff because she was <i>under</i> 40, is thus left with egg on its face.” Havighurst, <i>Private Reform of Tort- Law Dogma: Market Opportunities and Legal Obstacles</i> (1986) 49 Law &amp; Contemp. Probs. 143, 159, fn. 45.</p>
<p id="65d8c26a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Prevailing sentiments in other jurisdictions, and some prior cases from this state confirm] that professional prudence is defined by actual or accepted practice within a profession, rather than theories about what “should” have been done.</p>
<p id="65d8c26b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It follows that Irwin cannot be found negligent for failing to perform tests that no other blood bank in the nation was using. Judgment notwithstanding the verdict was properly granted to Irwin on the issue of anti-HBc testing because there was no substantial evidence that failure to conduct the tests was not accepted <i>practice</i> for blood banks in January and February of 1983.</p>

Topping and H.C. Carter, now deceased, in prosecuting, on behalf of plaintiff, certain actions on fire insurance policies.</p>
<p id="65d8e982-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On 4 June 1948 plaintiff’s drugstore building located in Belhaven, N.C., together with his lunch counter, fixtures, stock of drugs and sundries therein contained, was destroyed by fire. At the time plaintiff was insured under four policies of fire insurance against loss of, or damage to, said mercantile building and its contents.

<p id="65d937b5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Professional Negligence Analysis.</i></b> According to the <i>Osborn</i> court, professional malpractice claims are typically analyzed under the professional standard, which affords absolute weight to any professional customs. If professionals have recognized certain customs for actions under certain circumstances, these become the standard of care. When this occurs, the jury does not utilize the considerations normally associated with the Learned Hand formula to determine if a breach of duty has occurred. Instead, the jury merely <span title="446" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-446">p. 446</span>applies the applicable custom to the defendant professional’s conduct to see if they met this alternative standard of care. The only exception is when the professional’s action does not involve matters over which a layperson lacks understanding. For example, if a patient in a hospital slips and falls on a wet floor, the hospital’s negligence would not rely upon application of the professional standard. If a surgeon forgets to remove a piece of surgical hardware from the patient (a so-called “sponge” case), the jury need not hear expert testimony about whether a custom exists to remove a scalpel. Or if a lawyer forgets to file a lawsuit and the statute of limitations runs on the claim, even a lay juror can understand easily how this would amount to negligence. But in any area requiring professional expertise and judgment, the custom within the profession governs the analysis.</p>
<p id="65d937b6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Rejection of</i> The T.J. Hooper.</b> The professional standard is a stark departure from what we discovered in Chapter 4 in the case of <i>The T.J. Hooper</i>. The idea from that case of industry custom being relevant but not controlling seemed to make sense. But with respect to professionals, most courts have held that it would be nonsensical to allow jurors to second-guess the views of an entire profession. This conclusion makes the issue of who is considered a professional very important. In the next case we will consider this issue squarely. In the context of that case, you will discover why courts are willing to trust professionals to set their own standard of care when we don’t allow tug boat owners to do likewise. Application of the professional standard of care, despite the perhaps good reason for its use, sometimes means that plaintiffs that appear to have been harmed by a professional have no remedy. For example, in <i>Osborn</i>, the trial was conducted on the basis of the normal breach analysis with expert evidence offered as to the feasibility of performing blood tests at a low cost (burden) in the face of increasing awareness of the devastating impact of tainted blood being given to unsuspecting patients (the foreseeable risk of harm). One can easily view the case as exemplifying the observation from <i>The T.J. Hooper</i> of an entire industry lagging behind the care that a reasonable person would adhere to in a given circumstance. The same observations might be made of the lawyers effectuating service of process in a rather informal manner in <i>Hodges</i> when serving process the lawful way would impose no great burden. Critics of the professional standard would thus use both of these cases as examples of why the reasonable person standard, as applied in <i>The T.J. Hooper</i>, should always be applied. But, the majority of courts continue to apply the professional standard to professional groups.</p>
<p id="65d937b7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Expert Witnesses.</i></b> When the professional standard applies, the jury needs information about the applicable professional customs. The only persons with personal knowledge of these customs are experts practicing within that profession. In this way, courts have held that expert testimony is essential in such cases to inform the jury of the governing standard. Interestingly, a defendant in a malpractice case necessarily qualifies as such an expert witness and is <span title="447" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-447">p. 447</span>permitted to offer testimony on their own behalf—presumably always testifying that they met the standard (or else the case needs to settle). Plaintiffs in malpractice cases need the testimony of another professional setting forth an applicable custom to which the defendant did not adhere in order to have a potential claim of malpractice for a jury to even consider. Many malpractice cases involve defendants filing motions for summary judgment attacking the adequacy of the plaintiff’s evidence of deviation from a professional custom. Plaintiffs can either hire a testifying expert witness from within the profession or, in some cases, offer the opinions from another professional who has dealt with the plaintiff. For example, in some medical malpractice cases a subsequent doctor has treated the plaintiff to remedy a complication from the original doctor’s treatment. So long as that other doctor is practicing in the same specialty area as the defendant, if the subsequent treating doctor has critical opinions concerning noncompliance with the governing customs, this can form a sufficient basis for the malpractice claim. A cottage industry has arisen for certain professionals to make themselves available for hire as expert witnesses (for either side) in malpractice cases. When juries hear testimony from dueling expert witnesses as to prevailing customs, the jury needs to determine as a factual matter whom to believe.</p>
<p id="65d937b8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Competing Schools of Thought.</i></b> In a given situation, a profession may not uniformly act in one particular way. When a certain type of cancer is diagnosed in a patient, for example, the specialists involved in treating the cancer may have differences of opinion regarding surgical intervention, radiation and/or chemotherapy. In other words, there may be multiple <i>schools of thought</i> within a profession as to the proper course of treatment. In such cases, so long as the defendant doctor has adhered to one of the recognized schools of thought, the doctor has met the duty of care and is not liable for malpractice. There is a lot of potential for dispute as to whether a practice constitutes a recognized school of thought or whether it merely evidences a handful of doctors committing malpractice. These matters are usually left for the jury to decide upon hearing the testimony from the competing expert witnesses.</p>

<p id="65d937bc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Doctors and lawyers have always been considered professionals for purposes of analyzing their potential negligence. For this reason, negligence claims against them are called “malpractice” cases. Who else is a professional? Does the professional standard apply to anyone practicing a craft that seems complicated? How about pharmaceutical companies or automobile manufacturers? If we are too liberal in allowing different industries to qualify for professional status, then the well-reasoned opinion in <i>The T.J. Hooper</i> becomes meaningless. Even tug <span title="448" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-448">p. 448</span>boat owners will simply declare themselves professionals and lag behind the expectations for reasonable care with impunity. The <i>Rossell</i> case below does an excellent job discussing this question and suggests a framework for analyzing how the courts should define the word “professional.” As you read the following case, consider why this issue is so important to the outcome of the case and why the court rejects the professional label for the defendant.</p>

<p id="65d95ed3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is a product liability action brought by Phyllis A. Rossell, as guardian ad litem on behalf of her daughter, Julie Ann Kennon (plaintiff), against the manufacturer and the North American distributor of Volkswagen automobiles. The defendants will be referred to collectively as “Volkswagen.” The case involves the design of the battery system in the model of the Volkswagen automobile popularly known as the “Beetle” or “Bug.” The jury found for the plaintiff and awarded damages in the sum of $1,500,000. The court of appeals held that the plaintiff had failed to establish a prima facie case of negligence…and that the trial judge had erred in denying Volkswagen’s motion for judgment n.o.v.</p>
<p id="65d95ed4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This action arises from a 1970, one-vehicle accident. At the time of the accident Julie, then eleven months old, was sleeping in the front passenger seat of a 1958 Volkswagen driven by her mother. At approximately 11:00 p.m., on State Route 93, Ms. Rossell fell asleep and the vehicle drifted to the right, off the paved roadway. The sound of the car hitting a sign awakened Rossell, and she attempted to correct the path of the car, but oversteered. The car flipped over, skidded off the road and landed on its roof at the bottom of a cement culvert. The force of the accident dislodged and fractured the battery which was located inside the passenger compartment. In the seven hours it took Rossell to regain full consciousness and then extract herself and her daughter from the car, the broken battery slowly dripped sulfuric acid on Julie. The acid severely burned her face, chest, arm, neck, part of her back and shoulder, and both hands. Since the accident Julie has undergone extensive corrective surgery but remains seriously disfigured and in need of additional surgery.</p>
<p id="65d95ed5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff filed the complaint in May, 1978. She alleged…negligent design of the battery system [among other claims]. [At trial,] the case was submitted to the jury only on the question of Volkswagen’s negligence in locating the battery inside the passenger compartment.</p>
<p id="65d95ed6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff argued at trial that battery placement within the passenger compartment created an unreasonable risk of harm and that alternative designs were available and practicable. In their trial motions and later motion for <span title="449" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-449">p. 449</span>judgment n.o.v., Volkswagen argued that plaintiff had failed to make a prima facie case. First, it claimed that in a negligent design case the defendant must comply with the standard of a reasonably prudent designer of automobiles and that</p>

<p id="65d95ed7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">knowledge of automobile design principles and engineering practices often is beyond the knowledge of laymen, [so that] plaintiff in a case such as this must produce expert testimony establishing the minimum standard of care and deviation therefrom in designing the automobile.…</p></div>
<p id="65d95ed8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">The trial judge characterized Volkswagen’s position as a contention that plaintiff could not prevail in the</p>

<p id="65d95ed9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">absence of testimony…from a qualified expert as opposed to simply permitting the jury to infer it,…that the standard of care required of a prudent manufacturer would require that the battery be placed elsewhere [or that] it was negligent…not to have placed it outside of the passenger compartment.</p></div>
<p id="65d95eda-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">The trial judge disagreed with Volkswagen and denied the motion for judgment n.o.v. However, a majority of the court of appeals held that such evidence was required for a prima facie case.</p>
<p id="65d95edb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">…</p>
<p id="65d985ec-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We turn, then, to the central issue presented. What type of proof must plaintiff produce in order to make a prima facie case of negligent design against a product manufacturer? What is the standard of care? In the ordinary negligence case, tried under the familiar rubric of “reasonable care,” plaintiff’s proof must provide facts from which the jury may conclude that defendant’s behavior fell below the “reasonable man” standard. Prosser, <i>supra</i> §31 at 169. This question is ordinarily decided without providing the jury with any direct evidence about the details of what may or may not comply with the standard of care. The risk/benefit analysis involved in deciding what is reasonable care under the circumstances is generally left to the jury….</p>
<p id="65d985ed-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, in the usual negligence case the jury is left to reach its own conclusion on whether defendant’s conduct complied with the legal standard of reasonable care. There need be no opinion testimony on the subject; the jury is encouraged, under proper instruction, to consider the circumstances, use its own experience and apply community standards in deciding what is or is not negligence.</p>
<p id="65d985ee-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Volkswagen claims that negligent design cases are an exception. They contend that product manufacturers are held to an expert’s standard of care, as are professionals such as lawyers, doctors and accountants. In professional malpractice cases the reasonable man standard has been replaced with the standard of “what is customary and usual in the profession.” Prosser, <i>supra</i> §32, at 189. This, of course, requires plaintiff to establish by expert testimony the usual conduct of other practitioners of defendant’s profession and to prove, further, that defendant deviated from that standard.</p>

<p id="65d985ef-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It has been pointed out often enough that this gives the medical profession, and also the [other professions], the privilege, <i>which is usually emphatically denied to other groups</i>, of setting their own legal standards of conduct, merely by adopting their own practices.</p></div>
<p id="65d985f0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush"><i>Id.</i> (emphasis supplied) (citations omitted).</p>
<p id="65d985f1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Should we adopt for manufacturers in negligent design cases a rule “emphatically denied to other groups” but similar to those applied to defendants in professional malpractice cases? Such a rule, of course, would require—not just permit—plaintiff to present explicit evidence of the usual conduct of other persons in the field of design by offering expert evidence of what constitutes “good design practice.” Plaintiff would also be required to establish that the design adopted by the defendant deviated from such “good practice.” We believe that such a rule is inappropriate.</p>
<p id="65d985f2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The malpractice requirement that plaintiff show the details of conduct practiced by others in defendant’s profession is not some special favor which the law gives to professionals who may be sued by their clients. It is, instead, a method of holding such defendants to an even higher standard of care than that of an ordinary, prudent person. Prosser, <i>supra</i> §32 at 185. Such a technique has not been applied in commercial settings, probably because the danger of allowing a commercial group to set its own standard of what is reasonable is not offset by professional obligations which tend to prevent the group from setting standards at a low level in order to accommodate other interests. Thus, it is the general law that industries are not permitted to establish their own standard of conduct because they may be influenced by motives of saving “time, effort or money.” Prosser, <i>supra</i> §33 at 194. Long ago, Judge Learned Hand expressed the rule in a case in which the defendant claimed that it had not been negligent in failing to put Mr. Marconi’s invention on its tugboats:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65d985f3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is it then a final answer that the business had not yet generally adopted receiving sets?…Indeed in most cases reasonable prudence is in fact common prudence; but strictly it is never its measure; a whole calling may have unduly lagged in the adoption of new and available devices. It never may set its own tests, however persuasive be its usages. Courts must in the end say what is required; there are precautions so imperative that even their universal disregard will not excuse their omission.</p></div>
<p id="65d985f4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush"><i>The T.J. Hooper</i>, 60 F.2d 737, 740 (2d Cir.1932). This, of course, is not to say that evidence of custom and usage is inadmissible.</p>
<p id="65d985f5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Volkswagen argues that case law already recognizes that in negligent design cases a manufacturer is not liable absent a showing that he failed to conform to the standard of care in design followed by other manufacturers. We do not agree.</p>
<p id="65d985f6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In view of public policy and existing law, we decline to transform defective design cases into malpractice cases. We believe the law is best left as it is in this <span title="451" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-451">p. 451</span>field. Special groups will be allowed to create their own standards of reasonably prudent conduct only when the nature of the group and its special relationship with its clients assure society that those standards will be set with primary regard to protection of the public rather than to such considerations as increased profitability. We do not believe that automobile manufacturers fit into this category. This is no reflection upon automobile manufacturers, but merely a recognition that the necessities of the marketplace permit manufacturers neither the working relationship nor the concern about the welfare of their customers that the professions generally permit and require from their practitioners.</p>
<p id="65d985f7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Therefore, in Arizona the rule in negligence cases shall continue to be that evidence of industry custom and practice is generally admissible as evidence relevant to whether defendant’s conduct was reasonable under the circumstances. In determining what is reasonable care for manufacturers, the plaintiff need only prove the defendant’s conduct presented a foreseeable, unreasonable risk of harm. As in all other negligence cases, the jury is permitted to decide what is reasonable from the common experience of mankind. We do not disturb the rule that in determining what is “reasonable care,” expert evidence may be required in those cases in which factual issues are outside the common understanding of jurors. However, unlike most malpractice cases, there need not be explicit expert testimony establishing the standard of care and the manner in which defendant deviated from that standard. With these principles in mind, we now turn to a consideration of the evidence in order to determine whether plaintiff did prove a prima facie case.</p>
<p id="65d985f8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff presented two experts, Jon McKibben, an automotive engineer, and Charles Turnbow, a safety engineer. Their testimony established that the great majority of cars on the road at the time the Beetle in question was designed had batteries located outside the passenger compartment, usually in the engine compartment and occasionally in the luggage compartment. There was evidence from which the jury could find that from both an engineering and practical standpoint the 1958 Volkswagen could have been designed with the battery outside the passenger compartment, as was the Karmann Ghia, an upscale model which used the same chassis as the Beetle. There was further testimony that placement of the battery inside the passenger compartment was unreasonably dangerous because “batteries do fracture in crashes, not infrequently.”</p>
<p id="65d9ad09-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that the plaintiff did present expert evidence that the battery design location presented a foreseeable, unreasonable risk of harm, that alternative designs were available and that they were feasible from a technological and practical standpoint. We reject Volkswagen’s contention that in addition to the evidence outlined above, plaintiff was compelled to produce expert opinion evidence that the standard of “good design practice” required Volkswagen to design the car so that the battery system was located outside the passenger compartment. Unlike a malpractice case, the jury was free to reach or reject this conclusion on the basis of its own experience and knowledge of what <span title="452" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-452">p. 452</span>is “reasonable,” with the assistance of expert opinion describing only the dangers, hazards and factors of design involved.</p>
<p id="65d9ad0a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The opinion of the court of appeals is vacated. The judgment is affirmed.</p>

In this regard, it gives two primary considerations for determining that a group deserves the status as a profession: (1) the nature of the group, and (2) whether it has special relationships with its clients. With respect to the nature of the group, the court observes that professional groups have self-imposed “professional obligations” and also tend to be somewhat insulated from “motives of saving time, effort, or money” in setting customs. The court then determines that automobile manufacturers lack the same relationships with their customers that doctors and lawyers have with their patients and clients, and that such manufacturers are driven by profit (presumably from their shareholders) without offsetting professional obligations (e.g., rules of professional responsibility for lawyers and the Hippocratic oath for doctors). Ultimately, what the courts say about commercial industry groups is that they cannot be trusted to set their own standards for fear that the care necessary to protect their customers will be lacking. Viewed in this manner, the court in <i>Rossell</i> reaffirms the principles underlying Judge Hand’s decision in <i>The T.J. Hooper</i> while revealing why a departure from this principle is applicable to true professionals.</p>

<p id="65da4965-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">One unique subset of medical malpractice cases involves a physician who treats a patient without obtaining their <i>informed consent.</i> In such a case, the patient suffers some side effect from the treatment and claims that they would not have agreed to the treatment if the doctor had disclosed such risk as an inherent potential aspect of the treatment. If the bad outcome arises from faulty treatment it would be a normal medical malpractice case. But sometimes even when the treatment is appropriate and performed in conformance with applicable medical customs there may still be certain inherent risks of some side effects. It is in such instances, when a patient who experiences such a side effect from otherwise proper treatment, that an informed consent claim may be available when the physician has failed to disclose this risk. Of course, if the doctor truly obtains no consent before treating a patient, the doctor may have committed a battery. What we are instead analyzing is the instance when the patient does give consent to the treatment but complains that it was not informed. Courts have recognized this type of claim as a subset of medical negligence but have had some difficulty analyzing the standard for determining what information must be disclosed and how to prove actual causation on this unique cause of action. The <i>Scott</i> case below illustrates a state’s decision to recognize this cause of action and determine the proper method to analyze it.</p>

<p id="65da707c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This appeal is taken by plaintiffs in trial below, from a judgment in favor of defendant rendered on a jury verdict in a medical malpractice action.</p>
<p id="65da707d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mrs. Scott’s physician advised her she had several fibroid tumors on her uterus. He referred her to defendant surgeon. Defendant admitted her to the hospital where she signed a routine consent form prior to defendant’s performing a hysterectomy. After surgery, Mrs. Scott experienced problems with incontinence. She visited another physician who discovered she had a vesico-vaginal fistula which permitted urine to leak from her bladder into the vagina. This physician referred her to an urologist who, after three surgeries, succeeded in correcting her problems.</p>

<p id="65da7080-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issue involved is whether Oklahoma adheres to the doctrine of informed consent as the basis of an action for medical malpractice, and if so did the present instructions adequately advise the jury of defendant’s duty.</p>
<p id="65da7081-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Anglo-American law starts with the premise of thoroughgoing self-determination, each man considered to be his own master. This law does not permit a physician to substitute his judgment for that of the patient by any form of artifice. The doctrine of informed consent arises out of this premise.</p>
<p id="65da7082-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consent to medical treatment, to be effective, should stem from an understanding decision based on adequate information about the treatment, the available alternatives, and the collateral risks. This requirement, labeled “informed consent,” is, legally speaking, as essential as a physician’s care and skill in the <i>performance</i> of the therapy. The doctrine imposes a duty on a physician or surgeon to inform a patient of his options and their attendant risks. If a physician breaches this duty, patient’s consent is defective, and physician is responsible for the consequences.</p>
<p id="65da7083-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If treatment is completely unauthorized and performed without any consent at all, there has been a battery. However, if the physician obtains a patient’s consent but has breached his duty to inform, the patient has a cause of action sounding in negligence for failure to inform the patient of his options, regardless of the due care exercised at treatment, assuming there is injury.</p>
<p id="65da7084-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Until today, Oklahoma has not officially adopted this doctrine.</p>
<p id="65da7085-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[I]n perhaps one of the most influential informed consent decisions, <i>Canterbury v. Spence</i>, 464 F.2d 772 (D.C. Cir. 1972) cert. den, 409 U.S. 1064, the doctrine received perdurable impetus. Judge Robinson observed that suits charging failure by a physician adequately to disclose risks and alternatives of proposed treatment were not innovative in American law. He emphasized the fundamental concept in American jurisprudence that every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body. True consent to what happens to one’s self is the informed exercise of a choice. This entails an opportunity to evaluate knowledgeably the options available and the risks attendant upon each. It is the prerogative of every patient to chart his own course and determine which direction he will take.</p>
<p id="65da7086-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The decision in <i>Canterbury</i> recognized the tendency of some jurisdictions to turn this duty on whether it is the custom of physicians practicing in the community to make the particular disclosure to the patient. That court rejected this standard and held the standard measuring performance of the duty of disclosure is conduct which is reasonable under the circumstances: “[We cannot] ignore the fact that to bind disclosure obligations to medical usage is to arrogate the decision on revelation to the physician alone.” We agree. A patient’s right to make up his mind whether to undergo treatment should not be delegated to the local medical group. What is reasonable disclosure in one instance may not be reasonable in another. We decline to adopt a standard based on the professional standard. We, therefore, hold the scope of a physician’s communications must be measured by his patient’s need to know enough to enable him to make an <span title="455" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-455">p. 455</span>intelligent choice. In other words, full disclosure of all <i>material risks</i> incident to treatment must be made. There is no bright line separating the material from the immaterial; it is a question of fact. A risk is material if it would be likely to affect patient’s decision. When non-disclosure of a particular risk is open to debate, the issue is for the finder of facts.</p>
<p id="65da7087-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This duty to disclose is the first element of the cause of action in negligence based on lack of informed consent. However, there are exceptions creating a privilege of a physician not to disclose. There is no need to disclose risks that either ought to be known by everyone or are already known to the patient. Further, the primary duty of a physician is to do what is best for his patient and where full disclosure would be detrimental to a patient’s total care and best interests a physician may withhold such disclosure, for example, where disclosure would alarm an emotionally upset or apprehensive patient. Certainly too, where there is an emergency and the patient is in no condition to determine for himself whether treatment should be administered, the privilege may be invoked.</p>
<p id="65da7088-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The patient has the burden of going forward with evidence tending to establish prima facie the essential elements of the cause of action. The burden of proving an exception to his duty and thus a privilege not to disclose, rests upon the physician as an affirmative defense.</p>
<p id="65da7089-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The cause of action, based on lack of informed consent, is divided into three elements: the duty to inform being the first, the second is causation, and the third is injury. The second element, that of causation, requires that plaintiff patient would have chosen no treatment or a different course of treatment had the alternatives and material risks of each been made known to him. If the patient would have elected to proceed with treatment had he been duly informed of its risks, then the element of causation is missing. In other words, a causal connection exists between physician’s breach of the duty to disclose and patient’s injury when and only when disclosure of material risks incidental to treatment would have resulted in a decision against it. A patient obviously has no complaint if he would have submitted to the treatment if the physician had complied with his duty and informed him of the risks. This fact decision raises the difficult question of the correct standard on which to instruct the jury.</p>
<p id="65da979a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court in <i>Canterbury v. Spence, supra</i>, although emphasizing principles of self-determination permits liability only if non-disclosure would have affected the decision of a fictitious “reasonable patient,” even though actual patient testifies he would have elected to forego therapy had he been fully informed.</p>
<p id="65da979b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Decisions discussing informed consent have emphasized the <i>disclosure</i> element but paid scant attention to the consent element of the concept, although this is the root of causation. Language in some decisions suggest the standard to be applied is a subjective one, i.e., whether that particular patient would still have consented to the treatment, reasonable choice or otherwise. <i>See Woods v. Brumlop</i>, <i>supra, n.8</i>; <i>Wilkinson v. Vesey</i>, <i>supra, n.3</i>; <i>Gray v. Grunnagle</i>, 223 A.2d <span title="456" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-456">p. 456</span>663 (Pa. 1966); <i>Poulin v. Zartman</i>, 542 P.2d 251 (Alas. 1975) reh. den., 548 P.2d 1299 (Alas. 1976).</p>
<p id="65da979c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the <i>Canterbury</i> rule is probably that of the majority, its “reasonable man” approach has been criticized by some commentators as backtracking on its own theory of self-determination. The <i>Canterbury</i> view certainly severely limits the protection granted an injured patient. To the extent the plaintiff, given an adequate disclosure, would have declined the proposed treatment, and a reasonable person in similar circumstances would have consented, a patient’s right of self-determination is <i>irrevocably lost.</i> This basic right to know and decide is the reason for the full-disclosure rule. Accordingly, we decline to jeopardize this right by the imposition of the “reasonable man” standard.</p>
<p id="65da979d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If a plaintiff testifies he would have continued with the proposed treatment had he been adequately informed, the trial is over under either the subjective or objective approach. If he testifies he would not, then the causation problem must be resolved by examining the credibility of plaintiff’s testimony. The jury must be instructed that it must find plaintiff would have refused the treatment if he is to prevail.</p>
<p id="65da979e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although it might be said this approach places a physician at the mercy of a patient’s hindsight, a careful practitioner can always protect himself by insuring that he has adequately informed each patient he treats. If he does not breach this duty, a causation problem will not arise.</p>
<p id="65da979f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The final element of this cause of action is that of injury. The risk must actually materialize and plaintiff must have been injured as a result of submitting to the treatment. Absent occurrence of the undisclosed risk, a physician’s failure to reveal its possibility is not actionable.</p>
<p id="65da97a0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In summary, in a medical malpractice action a patient suing under the theory of informed consent must allege and prove:</p>

<p id="65da97a4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because we are imposing a new duty on physicians, we hereby make this opinion prospective only, affecting those causes of action arising after the date this opinion is promulgated.</p>
<p id="65da97a5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court in the case at bar gave rather broad instructions upon the duty of a physician to disclose. The instructions objected to did instruct that defendant should have disclosed material risks of the hysterectomy and feasibility of alternatives. Instructions are sufficient when considered as a whole they present the law applicable to the issues. Jury found for defendant. We find no basis for reversal.</p>

<div class="epub-heading cc-font-xlarge left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="65dabeb7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b">NOTES AND PROBLEMS</p></h3></div>
<p id="65dabeb8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Standard for Determining the Duty.</i></b> Courts have recognized the informed consent cause of action based upon the principle of autonomy of the individual to make their own medical decisions. If the doctor obtains your consent without advising you of the possible negative aspects of treatment, courts conclude that the doctor has committed a form of medical malpractice. Originally, as courts recognized this type of malpractice claim they naturally utilized the professional standard of care as they would with any other malpractice claim. That is, the governing standard was what other similar medical professionals advised their patients about the side effects of the treatment. In the case above, the <i>Scott</i> court rejects this standard for several reasons, but most importantly because the professional standard is inconsistent with the autonomy at the heart of the informed consent claim. The professional standard applied in this context seems inappropriately paternalistic to most modern courts. Instead, the courts have adopted the objective, reasonably prudent patient standard in deciding what side effects of treatment are “material.” The biggest criticism of this standard is that it leaves doctors in an awkward gray zone where it may not be clear (until after a malpractice case is filed and tried to a jury) to a doctor what possible ill effects need to be disclosed. It can result in the defensive practice of medicine with doctors disclosing every far-flung remote side effect possible. As a consequence, patients may have a hard time deciphering the significant risks from the theoretical risks.</p>
<p id="65dabeb9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Causation Analysis.</i></b> The second issue the courts adopting this cause of action have to determine is what standard should be used in assessing actual but-for causation. After all, just because the patient suffers the side effect does not establish causation by itself because the malpractice is not in the manner of treatment but in the failure to let the patient make the treatment decision. If the patient would have opted for the treatment even with full disclosure it is difficult to see how the malpractice has caused any harm. Courts have chosen between the objective, reasonably prudent patient standard or the actual subjective statements of the plaintiff. Many courts have opted for the objective standard for causation out of practical recognition that any informed consent plaintiff, aided by hindsight, is likely to testify that she would have declined the treatment if only she had known of the risk. Even with this possibility, the <i>Scott</i> court still rejects this objective standard for causation because the plaintiff ultimately has the choice to accept or reject treatment and this choice is so personal that it should not matter if the decision was reasonably made. The jury, of course, can still reject a plaintiff’s self-serving testimony if they do not find the plaintiff credible.</p>
<p id="65dabeba-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Emergency Consent.</i></b> As the court observes in <i>Scott</i>, in emergency scenarios where the patient is not able to give consent to necessary treatment, <span title="458" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-458">p. 458</span>courts have allowed doctors the privilege to provide medical care given in good faith. Of course, if the treatment itself falls below the professional standard, the doctor can still be subject to a malpractice suit.</p>

<p id="65dabebd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Another important issue courts have faced is how far the duty of care stretches for professionals. Specifically, courts have sometimes faced malpractice claims brought by a non-client of the professional. In the <i>Elliott</i> case below, one state’s highest court has to determine whether a lawyer can be subject to a legal malpractice suit brought by individuals who claim to have been adversely impacted by the lawyer’s possible mistakes in performing some estate planning for his client. There are powerful reasons given to permit this claim to go forward, as many courts have done in similar circumstances, but this court determines that it is more important to limit the duty of the lawyer.</p>

<p id="65dabec4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issue presented is whether an attorney who negligently drafts a will or trust agreement owes a duty of care to persons intended to benefit under the will or trust, even though the attorney never represented the intended beneficiaries. The court of appeals held that the attorney owed no duty to the beneficiaries, affirming the trial court’s summary judgment for the defendant-attorney. Because the attorney did not represent the beneficiaries, we likewise conclude that he owed no professional duty to them. We accordingly affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>
<p id="65dabec5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After Frances Barcelo retained attorney David Elliott to assist her with estate planning, Elliott drafted a will and inter vivos trust agreement for her. The will provided for specific bequests to Barcelo’s children, devising the residuary of her estate to the inter vivos trust. Under the trust agreement, trust income was to be distributed to Barcelo during her lifetime. Upon her death, the trust was to terminate, assets were to be distributed in specific amounts to Barcelo’s children and siblings, and the remainder was to pass to Barcelo’s six grandchildren. The trust agreement contemplated that the trust would be funded by cash and shares of stock during Barcelo’s lifetime, although the grandchildren contend that this never occurred. Barcelo signed the will and trust agreement in September 1990.</p>
<p id="65dabec6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Barcelo died on January 22, 1991. After two of her children contested the validity of the trust, the probate court, for reasons not disclosed on the record <span title="459" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-459">p. 459</span>before us, declared the trust to be invalid and unenforceable. Barcelo’s grandchildren—the intended remainder beneficiaries under the trust—subsequently agreed to settle for what they contend was a substantially smaller share of the estate than what they would have received pursuant to a valid trust.</p>
<p id="65dae4d7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Barcelo’s grandchildren then filed the present malpractice action against Elliott and his law firm (collectively “Elliott”). Plaintiffs allege that Elliott’s negligence caused the trust to be invalid, resulting in foreseeable injury to the plaintiffs. Elliott moved for summary judgment on the sole ground that he owed no professional duty to the grandchildren because he had never represented them. The trial court granted Elliott’s motion for summary judgment.</p>
<p id="65dae4d8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court of appeals affirmed, concluding that under Texas law an attorney preparing estate planning documents owes a duty only to his or her client—the testator or trust settlor—not to third parties intended to benefit under the estate plan.</p>
<p id="65dae4d9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The sole issue presented is whether Elliott owes a duty to the grandchildren that could give rise to malpractice liability even though he represented only Frances Barcelo, not the grandchildren, in preparing and implementing the estate plan.</p>
<p id="65dae4da-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At common law, an attorney owes a duty of care only to his or her client, not to third parties who may have been damaged by the attorney’s negligent representation of the client. <i>See Savings Bank v. Ward</i>, 100 U.S. 195, 200 (1879); Annotation, <i>Attorney’s Liability, to One Other Than Immediate Client, for Negligence in Connection with Legal Duties</i>, 61 A.L.R. 4th 615, 624 (1988). Without this “privity barrier,” the rationale goes, clients would lose control over the attorney-client relationship, and attorneys would be subject to almost unlimited liability. Texas courts of appeals have uniformly applied the privity barrier in the estate planning context. <i>See Thomas v. Pryor</i>, 847 S.W.2d 303, 304-05 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1992), <i>judgm’t vacated by agr.</i>, 863 S.W.2d 462 (Tex. 1993).</p>
<p id="65dae4db-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs argue, however, that recognizing a limited exception to the privity barrier as to lawyers who negligently draft a will or trust would not thwart the rule’s underlying rationales. They contend that the attorney should owe a duty of care to persons who were specific, intended beneficiaries of the estate plan. We disagree.</p>
<p id="65dae4dc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority of other states addressing this issue have relaxed the privity barrier in the estate planning context. <i>See Lucas v.

App. 647, 491 N.W.2d 282, 286 (Mich. Ct. App. 1992) (same); <i>Guy</i>, 459 A.2d at 751-52. The Supreme Court of Iowa, for example, held that</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65dae4de-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">a cause of action ordinarily will arise only when as a direct result of the lawyer’s professional negligence the testator’s intent as expressed in the testamentary instruments is frustrated in whole or in part and the beneficiary’s interest in the estate is either lost, diminished, or unrealized.</p></div>
<p id="65db0bef-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush"><i>Schreiner v. Scoville</i>, 410 N.W.2d 679, 683 (Iowa 1987).</p>
<p id="65db0bf0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree with those courts that have rejected a broad cause of action in favor of beneficiaries. These courts have recognized the inevitable problems with disappointed heirs attempting to prove that the defendant-attorney failed to implement the deceased testator’s intentions. Certainly allowing extrinsic evidence would create a host of difficulties. In <i>DeMaris v. Asti</i>, 426 So. 2d 1153, 1154 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1983), for example, the court concluded that “there is no authority—the reasons being obvious—for the proposition that a disappointed beneficiary may prove, by evidence totally extrinsic to the will, the testator’s testamentary intent was other than as expressed in his solemn and properly executed will.” Such a cause of action would subject attorneys to suits by heirs who simply did not receive what they believed to be their due share under the will or trust. This potential tort liability to third parties would create a conflict during the estate planning process, dividing the attorney’s loyalty between his or her client and the third-party beneficiaries.</p>
<p id="65db0bf1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, we believe that the more limited cause of action recognized by several jurisdictions also undermines the policy rationales supporting the privity rule. These courts have limited the cause of action to beneficiaries specifically identified in an invalid will or trust. Under these circumstances, courts have reasoned, the interests of the client and the beneficiaries are necessarily aligned, negating any conflict, as the attorney owes a duty only to those parties which the testator clearly intended to benefit. <i>See, e.g., Needham</i>, 459 A.2d at 1062.</p>
<p id="65db0bf2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In most cases where a defect renders a will or trust invalid, however, there are concomitant questions as to the true intentions of the testator. Suppose, for <span title="461" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-461">p. 461</span>example, that a properly drafted will is simply not executed at the time of the testator’s death. The document may express the testator’s true intentions, lacking signatures solely because of the attorney’s negligent delay. On the other hand, the testator may have postponed execution because of second thoughts regarding the distribution scheme. In the latter situation, the attorney’s representation of the testator will likely be affected if he or she knows that the existence of an unexecuted will may create malpractice liability if the testator unexpectedly dies.</p>
<p id="65db0bf3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The present case is indicative of the conflicts that could arise. Plaintiffs contend in part that Elliott was negligent in failing to fund the trust during Barcelo’s lifetime, and in failing to obtain a signature from the trustee. These alleged deficiencies, however, could have existed pursuant to Barcelo’s instructions, which may have been based on advice from her attorneys attempting to represent her best interests. An attorney’s ability to render such advice would be severely compromised if the advice could be second-guessed by persons named as beneficiaries under the unconsummated trust.</p>
<p id="65db0bf4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, we are unable to craft a bright-line rule that allows a lawsuit to proceed where alleged malpractice causes a will or trust to fail in a manner that casts no real doubt on the testator’s intentions, while prohibiting actions in other situations. We believe the greater good is served by preserving a bright-line privity rule which denies a cause of action to all beneficiaries whom the attorney did not represent. This will ensure that attorneys may in all cases zealously represent their clients without the threat of suit from third parties compromising that representation.</p>
<p id="65db0bf5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We therefore hold that an attorney retained by a testator or settlor to draft a will or trust owes no professional duty of care to persons named as beneficiaries under the will or trust.</p>
<p id="65db0bf6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs also contend that, even if there is no tort duty extending to beneficiaries of an estate plan, they may recover under a third-party-beneficiary contract theory. While the majority of jurisdictions that have recognized a cause of action in favor of will or trust beneficiaries have done so under negligence principles, some have allowed recovery in contract.</p>
<p id="65db0bf7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Texas, however, a legal malpractice action sounds in tort and is governed by negligence principles. <i>See Cosgrove v. Grimes</i>, 774 S.W.2d 662, 664 (Tex. 1989); <i>Willis v. Maverick</i>, 760 S.W.2d 642, 644 (Tex. 1988). <i>Cf. Heyer v. Flaig</i>, 70 Cal. 2d 223, 449 P.2d 161, 164, 74 Cal. Rptr. 225 (Cal. 1969) (recognizing that third-party-beneficiary contract theory “is conceptually superfluous since the crux of the action must lie in tort in any case; there can be no recovery without negligence”). Even assuming that a client who retains a lawyer to draft an estate plan intends for the lawyer’s work to benefit the will or trust beneficiaries, the ultimate question is whether, considering the competing policy implications, the lawyer’s professional duty should extend to persons whom the lawyer never represented. For the reasons previously discussed, we conclude that the answer is no.</p>
<p id="65db0bf8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>

<div class="epub-heading cc-font-xlarge left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="65db330a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b">NOTES AND PROBLEMS</p></h3></div>
<p id="65db330b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Privity as a Limit on Duty.</i></b> The <i>Elliott</i> court begins by recognizing the general rule that permits only clients to sue lawyers for malpractice. This privity rule helps to clarify to whom the lawyer owes a duty of care and helps to avoid a potential division of loyalties by the lawyer. The rule also facilitates the unhindered zealous representation of clients by lawyers without fear for the consequences of their representation on third parties. Against these good reasons for the limitation on duty, however, the court admits that the majority of courts in this estate-planning context are willing to recognize some claims by beneficiaries despite the lack of privity of contract with the lawyer. The broad exception permits any stranger to a will to argue that the lawyer’s neglect explains their absence from being named a beneficiary. Obviously recognizing such claims is potentially troublesome because anyone might make such a claim after the death of a wealthy individual. The narrow exception is more limited—it only applies to permit a malpractice claim by named beneficiaries when the will or trust instrument is declared invalid due to the lawyer’s negligence. The <i>Elliott</i> court says that trusts and wills are often held invalid for technical reasons that cast doubt on whether the instruments prepared by the lawyer accurately reflect the testator/client’s true intentions; the court was, therefore, unwilling to permit any exception to the strict privity rule for limiting the lawyer’s duty. This general issue comes up in other professional malpractice claims with most courts typically limiting the duty in a similar way. Generally only patients can sue doctors for malpractice. (Though recall under <i>Tarasoff</i> that third parties hurt by the patient can sometimes sue the patient’s doctor, but these are not technically considered malpractice claims.) This issue also comes up in accountant claims for negligent misrepresentation when investors claim the accountant’s errors misstated a company’s true financial picture. There is a wide body of conflicting case law in this accountant malpractice area with the traditional rule being one of strict privity but modern courts being willing to consider a somewhat broader rule of duty owed to known potential investors. <i>See e.g.</i>, Grant Thornton LLP v. Prospect High Income Fund, 314 S.W.3d 913 (Tex. 2010) (outlining the various approaches taken by courts on the extent of an accountant’s duty of care in negligent misrepresentation cases). This area of law is covered in Chapter 13 Business Torts.</p>
<p id="65db330c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Causation in a Legal Malpractice Claim.</i></b> If a lawyer is accused of mishandling a case for a client, proof of actual causation of harm must be predicated on proof that the client would have won the underlying case but for the lawyer’s negligence. To determine causation in the malpractice case, the jury has to decide not only the merits of the malpractice claim but the merits of the underlying suit as well. This concept of proving causation is referred to sometimes as the <i>trial within the trial</i>. In such a suit, much of the evidence offered will pertain to the merits of the initial suit, which the malpractice jury <span title="463" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-463">p. 463</span>will necessarily have to hear to determine if the lawyer’s mishandling of the initial case actually made any difference.</p>
<p id="65db330d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>No Mention of Mere Economic Harm Rule.</i></b> You may have wondered, as you read the foregoing decision denying recovery to the grandchildren, why the court did not just cite to the <i>mere economic harm</i> rule to reject a duty of care. Indeed, would not this doctrine preclude almost all legal malpractice claims—because lawyers’ mistakes usually do not result in physical injuries? For such claims, courts do not apply this doctrine because it is designed to provide a limit to otherwise unlimited potential liabilities. Because malpractice claims are already generally limited by the privity rule—a much narrower duty—there is no concern for far-flung unlimited liabilities rippling out from a lawyer’s mistakes. This is also true in other malpractice or negligent misrepresentation claims against other professionals, such as accountants. This is discussed further in Chapter 13 Business Torts.</p>

<p id="65db3310-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Negligence claims against professionals raise interesting issues in analyzing the breach of duty as well as causation. To the extent a defendant is part of a special group that, due to its nature and special relationships with clients/patients, can be trusted to set relatively high standards for itself, courts recognize a departure from the doctrine in <i>The T.J. Hooper</i> that we encountered in Chapter 4. Rather than utilize the reasonable man as the standard of care, courts instead look exclusively to industry custom. Where the professional is operating within a recognized school of thought in her profession, she operates in a safe harbor zone and cannot be proven to have breached her professional duty. If a breach of custom can be demonstrated, plaintiffs often have unique causation issues with which to contend. In medical malpractice cases, the plaintiff might have trouble proving but-for causation if the doctor’s negligence merely deprived the plaintiff of a somewhat better chance of recovery. If the negligence probably made no difference, some courts will reject any recovery and others will offer a reduced recovery based upon the percentage reduction times the actual harm actually experienced. In claims for failure to give informed consent, the plaintiff will need to demonstrate that either she or a reasonable patient would not have undergone the procedure with proper information about the inherent side effects. And in legal malpractice claims involving the mishandling of prior litigation, the jury will need to determine the merits of not only the malpractice allegations but also the merits of the underlying lawsuit—for unless the lawyer’s negligence turned a victory into a loss, the professional blunder would be considered nothing more than “negligence in the air” and would impose no liability on the lawyer.</p>

<p id="65db5a25-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">George lived in a suburban house by himself. Being an avid athlete, he purchased an in-ground basketball goal for his driveway and began to install this goal. He was pretty gifted with his hands and did not feel the need to consult the instructional manual. He worked on the goal for several hours and believed it was complete. There were some extra nuts and bolts left over. He considered testing the strength of the goal but ran out of time, as he desired to attend a floral exhibition at the community garden center.</p>
<p id="65db5a26-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dennis was a six-year-old boy that lived with his parents Henry and Alice, next door to George. He had a way of getting into trouble. George was constantly having to run Dennis off of his property, as Dennis was a cause of much consternation to George. On this particular date, Dennis was watching from a distance as George was building the new basketball goal. Dennis stood across the street bouncing a basketball, eagerly anticipating the chance to shoot baskets. As George drove off, Dennis ran onto George’s property and began shooting baskets. Dennis noticed a mini-trampoline in George’s garage. He had seen mascots at basketball games jump from such trampolines to dunk a basketball and decided to do likewise. On his first attempt, he soared into the air, dunked the basketball, and then grabbed the rim for dear life. His weight was too much for the new goal. As it turns out, some necessary screws had been left unsecured in the goal. The entire apparatus fell over on top of poor Dennis. Dennis lay on the ground screaming in agony. A few minutes later, a schoolmate named Tommy came walking by. He saw Dennis in pain and ran to his assistance. Tommy had seen CPR performed on television and, despite the fact that Dennis was conscious, he began pounding on Dennis’s chest. This caused Dennis’s sternum to crack and made Dennis’ condition worse.</p>
<p id="65db5a27-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Eventually an ambulance arrived. The paramedics secured Dennis into their vehicle and rushed toward the hospital. At the hospital, the emergency room physician set some open fractures in Dennis’s arm and provided him with pain medication. She did not, however, prescribe any antibiotics for the open wound. A few days after his discharge, Dennis’s wounds became horribly infected and he went to see a different doctor at the same hospital. This doctor, a surgeon, ultimately determined that the arm could not be saved and amputated it. The surgeon indicated that his personal practice would be to always give antibiotics for compound fractures. While this would not absolutely prevent all infections, it made them less likely to occur.</p>

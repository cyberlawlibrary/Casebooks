<p id="65f9b796-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have spent significant time exploring the details of various tort mainstay causes of action, including a wide variety of intentional torts as well as the behemoth known as negligence law. Then we delved into a number of different affirmative defenses—doctrines that could cause a plaintiff to lose a suit despite being able to prove each and every element of her claim. You might think that you are done, but the fun is just beginning. Because almost all civil tort claims are brought for the recovery of damages, no analysis of a tort claim is fully complete without considering the damages to which a plaintiff might be entitled. Stated another way, without the recovery of damages, there would be virtually no tort litigation. This chapter will demonstrate both the principles governing and the process of ascertaining damages for which a plaintiff might seek recovery. We will begin with a discussion of actual damages, both economic and non-economic, and discover certain rules setting parameters for both the nature and scope of recovery of these compensatory damages, as well as some of the procedures <span title="554" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-554">p. 554</span>available for proving such damages to the jury. And though they are rarely awarded, no discussion of tort remedies would be complete without considering the prospect of a punitive damage recovery. With regard to such exemplary damages, we will consider both the issue of what misconduct is sufficiently perverse in the eyes of the law to justify the doling out of punishment in a civil suit, and what limits (either constitutional or statutory) might restrict the jury’s discretion.</p>

<p id="65f9b79f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Actual damages awards are designed to make the victim whole by compensating the victim for the harm that has been suffered (past damages) as of the time of trial and all damages likely to be suffered after the trial (future damages). This remedial purpose is why actual damages also go by the name compensatory damages. The two categories of actual damages are often referred to as <i>special</i> and <i>general</i>. Special damages are economic harms caused by the defendant’s misconduct. These are called economic because the items in this category relate to matters for which there are objective economic values in the marketplace. For example, economic losses include lost wages or earning capacity, medical expenses, and property repairs (or lost fair market value of property). Every day medical expenses are, in effect, bought and sold in doctors’ offices and hospitals. Medicines have a particular purchase price. When someone has been unable to work due to the accident, the fact finder can ascertain what that person would have earned from their job had they not been hurt. For future lost earning capacity (if the plaintiff’s injuries will prevent her from doing some jobs in the future) it is possible to estimate what her earning power would have been in the market but for the injuries. Many times, some of these items of <span title="555" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-555">p. 555</span>damages are relatively non-controversial. Simply keeping receipts for certain expenses incurred from injuries can suffice to prove elements of such a loss. Other times, the parties may end up going to trial over disputed issues of economic losses. The <i>Martin</i> case below offers a good foray into a fact finder’s analysis in setting compensatory damages. We get to peek into the mind of the fact finder because it was a bench trial (due to being a FTCA claim against the U.S. government), and the judge has written findings of fact supporting the entry of a damage award. As you read this opinion, pay close attention to the details of how the court goes about calculating the special damages.</p>

Defendant also noted that the award could be immediately invested by the plaintiff to generate a return that would at least partially offset future medical care cost inflation.

<p id="65fa540b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Medical Expenses.</i></b> Tortfeasors are required to pay for the medical expenses incurred in good faith for injuries caused by a tortfeasor’s misconduct. Courts frequently speak in terms of medical expenses that were “reasonable and necessary” as proper items for inclusion in a damage award. When the services are obviously necessary there may be little dispute about this item of damages. But where it is unclear that treatment was associated solely with the injury caused by the tortfeasor, there may be a greater need for expert testimony (usually the treating health care provider) to prove the causal link between the expense and the incident. Future medical expenses almost always require expert testimony to prove that they will in “reasonable probability” be incurred in the future for the underlying condition.</p>
<p id="65fa540c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Lost Earning Capacity.</i></b> For past lost wages, reference for the amount lost is typically made to the job plaintiff actually had at the time of the incident. Where the injuries have prevented the plaintiff from working, often a simple mathematical calculation yields the past lost wages amount. Future lost earning capacity can be quite a bit trickier. One can obtain damages for future lost earning capacity even if not presently employed, so long as the evidence shows that the injuries will prevent employment that otherwise would have been forecast as likely to have occurred. In the <i>Martin</i> case, this required extrapolation, based upon the character traits of the minor plaintiff and the surrounding circumstances, as to what he likely would have done after reaching adulthood. This is, of course, inherently speculative, but it is a necessary exercise if the goal is to attempt to provide full compensation. <i>See</i> Feldman v. Allegheny Airlines, 382 F. Supp. 1271 (D. Conn. 1974) (approving the practice of extrapolating based upon the evolving pattern of the claimant’s life). A minority of courts will not permit such speculation into areas of employment never before achieved by a plaintiff. These courts tend to restrict generally future earning capacity to the same type of employment plaintiff has already achieved (subject to increases based upon seniority). <i>See</i> State v. Guinn, 555 P.2d 530 (Alaska 1976).</p>
<p id="65fa7b1d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Inflation.</i></b> The court in <i>Martin</i> had to increase the future earnings calculation based upon the assumption that cost of living raises in the applicable area of likely employment would increase during the work life expectancy of the plaintiff. Failure to take such inflationary pressures on earnings into account would otherwise result in not compensating the plaintiff for all of his actual losses. Courts used to refuse to use inflation to increase such future special damage awards because they felt that this was too speculative. But economists recognize the need to include inflationary adjustments, and courts have shifted positions on this issue today.</p>
<p id="65fa7b1e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Discounting to Present Value.</i></b> Also, in <i>Martin</i>, the court had to take the future special damages award and discount it so that the award today of future losses would not overcompensate the plaintiff. Without discounting to present <span title="560" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-560">p. 560</span>value, awards of future special damages would overcompensate a plaintiff because $1 today is worth more than $1 in the future due to the ability to invest that money. One legal scholar has explained the principle of reducing future awards of special damages to present value as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65fa7b1f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[I]t is assumed that the plaintiff will invest the sum awarded and receive interest thereon. That interest accumulated over the number of relevant years will be available, in addition to the capital, to provide the plaintiff with his future support until the total is exhausted at the end of the period. The projected interest must therefore be allowed in reduction of capital lest it be claimed that the plaintiff is overcompensated.</p></div>

Note the difference in opinions in <i>Martin</i> between experts as to the appropriate discount rate to use; the job of the fact finder is to employ a discount rate that reflects a reasonably safe investment. While the need to reduce to present value and the principles governing this calculation are clear, the proper rates to use can become a topic on which competing expert witnesses disagree in particular cases. Courts do not require that future awards of general, non-economic damages be discounted to present value.</p>
<p id="65fa7b21-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. <i>Total Offset Alternative.</i></b> If you are paying close attention to the math in the two foregoing notes, the thought should occur to you that on future special damages, we first increase the damages using a percentage (for inflation) and then decrease the damages using a percentage (the discount to present value number). Some courts believe that it is simpler and fairer to simply declare these two computations a “total offset” and to neither increase the future damages for inflation nor decrease them to present value. <i>See generally</i> Kaczkowski v. Bolubasz, 421 A.2d 1027 (Pa. 1980) (discussing the differences between the minority “total offset” position and the majority approach of increasing for inflation and then decreasing to present value). In most scenarios, the total offset approach is more plaintiff-friendly than the majority approach. This is because the discount rate is usually higher than the rate of inflation (or else people would not bother to invest money).</p>

This is true even for past lost wages and future lost earning capacity. Many states permit the fact finder to take into account the non-taxation on this element of recovery (by reducing the award to after-tax estimates of earnings) in order to avoid a windfall recovery to the plaintiff and the defendant paying an excessive amount of actual damages.</p>

<p id="65faf070-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>General damages</i> are another category of actual damages designed to compensate for <i>non-economic</i> harms—injuries for which there is no actual market value. It is conceptually difficult to quantify physical pain and suffering or emotional anguish in dollars and cents. These damages are simply incapable of exact mathematical calculation and this is qualitatively different than what we encountered with special damages. Yet money is the language of tort law no matter the type of harm involved. The tort goals we first encountered in Chapter 1—compensating worthy victims, deterring conduct that is likely to cause harm, and punishing misconduct—are all furthered through the auspices of a court order requiring a tortfeasor to pay a victim a certain amount of money. The primary dilemma with general damages is ascertaining when a jury’s award is appropriate. While juries are not permitted to receive evidence of other jury awards of general damages, the judges (both trial and appellate) frequently compare jury awards of general damages in order to determine if a challenged award seems appropriate. The <i>Miraglia</i> case below is an example of a trial court judge conducting such an analysis in a tragic case. You will notice perhaps that this analysis seems more akin to art than science.</p>

<p id="65faf073-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“We disagree with those students of tort law who believe that pain and suffering are not real costs and should not be allowable items of damages in a tort suit. No one likes pain and suffering and most people would pay a good deal of money to be free of them. If they were not recoverable in damages, the cost of negligence would be less to the tortfeasors and there would be more negligence, more accidents, more pain and suffering, and hence higher social costs.”</p>

</div>
<p id="65faf075-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because it is difficult for juries to find general damages and tougher yet for judges reviewing such verdicts to understand how a jury determined the dollar value of such intangible loss, the law of general damages often focuses upon controlling the type of evidence and arguments juries are permitted to hear on the topic. While their deliberations are, essentially, a “<i>black box</i>” into which we cannot peer to understand their findings, we can control which matters go into that black box. In this way, tort law hopes to promote rational and reasonable general damage findings by juries. We will explore some of these black box input rules.</p>
<p id="65faf076-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, we will consider the possibility of juries awarding, under different labels, damages for essentially the same harms. General damages include harms referred to by labels such as pain and suffering, emotional anguish (or mental distress), disfigurement, physical impairment or disability, loss of reputation, and loss of spousal or parental consortium. A classic example of the potential for double dipping in these losses comes with the additional item of general damages referred to as <i>hedonic losses</i>—loss of the intrinsic joy of life. We will encounter one court’s attempt to control the potential for juries making cumulative awards due to a request for compensation of this type of loss.</p>

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65faf07a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It would hardly be possible ever to compensate a person fully for pain and suffering. “No rational being would change places with the injured man for an amount of gold that would fill the room of the court, yet no lawyer would contend that such is the legal measure of damages.” Translating pain and anguish into dollars can, at best, be only an arbitrary allowance, and not a process of measurement, and consequently the judge can, in his instructions give the jury no standard to go by; he can only tell them to allow such amount as in their discretion they may consider reasonable. The chief reliance for reaching reasonable results in attempting to value suffering in terms of money must be the restraint and common sense of the jury.</p></div>

<p id="65fb1793-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff sustained serious and catastrophic injuries when he fell while traversing a trench at a construction site in the Bronx. As a result of plaintiff’s fall into a trench at the job site he became impaled on a reinforcement bar (rebar) that was surgically removed several hours after his admission to the hospital. It is in this setting that the jury, after a trial and after hearing testimony from plaintiff’s physicians and other experts (that was largely uncontroverted) regarding the devastating and traumatic nature of the injuries he sustained, rendered a verdict in the sum of $86 million including $20 million for past pain and suffering and $55 million for future pain and suffering.</p>
<p id="65fb1794-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff’s treating physician Dr. Carrano, the Director of Spinal Cord Services at Helen Hayes Hospital, described in explicit detail the nature and effect of the injuries plaintiff incurred. Dr. Carrano provided the court and jury with a <span title="564" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-564">p. 564</span>graphic picture of plaintiff’s suffering, stating in part, that the pain plaintiff continues to experience “is of two types. He has nerve pain in his legs, and that nerve pain is perhaps one of the worst pains that you could think of. Imagine somebody stabbing you with a knife, a gazillion times, or with a pin all over the place. That numbness, that tingling, that stabbing sensation” [is] “present all the time. But it is a constant pain and that pain will not go away.” Dr. Carrano depicted plaintiff’s chronic pain by providing the jury with a vivid description of the damage to plaintiff’s spinal column when the rebar went into the area of his spinal cord and the compression fracture also caused by the pipe entering his body. Dr. Carrano described the emotional pain sustained by the plaintiff caused by the distress of no longer having the ability to walk and the nerve pain emanating from his legs which Dr. Carrano testified was permanent. The jury also heard testimony regarding plaintiff’s chronic bed sores, his catherization in order to urinate, his inability to control bowel movements, constant urinary track infections and repeated hospitalization for the conditions described by Dr. Carrano.</p>
<p id="65fb1795-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Manifestly, pain and suffering awards are not subject to precise standards that permit a purely mathematically evaluation in order to determine whether a verdict deviates materially from what is reasonable compensation. CPLR §5501 requires that:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65fb1796-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In reviewing a money judgment in an action in which…it is contended that the award is excessive or inadequate and that a new trial should have been granted unless a stipulation is entered to a different award, the appellate division shall determine that an award is excessive or inadequate if it deviates materially from what would be reasonable compensation.</p></div>
<p id="65fb1797-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is well established that the language quoted, although specifically directed to the appellate courts, also applies to the trial court mandating the trial court to review jury awards to determine whether the award is excessive or inadequate. Consequently, review under CPLR 5501 requires the trial court to evaluate whether the award deviates from comparable awards and as the court observed in <i>Donlon v. City of New York</i>, 284 A.D.2d 13, reviewing comparable awards “cannot, due to the inherently subjective nature of non-economic awards, be expected to produce mathematically precise results, much less a per diem pain and suffering rate.” It is also evident that review of jury verdicts for personal injuries to ascertain whether the award is reasonable, involves questions of fact and is the peculiar function of the jury. If such principles are to be accorded weight, when reviewing the sufficiency or excessiveness of jury awards, the trial court should not blindly substitute its judgment for that of the jury without affording considerable deference to the jury’s interpretation of the evidence.</p>
<p id="65fb1798-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant Lane referred this Court to several cases in an effort to convince the Court that the award, in the instant case, is not fair and reasonable. The <span title="565" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-565">p. 565</span>Court also heard the arguments raised by counsel for each party and reviewed the cases cited by counsel which purport to support each party’s position regarding the verdict. At the outset, this court acknowledges that the verdict rendered by the jury in the case at bar is unprecedented in view of the evidence presented regarding plaintiff’s injuries and the jury award clearly exceeds what can be considered fair and reasonable.</p>
<p id="65fb1799-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lane’s counsel submitted approximately eighteen (18) prior verdicts to “enlighten the court and in a sense, may constrain it” <i>Senko v. Fonda</i>, 53 A.D.2d 638, 639, to support the contention that the award for pain and suffering cannot be justified. As previously stated, this Court recognizes that the jury award which approximates $86 million deviates from what can be considered fair and reasonable. However, this recognition regarding the size of the verdict in the instant case does not automatically carry with it the court’s determination that the award falls within the boundaries which Lane suggests would be a fair and reasonable award for the plaintiff, who concededly is a paraplegic experiencing constant pain.</p>
<p id="65fb179a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The court first reduced the jury’s award of $10 million for future medical expenses to $8,294,669, which was the actual amount testified to by plaintiff’s expert witnesses, a medical doctor, and an economist.]</p>
<p id="65fb179b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With respect to Lane’s contention that the award for pain and suffering deviates from reasonable compensation, counsel direct the Court’s attention to several cases where the plaintiff purportedly sustained similar or more significant injuries than the plaintiff in the instant action such as <i>Schifelbine</i>, where the award of $23,218.586 was substantially reduced; <i>Coniker v.

City of New York</i>, N.Y. L.J., Jan. 5, 1999, at 27 col 1, Sup. Ct. Bronx County, plaintiff was shot by a police officer, paraplegia injury, $76.4 million verdict reduced to $1 million for past pain and suffering and $7.5 million for future pain and suffering; <i>Torres v. City of New York</i>, 259 A.D.2d 693, the plaintiff who sustained a gun shot wound to his back which caused motor and sensory paralysis of the entire lower half of his body was awarded $11 million for pain and suffering and reduced to $2.5 million.</p>
<p id="65fb179c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[I]t is self-evident that reviewing prior verdicts furnishes “to the judicial mind some indication of the consensus of opinion of jurors and courts to the proper relation between the character of the injured and the amount of compensation awarded” (<i>Senko v. Fonda</i>, 53 A.D.2d 638). Evaluation of prior awards, in similar personal injury cases is intended to provide guidance to the court in resolving disputed contentions regarding the adequacy or inadequacy of a verdict so that issues such as prejudice or sympathy do not become the motivating factor for the award. The trial court, therefore, in reviewing a jury award must consider the nature of the injury sustained by the plaintiff, the plaintiff’s age, the physical condition of the plaintiff prior to the occurrence, the permanency of the injury sustained, plaintiff’s ability to return to gainful employment, the pain, both physical and emotional, experienced and to be experienced in the future, the extent of future hospitalization and ascertain whether the award in part was generated by the devastating effect of plaintiff’s injury. Here, x rays introduced at the trial showing the presence of the rebar that entered plaintiff’s body clearly invoked sympathy by the jury causing in part, a huge verdict that was intended to compensate the plaintiff not only for pain and suffering he sustained but the grief experienced by the impact of the steel rod entering his body. Manifestly, modification of damages awards cannot be based on past precedents alone and as the Appellate Division appropriately stated in <i>PoYee So v. Wing Tat Realty</i>:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65fb179d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although possessing the power to set aside an excessive jury verdict, a trial court should nonetheless be wary of substituting its judgment for that of a panel of fact finders whose peculiar function is the fixation of damages. Modification of damages, which is a speculative endeavor, cannot be based upon case precedent alone, because comparison of injuries in different cases is virtually impossible.</p></div>
<p id="65fb179e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In contrast to the cases cited by the defendant Lane, plaintiff’s counsel submits several cases where jury’s award were significantly larger than the awards <span title="567" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-567">p. 567</span>presented by the defendant. In <i>Bondi v. Bambrick</i>, 308 A.D.2d 330 (1st Dept.), plaintiff was severely injured when she was struck by the defendant who was operating his motor vehicle while intoxicated. Plaintiff was 35 years of age at the time of the accident and lost part of one leg, underwent nine surgeries, including skin grafts, two surgeries involving removal and relocation of muscle tissue with pervasive scarring and a wound at the area of the amputation that may never heal. The court held that the “total pain and suffering award of $9,750,000” <i>did not deviate from reasonable compensation</i>. In <i>Weigl v. Quincy Specialties Co.</i>, 735 N.Y.S.2d 729, the jury awarded plaintiff $20 million for pain and suffering that was reduced by the trial court to $8 million <i>and sustained by the appellate division</i>, (N.Y. 1st Dept. 2003). <i>Barnes v. City of New York</i> involved an action brought by a 22-year-old plaintiff to recover damages sustained when he was shot in the back by a police officer. The gunshot wound rendered Barnes a paraplegic with multiple psychological disorders. The trial court in Barnes reduced the jury award of $15 million for past pain and suffering and $35 million for future pain and suffering to a total of $9,750,000. The Court in <i>Mundy v. New York City Transit Authority</i>, 299 A.D.2d 243 (N.Y. 1st Dept. 2002) reviewed a verdict for $20 million for past pain and suffering and $10 million for future pain and suffering that was reduced to $3 million and $5 million respectively. This Court has also reviewed the award of $14 million to the plaintiff in <i>Waldron v. City of New York</i>, NYLJ, June 7, 2004, vol. 108; p. 5, who sustained a spinal injury that rendered him a paraplegic. The injuries he sustained which also included a T1 fracture, fractured ribs and a punctured lung were caused when he was shot by a police officer. The Court denied the city’s motion to set aside the verdict.</p>
<p id="65fb3eaf-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court’s review of the cases set forth in this opinion denotes the factors which are considered in assessing what would be reasonable compensation. This process, now completed, does not however provide a clear picture that permits the application of some formula that identifies the limits of compensation for injuries that parallel plaintiff’s suffering. It is undisputed that plaintiff who at one time was a strong and vibrant man is now a wheelchair-bound paraplegic. The devastating injury he sustained was caused by the pipe that upon entering his body destroyed his bowel requiring a colostomy bag to collect his waste matter and he is required to manage his bladder with catheters. Plaintiff’s nerve pain in his legs is continuous and permanent. Such injuries, including those previously described, including the permanency of his injuries and his inability to return to gainful employment, are the factors that this court has applied in determining what would be reasonable compensation.</p>
<p id="65fb3eb0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the foregoing reasons, this Court grants defendant’s motion to set aside the verdict as excessive unless within 30 days after service of a copy of this decision and order with notice of entry plaintiff stipulates to reduce the jury award for past pain and suffering from $20 million to $5 million; for future pain and suffering from $55 million to $10 million, and for future medical related expenses from $10 million to $8,295,000.</p>

<div class="epub-heading cc-font-xlarge left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="65fb3eb3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b">NOTES AND PROBLEMS</p></h3></div>
<p id="65fb3eb4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Comparison of Prior Jury Awards.</i></b> While it is customary for judges, both trial and appellate, to consider other juries’ awards in comparable cases to determine the reasonableness of general damage awards, courts forbid counsel from informing the jury of such awards. This might strike you as somewhat hypocritical, but the prevailing thought is that it would misdirect the jury’s attention away from the facts of the particular case before them. Not all courts agree that it is appropriate to consider, even on appeal, whether a jury’s award is consistent with other comparable cases. <i>See e.g.</i>, Ritter v. Stanton, 745 N.E.2d 828, 847-49 (Ind. Ct. App. 2001) (suggesting that aggressive comparability analysis by a court in review of a jury’s damage findings might violate at least the spirit of the 7th Amendment’s right to a jury trial).</p>
<p id="65fb3eb5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Remittitur and Additur.</i></b> The order of the court in <i>Miraglia</i> is an example of a remittitur. This is when the trial court advises the plaintiff that the plaintiff can either accept a reduction in the damages or else the trial court will grant a new trial. All courts have the power of remittitur. Additur is a related concept—when the court gives the defendant a choice of either accepting an increase to the damage award (when the jury’s award is too low in light of the evidence) or else the court will grant the plaintiff’s motion for a new trial. Federal courts do not have the power of additur.</p>
<p id="65fb3eb6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Attorney’s Fees.</i></b> U.S. courts follow the “American Rule” which generally requires litigants to pay for their own attorney’s fees. The only primary exceptions to this are when either a statute directs that the prevailing party recover their attorney’s fees (often in consumer rights and employment discrimination statutes) or if a governing contract between the litigants so provides. But in most tort claims, even the prevailing plaintiff often recovers only 50 percent to 60 percent of the actual amount awarded by the jury, and that assumes the defendant has the funds to satisfy the judgment. The remainder of the award is often taken up by attorney’s fees and other expenses (e.g., expert witness fees). There is some thought among plaintiffs’ counsel that one of the pragmatic purposes behind awards of general damages is to increase the total recovery enough to help the plaintiff pay off the attorney’s fees while still yielding a sufficient net recovery to help compensate for more tangible harms.</p>
<p id="65fb3eb7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Evidentiary Support for Future Pain and Suffering.</i></b> Where there is objective evidence that, due to the physical nature of the plaintiff’s injury, it is plainly apparent that she will likely suffer future pain and suffering, the plaintiff is not required to offer expert testimony to support such an award. On the other hand, where the injury is more subjective and less obvious to cause ongoing pain and suffering, most courts require expert medical testimony to support an award of future pain and suffering. For example, in Krause, Inc. v. Little, 34 P.3d <span title="569" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-569">p. 569</span>566, 572 (Nev. 2001), the court held that it was common knowledge that broken bones can cause continued pain and that no expert testimony was needed to permit a jury award of future pain and suffering damages. The court stated that the injury itself was objective, being observable and understandable without expert assistance. Another plaintiff complaining of sexual dysfunction, headaches, and backaches after having ten stitches in his head was not permitted such an award of future pain and suffering damages where the only evidence to support an inference of future pain and suffering was from the plaintiff’s subjective complaints. Thompson v. Port Authority of New York, 284 A.2d 232, (N.Y. App. Div. 2001).</p>

<p id="65fb3eba-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given the uncertainty and lack of mathematical precision regarding how the fact finder should translate non-economic harms into monetary awards, trial lawyers have been creative in trying to help the jury with this endeavor. Some controversies have arisen regarding certain practices that plaintiffs’ counsel have crafted to help the jury understand the seriousness of such harms. Consider the following jury argument regarding a hypothetical case with alleged pain and suffering as an item of possible damages:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65fb3ebb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ladies and gentlemen, the judge has instructed you that one of the items of damage for your consideration in this case, after you have found the defendant negligent, concerns my client Paul’s pain and suffering. This item actually refers to two related, serious harms—his physical pain that he endures constantly, twenty-four hours each and every day since the date the defendant’s careless driving caused the horrendous accident. You have also heard Paul’s personal family physician’s expert opinion that this type of pain will likely be a permanent part of the remaining twenty-five years of his expected life. Imagine that—25 years of ever-present pain. And there is also the associated mental horror of knowing that his life will be spent enduring such pain. Imagine the toll this will take. The best physicians can offer him no prospect of relief despite the best medical practices.</p>
<p id="65fb65cc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You are asked to do something difficult, which is to determine a monetary award for this lifetime of hurt. Let me suggest one technique that might help you a bit. Imagine what one day looks like for Paul. Better yet, imagine a single hour of his life. You’ve seen him grimace while testifying on the stand for about an hour, after walking slowly to the stand aided by his walking cane and his persistent limp. Now you have to decide what this pain is worth in terms of dollars. Let me just suggest a possible figure of $5 per hour. A pretty small sum isn’t it? Surely his pain is far worse than that, but we want to be reasonable. You, of course, might decide a smaller or larger sum is more appropriate. But if you start with a premise of $5 per hour, in one day he would suffer $120 dollars. In a month that would add up to merely $3,600—not a huge sum, considering a whole month of unrelenting pain and anguish. Even a whole year of that is $43,200. Anyway, you can do the rest of the math. Just take the annual figure and multiple it by Paul’s undisputed <span title="570" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-570">p. 570</span>remaining life expectancy to reach a possible award for his future pain and suffering. Perhaps this is helpful for you.</p></div>
<p id="65fb65cd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notice how this argument breaks down the victim’s lifetime of suffering into easily manageable units. Do you think such an argument would be more effective than standing in front of the jury and suggesting they award $1,000,000 to the plaintiff for his pain and suffering? The <i>Beagle</i> case explores some of the pros and cons of this practice and joins the majority view in ruling upon its legality.</p>

<p id="65fb65d4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff brought an action against defendants for personal injuries suffered by him as the result of an automobile accident. The jury returned a verdict in his favor in the sum of $1,719.48, and he appeals from the judgment entered thereon, contending that the damages awarded are inadequate as a matter of law. The only issue raised on this appeal by any of the parties is whether the trial court erred in prohibiting plaintiff’s counsel from stating in argument to the jury the amount of general damages claimed by plaintiff, either in terms of a total sum or of a sum for a time segment. We conclude it was error to restrict counsel’s arguments in that regard.</p>
<p id="65fb65d5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff’s injuries resulted from an accident in which a car driven by Kenneth Vasold went over an embankment while rounding a curve in the road. Vasold died as a result of his injuries. Plaintiff and two other occupants of the car were injured. In the complaint, plaintiff prayed for $61,025.18 in general damages, as well as compensation for medical expenses, loss of earnings, and costs of suit.</p>
<p id="65fb65d6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court informed plaintiff’s attorney in chambers that he would not be permitted to mention to the jury “the value of his action in dollars” in a lump sum or as to “any per diem damages such as so many dollars per day, or so many dollars per month” because “[Such] is not evidence.” In accordance with this request, counsel confined his arguments on the question of damages to the amount of past and anticipated medical expenses and loss of earnings, a description of plaintiff’s injuries, and general statements to the effect that plaintiff was entitled to recover for past and future pain and suffering resulting from the accident.</p>
<p id="65fb8ce7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of the most difficult tasks imposed upon a jury in deciding a case involving personal injuries is to determine the amount of money the plaintiff is to be awarded as compensation for pain and suffering. No method is available to the jury by which it can objectively evaluate such damages, and no witness may express his subjective opinion on the matter. In a very real sense, the jury is <span title="571" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-571">p. 571</span>asked to evaluate in terms of money a detriment for which monetary compensation cannot be ascertained with any demonstrable accuracy. As one writer on the subject has said, “Translating pain and anguish into dollars can, at best, be only an arbitrary allowance, and not a process of measurement, and consequently the judge can, in his instructions, give the jury no standard to go by; he can only tell them to allow such amount as in their discretion they may consider reasonable.…The chief reliance for reaching reasonable results in attempting to value suffering in terms of money must be the restraint and common sense of the jury.…” (McCormick on Damages, §88, pp. 318-319.)</p>
<p id="65fb8ce8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before turning to the question of the propriety of the so-called “per diem” argument [whereby counsel in argument segments the damages into a stated amount of money representing a certain time period, such as $5 for each day] it is significant to note that, while no case has been found specifically holding an attorney may inform the jury as to the total amount of the general damages sought by the plaintiff, there is a clear implication that such a statement may be made by an attorney, and defendants here do not seriously challenge plaintiff’s assertion that the trial court erred in limiting counsel’s argument in this regard.</p>
<p id="65fb8ce9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It has long been a courtroom practice of attorneys in this state to tell the jury the total amount of damages the plaintiff seeks, and no questioning of the technique has come to our attention. Moreover, an attorney may and frequently does read the complaint, including the prayer, to the jury.</p>
<p id="65fb8cea-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question whether an attorney may argue to the jury that his client’s damages for pain and suffering may be measured in terms of a stated number of dollars for specific periods of time presents a more difficult problem. Few issues in the area of tort law have evoked more controversy in the last decade. While no California case has decided the matter, the controversy has been resolved in most of our sister states and in some federal jurisdictions.</p>
<p id="65fb8ceb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Twenty-one jurisdictions which have passed on the issue permit an attorney to make the “per diem” argument. [<i>See e.g.</i>,] <i>Baron Tube Co. v. Transport Ins. Co</i>., 365 F.2d 858 (5th Cir. 1966); <i>Atlantic Coast Line R.R. Co. v. Kines</i>, 160 So. 2d 869 (Ala. 1963); <i>Vanlandingham</i> v. <i>Gartman</i>, 367 S.W.2d 111 (Ark. 1963); <i>Newbury v. Vogel</i>, 379 P.2d 811 (Colo. 1963); <i>Evening Star Newspaper Co. v. Gray</i>, 179 A.2d 377 (D.C. Mun. Ct. App. 1962); <i>Ratner v. Arrington</i> 111 So. 2d 82 (Fla. App. 1959); <i>Southern Indiana Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Bone</i>, 180 N.E.2d 375 (Ind. App. 1962; <i>Grossnickle v. Village of Germantown</i> 209 N.E.2d 442 (Oh. 1965); and <i>Hernandez v. Baucum</i>, 344 S.W.2d 498 (Tex. Civ. App. 1961).</p>
<p id="65fb8cec-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 11 jurisdictions the argument is not permitted. [<i>See e.g.</i>,] <i>Henne v. Balick</i>, 146 A.2d 394 (Del. 1958); <i>Franco v. Fujimoto</i>, 390 P.2d 740 (Haw. 1964); <i>Caley v. Manicke</i>, 182 N.E.2d 206 (Ill. 1962); <i>Botta v. Brunner</i>, 138 A.2d 713 (N.J. 1958); and <i>Caylor v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co</i>., 374 P.2d 53 (Kan. 1962).</p>
<p id="65fb8ced-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The conflict has also been thoroughly debated in the law reviews. An examination of a large number of articles on the subject indicates that a substantial majority of the authors are of the view that it is desirable to permit “per diem” argument.</p>
<span title="572" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-572">p. 572</span>
<p id="65fb8cee-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We believe the reasons hereinafter discussed persuasively require California to align itself with the majority of jurisdictions on this issue.</p>
<p id="65fb8cef-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The opening guns in the battle to prohibit an attorney from arguing damages on a “per diem” basis were sounded in <i>Botta v. Brunner</i> and every decision since <i>Botta</i> holding such argument to be improper has followed, at least in part, the reasoning employed in that case. In <i>Botta</i> the Supreme Court of New Jersey upheld the trial court’s refusal to permit plaintiff’s attorney to suggest that his client’s damages for pain and suffering be measured by a stated number of dollars for each day, essentially on the rationale that such statements of counsel are not evidence and have no foundation in the evidence, but in the minds of jurors they substitute “unproven, speculative and fanciful standards of evaluation for evidence.”</p>
<p id="65fb8cf0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not find the reasoning of <i>Botta</i> convincing. It is, of course, axiomatic that pain and suffering are difficult to measure in monetary terms. Yet the inescapable fact is that this is precisely what the jury is called upon to do. As one critic of <i>Botta</i> has noted: “The plaintiff sues for money. The defendant defends against an award of money. The jury is limited to expressing its findings in terms of money. Nevertheless, the jury must be precluded from hearing any reference whatever to money. It must retire to the jury room <i>in vacuo</i> on this essential of the case where the unmentionable and magical conversion from broken bones to hard cash may then take place.” 12 Rutgers L. Rev. 522 (1958).</p>

<p id="65fbdb21-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is undeniable that the argument of counsel does not constitute evidence. However, it does not follow, as averred in <i>Botta</i>, that the suggestion of a sum for damages can have no foundation in the evidence. Indeed it is necessarily inferred from observation of the plaintiff in the courtroom and from expert testimony regarding the nature of his injuries and their consequences. If the jury must infer from what it sees and hears at the trial that a certain amount of money is warranted as compensation for the plaintiff’s pain and suffering, there is no justification for prohibiting counsel from making a similar deduction in argument. An attorney is permitted to discuss all reasonable inferences from the evidence. It would be paradoxical to hold that damages in totality are inferable from the evidence but that when this sum is divided into segments representing days, months or years, the inference vanishes.</p>
<p id="65fbdb22-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, an attorney who suggests that his client’s damages for pain and suffering be calculated on a “per diem” basis is not presenting evidence to the jury but is merely drawing an inference from the <span title="573" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-573">p. 573</span>evidence given at the trial. Of course, the trial court has the power and duty to contain argument within legitimate bounds and it may prevent the attorney from drawing inferences not warranted by the evidence. For example, counsel should not be permitted to argue future damages for pain and suffering on a “per diem” basis where the evidence would not justify an inference that the plaintiff will suffer pain in the future.</p>
<p id="65fbdb23-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another dubious aspect of <i>Botta</i> is its conclusion that an attorney who employs the “per diem” argument invades the province of the jury. It seems patently clear that an attorney does not interfere with a jury’s decision-making powers to any greater extent when he suggests that damages be measured on a segmented basis than when he exhorts the jury to find the defendant negligent. It has never been contended that the jury forsakes its duty of determining whether the defendant acted as a reasonable man because counsel is permitted to discuss the participants’ conduct and the inferences to be drawn therefrom.</p>
<p id="65fbdb24-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many of the authorities, including <i>Botta</i>, point out that it is logically inconsistent to permit counsel to inform the jury of the lump sum amount claimed by the plaintiff or to suggest that a certain sum be awarded, while shielding the jury from the suggestion that the total amount may be fragmented to represent periods of time. These cases reason that discussion of a “per diem” amount involves no more speculation than a total figure. Indeed, in a Nevada case the court stated that, while it found the reasoning of <i>Botta</i> very persuasive, it felt compelled to allow “per diem” argument because of the practice in Nevada of telling the jury the total amount of damages sought by the plaintiff. <i>Johnson v. Brown</i>, 345 P.2d 754, 759 (Nev. 1959). Moreover, the jury itself may calculate the segmented amount of a verdict which it has under discussion from the figures available since, in addition to the lump sum amount sought, it is customarily told the life expectancy of the plaintiff where it is claimed there will be future detriment.</p>
<p id="65fbdb25-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some legal scholars indicate the actual subjective basis for decisions which hold the “per diem” argument improper is the belief such argument results in excessive verdicts and that courts which prohibit the “per diem” argument demonstrate a lack of confidence in the jury system. Even if it can be established that larger verdicts result on occasions when the “per diem” argument is employed, it does not necessarily follow that these awards are excessive under the circumstances of the particular cases since, as pointed out hereinafter, both the trial and the appellate courts have the power and the duty to reduce verdicts which are unreasonably large. As was stated in one case, “if the evil feared is excessive verdicts, then the cure ought to be directed against the product, not the practice.” <i>Johnson v. Colglazier</i> (1965) 348 F.2d 420, 425, 429 (dissenting opinion; the majority opinion in <i>Johnson</i> was overruled in <i>Baron Tube Co. v. Transport Ins. Co</i>., 365 F.2d 858 (5th Cir. 1966)).</p>
<p id="65fbdb26-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some of the cases which cite the danger of excessive damages as a basis for disapproving the “per diem” argument point to a Florida case (<i>Braddock v. Seaboard Airline R.R. Co</i>., 80 So. 2d 662 (Fla. 1955)) in which “per diem” damages were argued and the jury returned a verdict of $248,439, the exact amount <span title="574" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-574">p. 574</span>requested by plaintiff’s counsel. But even where the amount awarded is identical to the sum suggested, the verdict is not excessive as a matter of law. The circumstances may indicate the prescience of the attorney or his accurate evaluation of the case.</p>
<p id="65fbdb27-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other objections made to the use of a mathematical formula are that it produces an illusion of certainty which appeals to the jury but can only mislead it and that it can result in grossly magnifying the total damages by shrewd manipulation of the unit of time employed. In <i>Affett v. Milwaukee &amp; Suburban Transport Corp</i>. (1960) <i>supra</i>, 106 N.W.2d 274, 280, it is said that the absurdity of using a mathematical formula is demonstrated by the fact that an attorney could, instead of using a day as the unit of time for measurement, ask the jury to calculate his client’s pain and suffering in terms of seconds. Thus, one cent for each second of pain may not seem unreasonable, but if the damages were to be calculated on this basis it would result in $86.40 for a 24-hour day, $31,536 for each year, and an absurdly high figure <i>in toto</i>.</p>
<p id="65fbdb28-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are at least two answers to the foregoing objections. First, whatever manner of calculation is proposed by counsel or employed by the jury, the verdict must meet the test of reasonableness. The “per diem” argument is only a suggestion as to one method of reaching the goal of reasonableness, not a substitute for it. If the jury’s award does not meet this test, the trial court has the duty to reduce it, and the appellate court has the authority to review the result. To be sure, the standard of reasonableness permits the jury a wide latitude of discretion, but there is no convincing assurance that the accuracy of its evaluation would be enhanced by prohibiting counsel from suggesting that the plaintiff’s compensation for pain and suffering be measured in aggregates of short periods of time rather than by a total sum award for a longer period.</p>
<p id="65fbdb29-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, there exist meaningful safeguards to prevent the jury from being misled. As expected of him by his client, plaintiff’s attorney will urge the jury to award the maximum amount of damages which the evidence plausibly justifies, but he has the best of reasons for refraining from grossly exaggerating his claim since, by doing so, he may so tax the credulity of the jury that it will disregard his entire argument. If he overstates his claim by the device described in <i>Affett</i>, there is nothing to prevent defense counsel from pointing out this stratagem or to argue that the amount suggested is excessive and emphasize that the jury’s duty is to award only a reasonable sum as compensation. More important, the trial court can and should instruct the jury that the argument of counsel as to the amount of damages claimed by the plaintiff is not evidence and that its duty is only to award such damages as will reasonably compensate the plaintiff for his pain and suffering. The court may also, if it deems appropriate, advise the jury it is not bound by any particular method of calculation in assessing damages for pain and suffering.</p>
<p id="65fbdb2a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Every case which has considered the issue before us has emphasized the difficulty faced by a jury in attempting to measure in monetary terms compensation for injuries as subjective as pain, humiliation and embarrassment. The cases abound in broad statements such as that the matter is entrusted to the <span title="575" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-575">p. 575</span>“impartial conscience and judgment of jurors who may be expected to act reasonably, intelligently and in harmony with the evidence,” and that they are to award “fair and reasonable compensation” and be guided by “their observation, experience and sense of fairness and right.” These homilies provide little assistance to the jury. Under some circumstances, the concept of pain and suffering may become more meaningful when it is measured in short periods of time than over a span of many years, perhaps into infinity. The “worth” of pain over a period of decades is often more difficult to grasp as a concept of reality than is the same experience limited to a day, a week or a month. It is this very consideration which underlies much of the controversy over the issue before us. The fact that the “per diem” argument provides a more explicit comprehension and humanization of the plaintiff’s predicament to lay jurors makes this approach an effective tool in the hands of his attorney. This alone is not, however, a sufficient reason to condemn it.</p>
<p id="65fbdb2b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We pause to note that the “per diem” device is not beneficial exclusively to plaintiffs seeking damages. It is a double-edged sword with equal availability and utility in argument by defendant’s counsel who may employ the technique of dividing plaintiff’s total demand into time segments in order to illustrate how exaggerated or ludicrous the claim may be.</p>
<p id="65fbdb2c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Denial of the “per diem” argument deprives counsel of the full fruits of effective advocacy on the issue of damages, which is not infrequently the crucial conflict in the trial of an action for personal injuries. Only the most persuasive reasons justify handcuffing attorneys in the exercise of their advocacy within the bounds of propriety. We do not find them here.</p>
<p id="65fbdb2d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant and amici curiae urge that even if we do not adhere to the <i>Botta</i> prohibitory rule, we should hold that the “per diem” argument is not available as a matter of right but, rather, the entire question should be subject to the discretion of the trial court. We believe this would be an undesirable solution, creating more problems than it would solve. The inevitable results would be peremptory challenges to judges on the basis of whether or not they were inclined to permit argument on a mathematical basis, and the proliferation of appeals on the complex question of whether the court’s discretion was abused in a particular case. Existing rules relating to the trial court’s control over the scope of counsel’s argument are sufficient to protect the integrity of the jury’s decision-making role. There is no justification for holding that the “per diem” argument is governed by special standards not applicable to other types of argument.</p>
<p id="65fc023e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We come, finally, to the question whether the trial court’s error in limiting counsel’s argument in the present case resulted in prejudice. Plaintiff, a carpenter by trade, was 39 years old at the time of the accident. He was hospitalized for 12 days. He suffered cuts on his head and hands, a sliver of wood became lodged under his eyelid, and one of his front teeth was chipped in the mishap. Subsequently, his vision became impaired. He had not worn eyeglasses prior to the accident but was required to obtain a pair shortly thereafter, and a <span title="576" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-576">p. 576</span>few weeks after receiving the first pair of glasses he suffered another change in his vision, requiring a different prescription for his eyeglasses.</p>
<p id="65fc023f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff did not have any pains in his back before the accident, but subsequent thereto he had severe back pains which radiated down his thighs to the knees. He was required to wear a back brace and had been unable to work in his trade as a carpenter since the accident. A medical doctor testified that plaintiff was suffering from a congenital back defect known as spondylolisthesis and, although there is some conflict in the evidence on the issue, the expert testimony strongly indicates that this condition became symptomatic as a result of the accident. The doctor also testified that an operation costing $2,000 would be necessary in order to relieve plaintiff’s condition. After an examination of the entire record, we are compelled to conclude that it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to plaintiff would have been reached if the trial court had not limited counsel’s argument on the question of damages for pain and suffering.</p>
<p id="65fc0240-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When prejudicial error appears in the determination of the issue of damages, “It has been held that on an appeal from a judgment where the evidence as to liability is ‘overwhelming’ a retrial may be limited to the issue of damages. Where, however, the evidence as to liability is in sharp and substantial conflict, and the damages awarded are so grossly inadequate as to indicate a compromise on the issues of liability and damages, the case should be remanded for a retrial of both issues.” <i>Clifford</i>v. <i>Ruocco</i>, 246 P.2d 651 (Cal. 1952).</p>
<p id="65fc0241-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judgment is reversed.</p>

<p id="65fc0244-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>The Per Diem Debate.</i></b> Though the majority of courts permit <i>per diem</i> arguments, many such courts expect the trial judge to remind the jurors that they are hearing mere arguments of counsel and that they get to decide what the facts are in the case. Nevertheless, this admonition from the judge does little to offer solace to defense counsel, who generally do not want the jury thinking in per diem terms. Why is it that defendants are so opposed to the per diem argument, given that it could be used by either side to suggest a possible award (large or small)? Which objections to this type of jury argument discussed in <i>Beagle</i> seemed the most persuasive?</p>
<p id="65fc0245-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Golden Rule Arguments.</i></b> What if, in addition to the hypothetical closing argument set forth just before <i>Beagle</i>, plaintiff’s counsel also said something such as: “Now when I suggest the sum of $5 per hour for this pain you may think that’s quite a large figure. You would likely not feel this way if it were you experiencing an hour of my client’s pain. Would you take on a lifetime of the <span title="577" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-577">p. 577</span>pain and suffering my client is expected to have for a measly $5 per hour?” In another portion of the opinion, the court contrasted its ruling on per diem arguments with prohibited golden rule arguments:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65fc0246-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In holding that counsel may properly suggest to the jury that plaintiff’s pain and suffering be measured on a “per diem” basis, we do not imply that we also approve the so-called “golden rule” argument, by which counsel asks the jurors to place themselves in the plaintiff’s shoes and to award such damages as they would “charge” to undergo equivalent pain and suffering. <i>Id</i>. at 182 n.11.</p></div>
<p id="65fc0247-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The overwhelming judicial sentiment regarding golden rule arguments is that they improperly attempt to shift the focal point from the actual victim to the jurors in assessing damages. The ultimate prejudice with golden rule arguments is that they appeal to the sentiment alluded to by Justice Traynor in the quote at the beginning of this section on general damages—that no sane person would voluntarily take on a serious injury in exchange for even a room full of gold. To use such a device to ask the jury to award a room full of gold is universally condemned.</p>
<p id="65fc0248-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Problem.</i></b> Does the following jury argument from a plaintiff’s lawyer seem appropriate in light of the above concerns with per diem and golden rule arguments? Are these types of arguments effective in your opinion? As a defense counsel, how might you counter such an argument?</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65fc0249-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is extensive evidence in this case that my client suffered a tremendous injury to her left knee, which has, and almost certainly will in the future, impair her ability to walk, jog, or even get around the house very easily. When she puts weight on her leg, the doctors have found that she experiences a sharp pain that begins in her knee, extends up her leg, and culminates in a burning sensation in her lower back. This isn’t just pain she must tolerate every once in awhile. It’s pain she feels with each and every step she takes. She has no choice but to live with this pain. But that is no life that you or I would ever choose to live for any amount of money. How much will it take to compensate her fully for this pain and limitation on her daily life? That’s for you to decide. But as you make this decision, I would ask you what it’s worth in terms of dollars and cents, for each and every step she must take not only this afternoon, and tomorrow, but next month, next year, and nearly every moment of every day for the rest of her life on this earth. I would urge you to calculate for each step what the proper compensation should be and then to consider how many steps each of us takes on a daily basis, multiplying that amount by 365 for the number of days in a year, and then multiplying that amount by the estimated 35 years my client is expected to live after this trial. My client and I will accept your judgment as to that amount, whatever your calculations yield.</p>

<p id="65fc2968-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On February 11, 2002, plaintiff Vincent Donnellan’s cargo van was rear-ended by a school bus driven by an employee of defendant First Student, Inc. Plaintiff, 31 years old on the date of the accident, had no adverse health issues at the time. Plaintiff alleged in his complaint that, as a result of the accident, he suffered numerous permanent physical and mental injuries. Defendant conceded its negligence in the accident, but disputed that the accident was the proximate cause of plaintiff’s alleged injuries.</p>
<p id="65fc2969-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On April 7, 2006, following several days of trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff for $6 million. Defendant seeks reversal of the jury verdict or, alternatively, reversal of the damages award and remand for new trial on damages or substantial remittitur. Defendant argues that the trial court abused its discretion and committed prejudicial error in allowing plaintiff’s day-in-the-life video as demonstrative evidence. For the following reasons, we affirm the verdict of the jury.</p>
<p id="65fc296a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On September 11, 2002, plaintiff filed a complaint against defendant and Earl F. McClendon for injuries allegedly suffered due to defendant’s negligence <span title="579" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-579">p. 579</span>in the February 11, 2002, accident. At the time, McClendon was defendant’s employee and driving the school bus that rear-ended plaintiff. Prior to trial, McClendon was voluntarily dismissed and defendant admitted negligence.</p>
<p id="65fc296b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prior to the commencement of trial on the issues of causation and damages, the trial court heard the parties’ motions <i>in limine.</i> At issue on appeal [is the trial court’s decision] regarding plaintiff’s day-in-the-life video.</p>
<p id="65fc507c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The parties and the trial court watched the day-in-the-life video that the trial court described as a 4.5-minute video of plaintiff arriving at his therapist’s office and going through physical therapy. Defendant argued that the video was not demonstrative, but substantive medical evidence, and that the audio and video depicted plaintiff in pain during his therapy session. Defendant claimed that it was at a disadvantage from the late disclosure as it could not depose the therapist or videographer before trial. The trial court found that, with the proper foundation from someone with personal knowledge that the video truly and accurately depicts what it shows, the video would be allowed as demonstrative evidence without audio. The trial court further granted defendant the right to depose the physical therapist in the video.</p>
<p id="65fc507d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff testified that [at the scene of the accident] he was dizzy and had a headache, but he refused treatment at the scene of the accident. A friend drove him home, where he went to bed. Later that day, plaintiff felt great pain and continued to have a headache so he went to the emergency room. Plaintiff was diagnosed with a cervical strain. Two days later, plaintiff returned to the emergency room due to pain in the lower back and neck.</p>
<p id="65fc507e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff testified to the years of consultations, treatments, and physical therapy he had received, and continued to receive, to treat his headaches and pain and sleep and vision problems and to work on regaining mobility. Plaintiff takes several medications but could not recall which types. For a period of time, plaintiff received painful steroid shots in the base of his neck to treat his headaches. While these treatments seemed to work, they were discontinued as plaintiff began to feel pain beyond the treatment time in the area that he received the shots. Plaintiff also continued to receive Botox treatments to try and strengthen his leg.</p>
<p id="65fc507f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff testified to his typical day and week. On Monday and Thursday, plaintiff attends therapy. On the other days of the week, plaintiff works for his friend Gavin Nicholas, as his health allows. Plaintiff works in a supervisory capacity at construction sites, assuring that the laborers, tradesmen and contractors are coordinated. After the accident, plaintiff obtained his commercial driver’s license on his fourth attempt. While he still drives his car short distances, plaintiff can no longer drive trucks or operate heavy machinery. Plaintiff testified that he often has to close one eye and tilt his head to see properly when driving.</p>
<p id="65fc5080-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff’s wife, Rosanne Donnellan, a pediatrician, testified that she and plaintiff were engaged on December 24, 2001, and married on May 25, 2002, and that she was pregnant with their first child. Rosanne testified that she first noticed plaintiff’s leg starting to turn in a few months after the accident <span title="580" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-580">p. 580</span>until it eventually was turned in at all times. Rosanne stated that plaintiff had regular headaches, back spasms, vomiting due to pain, and sleep problems. In addition, plaintiff complained of double vision and, as a result, he no longer reads for enjoyment.</p>
<p id="65fc5081-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rosanne testified that plaintiff suffers serious memory lapses. She testified that she was worried that this was a danger to plaintiff and their household. Rosanne also testified that plaintiff’s problems have resulted in a drastic decrease in the couple’s attendance at social functions because plaintiff does not want to suffer pain or people looking at him.</p>
<p id="65fc5082-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dr. Gary M. Yarkony, board certified in physical medicine and rehabilitation since 1982, first saw plaintiff on July 12, 2002. Plaintiff complained of neck and back pain when he visited Yarkony. Yarkony suspected that plaintiff was suffering from a brain injury, including a cranial nerve injury that was causing a problem with plaintiff’s eye muscle. Yarkony stated that this type of injury is typically associated with traumatic brain damage and he ordered an MRI of plaintiff’s brain. Yarkony testified that the MRI did not demonstrate any issues and he utilized the later SPECT scan, which identified a brain injury, in his diagnosis. Yarkony also noted that he first observed plaintiff walking with an unusual gait on July 16, 2003, during his visit. Using a “little rehab doctor trick,” he observed plaintiff walking in the parking lot as he left the examination to assure it was not an act.</p>
<p id="65fc5083-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yarkony testified that plaintiff suffered a <i>coup contre coup</i> injury, meaning an injury to the brain at the site of impact, the back of plaintiff’s brain, and the opposite side, the front of his brain. In addition, Yarkony diagnosed plaintiff with fourth nerve palsy, dystonia, myofascial pain, allodynia, occipital neuralgia, and depression. The result of these ailments are hypersensitivity to pain, cognitive dysfunctions, double vision, headaches, sleeping and mood problems and decreased ability to walk. Yarkony opined that plaintiff’s symptoms will all naturally worsen as plaintiff ages and his body deteriorates.</p>
<p id="65fc5084-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The jury returned a verdict of $6 million for the plaintiff, including] $82,500 for the stipulated past medical expenses, $3,417,500 for disability experienced and expected in the future, $500,000 for disfigurement, and $2 million for past and future pain and suffering. The trial court denied defendant’s posttrial motion and this appeal followed.</p>
<p id="65fc5085-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant first argues that the trial court erred in admitting plaintiff’s physical therapy video as demonstrative evidence. Defendant asserts that the video was not timely disclosed, an insufficient foundation was laid, and it improperly focused on plaintiff’s discomfort to elicit sympathy from the jury. Defendant argues that the failure to bar the video…resulted in reversible error. We review a trial court’s admission of a day-in-the-life video for an abuse of discretion, which occurs only when no reasonable person would agree with the decision of the trial court.</p>
<p id="65fc5086-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff’s video, shot on March 17, 2006, is approximately five minutes long and contains footage of plaintiff exiting his car, walking into the rehabilitation center, and undergoing therapy on his leg and foot. Plaintiff produced the video <span title="581" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-581">p. 581</span>to defense counsel on March 29, 2006, the day before trial proceedings began. Defendant argues that because the video was not disclosed until such a late date, in addition to the failure to disclose the physical therapist as a trial witness, it was deprived of any opportunity to challenge the evidence.</p>
<p id="65fc5087-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant continues to argue that plaintiff’s video was not a day-in-the-life video as it did not simply demonstrate plaintiff’s daily tasks and functions. <i>Velarde</i>, 354 Ill. App. 3d at 535. Defendant points to several instances in the video where plaintiff grimaces and presents expressions of pain while his foot is manipulated by the therapist.</p>
<p id="65fc5088-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant points out that this case is unlike <i>Georgacopoulos v. University of Chicago Hospitals &amp; Clinics</i>, 504 N.E.2d 830 (Ill. App. 1987). In <i>Georgacopoulos</i>, this court affirmed the admission of a day-in-the-life video that included a portion where the plaintiff undergoes a painful physical therapy session. The court noted that the therapy session was only a portion of the 19-minute video and that the trial court described the tape as “‘tasteful.’” The court further distinguished that case from a federal case that found a day-in-the-life video more prejudicial than probative because it only showed a physical therapy session of the plaintiff that had suffered severe burns. <i>Thomas v. C.G. Tate Construction Co.</i>, 465 F. Supp. 566, 569 (D.S.C. 1979). Defendant argues that, as in the <i>Thomas</i> case, plaintiff’s video was only of his physical therapy session and the display of pain by plaintiff was therefore more prejudicial than probative.</p>
<p id="65fc5089-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff asserts that the trial court properly rejected defendant’s argument that the video was more documentation of a medical examination than demonstrative day-in-the-life evidence. Plaintiff notes that our courts have stated that day-in-the-life videos constitute demonstrative evidence which helps jurors understand witness testimony. <i>Cisarik v. Palos Community Hospital</i>, 579 N.E.2d 873 (Ill. App. 1991). Plaintiff contends that defendant’s argument rests on the inaccurate claim that the video so focused on plaintiff’s pain and effort that it was prejudicial as the video distinguished by <i>Georgacopoulos.</i></p>
<p id="65fc508a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff concludes that a proper foundation was laid by Rosanne, who testified that she had attended two physical therapy sessions in the past. She testified that the video accurately depicted how plaintiff exits his car, how he walks, and how his physical therapy is administered. Plaintiff argues that this is all that is required by <i>Spyrka</i> and <i>Cryns</i> to properly lay a foundation for demonstrative video evidence.</p>
<p id="65fc508b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, we agree that <i>Velarde</i> provides that day-in-the-life videos are demonstrative and not substantive videos. In addition, the very purpose of these videos is to illustrate evidence regarding a party’s life at the time of trial. Accordingly, the disclosure prior to trial was not prejudicial. As succinctly outlined in <i>Cisarik</i>, a day-in-the-life video is akin to a photograph and admissible if a foundation is laid by someone having personal knowledge of the filmed object and that the video is an accurate portrayal of that. The video’s probative value also must not be substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice.</p>
<p id="65fc508c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rosanne certainly knew plaintiff and could testify to his ability to drive, get out of a car and how he walked. She testified that she had attended plaintiff’s <span title="582" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-582">p. 582</span>sessions with the physical therapist twice and that the video was an accurate depiction of plaintiff and his therapy session. As with a photograph, Rosanne had personal knowledge of the contents of the video and the trial court properly accepted this as a foundation.</p>
<p id="65fc769d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court also found the danger of any prejudice did not outweigh its probative value. The video in this case is unlike those in <i>Spyrka</i> and <i>French.</i> In <i>Spyrka</i>, the video that was found to be prejudicial was a step-by-step animation of what happened to the plaintiff, not a general demonstrative exhibit to understand the medical condition suffered. Furthermore, the testifying doctor stated that he could not say the video accurately represented what happened to the plaintiff. Likewise, in <i>French</i>, the video in question purported to familiarize the jury with the scene of an accident that occurred at night. The video, however was filmed in the day and in a fashion that mirrored the alleged chain of events in the case. Accordingly, in both cases, the videos were prejudicial because they preconditioned the minds of the jury to accept the plaintiffs’ theories in each case.</p>
<p id="65fc769e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As in <i>Georgacopoulos</i>, the video in this case was “tastefully” produced. The video was not produced to improperly precondition the jury on plaintiff’s theory. Having viewed the video, it does not present a focus on plaintiff’s pain and discomfort to the exclusion of anything else. While plaintiff does wince and/or grimace in different spots in the video, he also smiles and talks with the therapist. There is no undue focus on his pain, it simply focuses on a typical therapy session that the evidence at trial indicated would be required for the rest of plaintiff’s life.</p>
<p id="65fc769f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, defendant contends that the jury award of $6 million was excessive and should be reversed with remand for further proceedings on that issue or a substantial remittitur must be entered. The question of damages is specifically reserved for the trier of fact, and we will not substitute our judgment lightly. We may reverse or modify a damages award as excessive only if it is unfair and unreasonable, if it results from passion or prejudice, or it is so excessively large that it shocks the conscience.</p>
<p id="65fc76a0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant argues that the jury’s award is radically disproportionate to the economic loss such that the award bears no relationship to plaintiff’s losses. Defendant notes that the noneconomic loss determined by the jury was over 70 times greater than the economic loss of the stipulated medical bills. Defendant argues that this fact alone makes the verdict shocking and excessive as a matter of law.</p>
<p id="65fc76a1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff responds by highlighting the great discretion granted to the jury in setting the amount of a verdict. Plaintiff notes that <i>Velarde</i> also cites several factors that may be used in reviewing compensatory damages, including the permanency of the condition, the possibility of future deterioration, the extent of medical expenses, and the restrictions imposed due to the injuries suffered. Plaintiff also argues that Illinois does not require any particular ratio of economic loss to non-economic loss and that the evidence presented at trial supported the jury’s award.</p>
<span title="583" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-583">p. 583</span>
<p id="65fc76a2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While a damage award for noneconomic damages such as those suffered by plaintiff is subject to even less precision than economic damages or lost wages, it still must be a product of the evidence and not passion such that it is shockingly excessive. As defendant indicated, a “plethora of medical evidence,” was presented at trial. That evidence indicated plaintiff’s life will be negatively affected for the remainder of his life, with a life expectancy of more than 40 years.</p>
<p id="65fc76a3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While it is true that plaintiff has retained a certain amount of ability to function since the accident as defendant enumerates, the evidence also showed that each of those activities listed by defendant is limited by plaintiff’s lost mobility, increased pain, and depression. Furthermore, testimony was given indicating that, as plaintiff aged and his body deteriorated, his symptoms would likely worsen. While $6 million is a large sum, it is by no means so large as to shock the conscience as compensation for the lifetime of consequences that plaintiff and his family face due to the physical and mental limitations posed by his injuries.</p>
<p id="65fc76a4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, for the aforementioned reasons, the decision of the trial court is affirmed.</p>

<p id="65fc76a7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>The Evidentiary Debate.</i></b> The Federal Rules of Evidence (which also provide a model for most states’ evidentiary rules as well) generally provide that evidence that is “relevant” is admissible (Rule 401) so long as it is not unduly “prejudicial” (Rule 403). Though most courts are willing to consider the admission into evidence of a day-in-the-life video as relevant evidence of a plaintiff’s pain and suffering as well as of a plaintiff’s physical limitations from a disability, courts frequently have to consider whether the evidence is too prejudicial and panders to the jury’s emotions. In the above case, the court found that the video’s depiction of the plaintiff was tastefully done and supported by appropriate evidence.</p>
<p id="65fc76a8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Problem.</i></b> Imagine that you are plaintiff’s counsel for a client who suffered a serious spinal cord injury resulting in paralysis below the shoulders. With the admonition from the <i>Donnellan</i> court in mind—that a video depicting your client’s daily life and limitations must be accurate, tasteful, and without “undue focus on his pain”—consider what aspects of your client’s daily life would be suitable to show to a jury in order to demonstrate the seriousness of his condition. Which specific portions of his daily life might you seek to include in the video? How long is an appropriate length for the video depiction, considering that you want the jury to award appropriately high damages without offending the jury? Which aspects that you might want to depict would be most objectionable to defense counsel?</p>

<p id="65fc9dbc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Beginning in the 1980s, plaintiffs’ counsel, concerned that the existing categories of general damages (e.g., pain and suffering, disfigurement, impairment, mental anguish) might allow other harm to fall through the compensatory cracks, began advocating for recognition of another category of general damages—the lost enjoyment of life or <i>hedonic damages</i>. As you might imagine, defendants are not thrilled about adding yet another damage line to verdict forms and have resisted this urging from the plaintiffs’ bar. In the case below the court wrestles with whether it is fair to recognize this additional category of damages. It adopts the majority approach.</p>

<p id="65fcc4d5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This appeal raises fundamental questions about the nature and role of nonpecuniary damages in personal injury litigation. By nonpecuniary damages, we mean those damages awarded to compensate an injured person for the physical and emotional consequences of the injury, such as pain and suffering and the loss of the ability to engage in certain activities. Pecuniary damages, on the other hand, compensate the victim for the economic consequences of the injury, such as medical expenses, lost earnings and the cost of custodial care.</p>
<p id="65fcc4d6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The specific questions raised here deal with the assessment of nonpecuniary damages and are (1) whether some degree of cognitive awareness is a prerequisite to recovery for loss of enjoyment of life and (2) whether a jury should be instructed to consider and award damages for loss of enjoyment of life separately from damages for pain and suffering. We answer the first question in the affirmative and the second question in the negative.</p>
<p id="65fcc4d7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On September 7, 1978, plaintiff Emma McDougald, then 31 years old, underwent a Caesarean section and tubal ligation at New York Infirmary. Defendant Garber performed the surgery; defendants Armengol and Kulkarni provided anesthesia. During the surgery, Mrs. McDougald suffered oxygen deprivation which resulted in severe brain damage and left her in a permanent comatose condition. This action was brought by Mrs. McDougald and her husband, suing derivatively, alleging that the injuries were caused by the defendants’ acts of malpractice.</p>
<p id="65fcc4d8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A jury found all defendants liable and awarded Emma McDougald a total of $9,650,102 in damages, including $1,000,000 for conscious pain and suffering and a separate award of $3,500,000 for loss of the pleasures and pursuits of life. The balance of the damages awarded to her were for pecuniary damages—lost <span title="585" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-585">p. 585</span>earnings and the cost of custodial and nursing care. Her husband was awarded $1,500,000 on his derivative claim for the loss of his wife’s services.</p>
<p id="65fcc4d9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[On appeal, the primary dispute] is the award to Emma McDougald for nonpecuniary damages. At trial, defendants sought to show that Mrs. McDougald’s injuries were so severe that she was incapable of either experiencing pain or appreciating her condition. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, introduced proof that Mrs. McDougald responded to certain stimuli to a sufficient extent to indicate that she was aware of her circumstances. Thus, the extent of Mrs. McDougald’s cognitive abilities, if any, was sharply disputed.</p>
<p id="65fcc4da-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The parties and the trial court agreed that Mrs. McDougald could not recover for pain and suffering unless she were conscious of the pain. Defendants maintained that such consciousness was also required to support an award for loss of enjoyment of life. The court, however, accepted plaintiffs’ view that loss of enjoyment of life was compensable without regard to whether the plaintiff was aware of the loss. Accordingly, because the level of Mrs. McDougald’s cognitive abilities was in dispute, the court instructed the jury to consider loss of enjoyment of life as an element of nonpecuniary damages separate from pain and suffering.</p>
<p id="65fcc4db-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that the court erred, both in instructing the jury that Mrs. McDougald’s awareness was irrelevant to their consideration of damages for loss of enjoyment of life and in directing the jury to consider that aspect of damages separately from pain and suffering.</p>
<p id="65fcc4dc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We begin with the familiar proposition that an award of damages to a person injured by the negligence of another is to compensate the victim, not to punish the wrongdoer. The goal is to restore the injured party, to the extent possible, to the position that would have been occupied had the wrong not occurred. To be sure, placing the burden of compensation on the negligent party also serves as a deterrent, but purely punitive damages—that is, those which have no compensatory purpose—are prohibited unless the harmful conduct is intentional, malicious, outrageous, or otherwise aggravated beyond mere negligence.</p>
<p id="65fcc4dd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Damages for nonpecuniary losses are, of course, among those that can be awarded as compensation to the victim. This aspect of damages, however, stands on less certain ground than does an award for pecuniary damages. An economic loss can be compensated in kind by an economic gain; but recovery for noneconomic losses such as pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life rests on “the legal fiction that money damages can compensate for a victim’s injury.” We accept this fiction, knowing that although money will neither ease the pain nor restore the victim’s abilities, this device is as close as the law can come in its effort to right the wrong. We have no hope of evaluating what has been lost, but a monetary award may provide a measure of solace for the condition created.</p>
<p id="65fcc4de-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our willingness to indulge this fiction comes to an end, however, when it ceases to serve the compensatory goals of tort recovery. When that limit is met, further indulgence can only result in assessing damages that are punitive. The <span title="586" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-586">p. 586</span>question posed by this case, then, is whether an award of damages for loss of enjoyment of life to a person whose injuries preclude any awareness of the loss serves a compensatory purpose. We conclude that it does not.</p>
<p id="65fcc4df-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Simply put, an award of money damages in such circumstances has no meaning or utility to the injured person. An award for the loss of enjoyment of life “cannot provide [such a victim] with any consolation or ease any burden resting on him. He cannot spend it upon necessities or pleasures. He cannot experience the pleasure of giving it away.” <i>Flannery v. United States</i>, 718 F.2d 108, 111, <i>cert denied</i> 467 U.S. 1226.</p>
<p id="65fcc4e0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We recognize that, as the trial court noted, requiring some cognitive awareness as a prerequisite to recovery for loss of enjoyment of life will result in some cases “in the paradoxical situation that the greater the degree of brain injury inflicted by a negligent defendant, the smaller the award the plaintiff can recover in general damages.” The force of this argument, however—the temptation to achieve a balance between injury and damages—has nothing to do with meaningful compensation for the victim. Instead, the temptation is rooted in a desire to punish the defendant in proportion to the harm inflicted. However relevant such retributive symmetry may be in the criminal law, it has no place in the law of civil damages, at least in the absence of culpability beyond mere negligence.</p>
<p id="65fcc4e1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, we conclude that cognitive awareness is a prerequisite to recovery for loss of enjoyment of life. With respect to pain and suffering, the trial court charged simply that there must be “some level of awareness” in order for plaintiff to recover. We think that this is an appropriate standard for all aspects of nonpecuniary loss. No doubt the standard ignores analytically relevant levels of cognition, but we resist the desire for analytical purity in favor of simplicity. A more complex instruction might give the appearance of greater precision but, given the limits of our understanding of the human mind, it would in reality lead only to greater speculation.</p>
<p id="65fcc4e2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We turn next to the question whether loss of enjoyment of life should be considered a category of damages separate from pain and suffering.</p>
<p id="65fcc4e3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no dispute here that the fact finder may, in assessing nonpecuniary damages, consider the effect of the injuries on the plaintiff’s capacity to lead a normal life. Traditionally, in this State and elsewhere, this aspect of suffering has not been treated as a separate category of damages; instead, the plaintiff’s inability to enjoy life to its fullest has been considered one type of suffering to be factored into a general award for nonpecuniary damages, commonly known as pain and suffering.</p>
<p id="65fcc4e4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recently, however, there has been an attempt to segregate the suffering associated with physical pain from the mental anguish that stems from the inability to engage in certain activities, and to have juries provide a separate award for each.</p>
<p id="65fcc4e5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not dispute that distinctions can be found or created between the concepts of pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life. If the term <span title="587" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-587">p. 587</span>“suffering” is limited to the emotional response to the sensation of pain, then the emotional response caused by the limitation of life’s activities may be considered qualitatively different. But suffering need not be so limited—it can easily encompass the frustration and anguish caused by the inability to participate in activities that once brought pleasure. Traditionally, by treating loss of enjoyment of life as a permissible factor in assessing pain and suffering, courts have given the term this broad meaning.</p>
<p id="65fcc4e6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If we are to depart from this traditional approach and approve a separate award for loss of enjoyment of life, it must be on the basis that such an approach will yield a more accurate evaluation of the compensation due to the plaintiff. We have no doubt that, in general, the total award for nonpecuniary damages would increase if we adopted the rule. That separate awards are advocated by plaintiffs and resisted by defendants is sufficient evidence that larger awards are at stake here. But a larger award does not by itself indicate that the goal of compensation has been better served.</p>

One scholarly article urges retrenchment on this trend for a number of reasons, but most notably because: “[a]mong the gravest risks hedonic damages pose is the risk of double counting.”</p>

<p id="65fcebfb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The advocates of separate awards contend that because pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life can be distinguished, they must be treated separately if the plaintiff is to be compensated fully for each distinct injury suffered. We disagree. Such an analytical approach may have its place when the subject is pecuniary damages, which can be calculated with some precision. But the estimation of nonpecuniary damages is not amenable to such analytical precision and may, in fact, suffer from its application. Translating human suffering into dollars and cents involves no mathematical formula; it rests, as we have said, on a legal fiction. The figure that emerges is unavoidably distorted by the translation. Application of this murky process to the component parts of nonpecuniary injuries (however analytically distinguishable they may be) cannot make it more accurate. If anything, the distortion will be amplified by repetition.</p>
<p id="65fcebfc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, we are not persuaded that any salutary purpose would be served by having the jury make separate awards for pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life. We are confident, furthermore, that the trial advocate’s art is a sufficient guarantee that none of the plaintiff’s losses will be ignored by the jury.</p>
<p id="65fcebfd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The errors in the instructions given to the jury require a new trial on the issue of nonpecuniary damages to be awarded to plaintiff Emma McDougald.

If this is the case, why does the court ultimately reject this category as a separate item of compensation?</p>

Some courts, however, permit a separate line on the verdict form for hedonic damages, but most consider loss of enjoyment to be a part of the broader recovery for pain and suffering. Yet other courts have held that such items are not recoverable under <i>any</i> category of recognized general damages.

<p id="65fcec05-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At common law the death of a victim was paradoxically a cause for celebration for the tortfeasor because the claims expired with the victim. That is, no cause of action survived the death of the victim. Ironically, this meant that it was cheaper for a defendant to kill a victim than just to injure him. This began to change in the first half of the nineteenth century by certain acts of legislatures. Today every state has enacted wrongful death statutes and survival statutes. A survival cause of action is owned by the estate of the decedent and provides for recovery for damages suffered by the decedent from the time of the tort until his death; such damages might include pain and suffering damages as well as medical expenses and lost wages. This claim survives for the benefit of the estate. A wrongful death cause of action provides for recovery by certain statutory beneficiaries (typically the immediate family) to compensate for their losses associated with the death of their loved one; that is, a wrongful death claim covers the harm to others beginning at the moment of the victim’s death. Exactly what forms of damages are recoverable, and who is entitled to bring suit, are ultimately governed by the terms of the applicable statute. Many wrongful <span title="589" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-589">p. 589</span>death statutes have been interpreted to provide for recovery of only “pecuniary” losses. What this means and whether a wrongful death beneficiary might be able to sue for an item of general damages has been the subject of many lawsuits, such as the following case.</p>

<p id="65fcec0c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We granted this appeal to determine whether spousal and parental consortium losses should be permissible in wrongful death actions. Tennessee law previously permitted the anomalous result of allowing spousal consortium losses in personal injury cases but not in cases of wrongful death. Upon review of the modern trend of authority and careful scrutiny of our statutory scheme, we hold that loss of consortium claims should not be limited to personal injury suits. We hold that the pecuniary value of a deceased’s life includes the element of damages commonly referred to as loss of consortium.</p>
<p id="65fd131d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This cause of action arises out of the death of Mary Sue Douglas (“decedent”). The plaintiff, Martha P. Jordan, is a surviving child of the decedent and the administratrix of the decedent’s estate. The plaintiff, on behalf of the decedent’s estate, filed a medical malpractice action against the defendants, Baptist Three Rivers Hospital, Mark W.

The defendants filed a motion to strike and a motion for judgment on the pleadings asserting that Tennessee law does not permit recovery for loss of parental consortium.</p>
<p id="65fd131f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court granted the defendants’ motion to strike and granted the plaintiff permission to file an interlocutory appeal. The Court of Appeals [denied the application for an interlocutory appeal].

<p id="65fd1320-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A wrongful death cause of action did not exist at common law. Pursuant to the common law, actions for personal injuries that resulted in death terminated at the victim’s death because “in a civil court the death of a human being could not be complained of as an injury.” W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts §127, at 945 (5th ed. 1984) (“Prosser”). “The [legal] result was that it was cheaper for the defendant to kill the plaintiff than to injure him, and that the most grievous of all injuries left the bereaved family of the victim…without a remedy.” Id. This rule of non-liability for wrongful death was <span title="590" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-590">p. 590</span>previously the prevailing view in both England and in the United States. <i>East Tennessee V. &amp; G. Ry. Co. v. Lilly</i>, 18 S.W. 243, 244 (Tenn. 1891).</p>
<p id="65fd1321-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1846, the British Parliament enacted a wrongful death statute designed to abrogate the common law rule’s harsh effect of denying recovery for personal injuries resulting in death. The English statute was referred to as “Lord Campbell’s Act” and created a cause of action for designated survivors that accrued upon the tort victim’s death.</p>
<p id="65fd1322-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Jurisdictions in the United States were quick to follow England’s lead. In 1847, New York became the first American jurisdiction to enact a wrongful death statute. Presently, every jurisdiction in the United States has a wrongful death statute. These statutes, including that of Tennessee, embody the substantive provisions of Lord Campbell’s Act and permit designated beneficiaries to recover losses sustained as a result of the tort victim’s death.</p>
<p id="65fd1323-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because a cause of action for wrongful death is a creation of statute, recoverable damages must be determined by reference to the particular statute involved. Although all states have abolished the rule of non-liability when personal injury results in death, the statutory methods of doing so fall into two distinct categories—wrongful death statutes and survival statutes.</p>
<p id="65fd1324-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority of states have enacted “survival statutes.” These statutes permit the victim’s cause of action to survive the death, so that the victim, through the victim’s estate, recovers damages that would have been recovered by the victim had the victim survived. Survival statutes do not create a new cause of action; rather, the cause of action vested in the victim at the time of death is transferred to the person designated in the statutory scheme to pursue it, and the action is enlarged to include damages for the death itself. Prosser, §126, at 942-43. “The recovery is the same one the decedent would have been entitled to at death, and thus included such items as wages lost after injury and before death, medical expenses incurred, and pain and suffering,” and other appropriate compensatory damages suffered by the victim from the time of injury to the time of death. Id. at 943.</p>
<p id="65fd1325-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In contrast to survival statutes, “pure wrongful death statutes” create a new cause of action in favor of the survivors of the victim for their loss occasioned by the death. These statutes proceed “on the theory of compensating the individual beneficiaries for the loss of the economic benefit which they might reasonably have expected to receive from the decedent in the form of support, services or contributions during the remainder of [the decedent’s] lifetime if [the decedent] had not been killed.” Prosser, §127, at 949. Hence, most wrongful death jurisdictions have adopted a “pecuniary loss” standard of recovery, allowing damages for economic contributions the deceased would have made to the survivors had death not occurred and for the economic value of the services the deceased would have rendered to the survivors but for the death.</p>
<p id="65fd1326-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Tennessee’s approach to providing a remedy for death resulting from personal injury is a hybrid between survival and wrongful death statutes, resulting in a statutory scheme with a “split personality.” 27 Tenn. L. Rev. at 454. The <span title="591" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-591">p. 591</span>pertinent damages statute, Tenn. Code Ann. §20-5-113, has been in existence in one form or another since 1883. It provides:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65fd1327-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where a person’s death is caused by the wrongful act, fault, or omission of another, and suit is brought for damages…the party suing shall, if entitled to damages, have the right to recover the mental and physical suffering, loss of time, and necessary expenses resulting to the deceased from the personal injuries, <b>and also the damages resulting to the parties for whose use and benefit the right of action survives from the death consequent upon the injuries received</b>.</p></div>
<p id="65fd1328-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Tenn. Code Ann. §20-5-113 (emphasis added).</p>
<p id="65fd1329-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plain language of Tenn. Code Ann. §20-5-113 reveals that it may be classified as a survival statute because it preserves whatever cause of action was vested in the victim at the time of death. The survival character of the statute is evidenced by the language “the party suing shall have the right to recover [damages] resulting to <b>the deceased from the personal injuries</b>.” <i>Thrailkill v. Patterson</i>, 879 S.W.2d 836, 841 (Tenn. 1994) (emphasis added). Tennessee courts have declared that the purpose of this language is to provide “for the continued existence and passing of the right of action of the deceased, and not for any new, independent cause of action in [survivors].” <i>Whaley v. Catlett</i>, 53 S.W. 131, 133 (Tenn. 1899); see also <i>Herrell v. Haney</i>, 341 S.W.2d 574, 576 (Tenn. 1960). Accordingly, Tenn. Code Ann. §20-5-113 “in theory, preserve[s] the right of action which the deceased himself would have had, and…[has] basically been construed as falling within the survival type of wrongful death statutes for over a century” because it continues that cause of action by permitting recovery of damages for the death itself. Jones, 539 S.W.2d at 123-25.</p>
<p id="65fd132a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notwithstanding the accurate, technical characterization of Tenn. Code Ann. §20-5-113 as survival legislation, the statute also creates a cause of action that compensates survivors for their losses. The statute provides that damages may be recovered “<b>resulting to the parties for whose use and benefit the right of action survives from the death</b>.” Id. (emphasis added). Hence, survivors of the deceased may recover damages for their losses suffered as a result of the death as well as damages sustained by the deceased from the time of injury to the time of death. Our inquiry shall focus on whether survivors should be permitted to recover consortium losses.</p>
<p id="65fd132b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant argues that this Court has previously held that Tenn. Code Ann. §20-5-113 is a survival statute and that survival statutes generally do not permit recovery under consortium theories. While this Court in <i>Jones v. Black</i>, 539 S.W.2d 123 (Tenn. 1976), previously classified Tennessee’s wrongful death statute as a survival statute for purposes of limitations of action, we are not confined to interpret the statute according to the strictures of a judicially imposed classification when such an interpretation would ignore unambiguous statutory language. Accordingly, our analysis of Tenn. Code Ann. §20-5-113 shall focus on the statute’s language and not on what damages “survival” statutes in other states generally permit. It must be remembered that, notwithstanding the <span title="592" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-592">p. 592</span>accurate, technical characterization of Tenn. Code Ann. §20-5-113 as survival legislation, the statute also provides for a cause of action that compensates survivors for <i>their</i> losses.</p>
<p id="65fd132c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Damages under our wrongful death statute can be delineated into two distinct classifications. The first classification permits recovery for injuries sustained by the deceased from the time of injury to the time of death. Damages under the first classification include medical expenses, physical and mental pain and suffering, funeral expenses, lost wages, and loss of earning capacity.</p>
<p id="65fd132d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second classification of damages permits recovery of incidental damages suffered by the decedent’s next of kin. Incidental damages have been judicially defined to <i>include</i> the pecuniary value of the decedent’s life. Pecuniary value has been judicially defined to include “the expectancy of life, the age, condition of health and strength, capacity for labor and earning money through skill, any art, trade, profession and occupation or business, and personal habits as to sobriety and industry.” Id. Pecuniary value also takes into account the decedent’s probable living expenses had the decedent lived. <i>Wallace v. Couch</i>, 642 S.W.2d 141 (Tenn. 1982).</p>
<p id="65fd132e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The wrongful death statute neither explicitly precludes consortium damages nor reflects an intention to preclude consortium damages. The statute’s language does not limit recovery to purely economic losses. To the contrary, the statute’s plain language appears to encompass consortium damages.</p>
<p id="65fd132f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Indeed, this Court has recognized that pecuniary value cannot be defined to a mathematical certainty as such a definition “would overlook the value of the [spouse’s] personal interest in the affairs of the home and the economy incident to [the spouse’s] services.” Thrailkill, 879 S.W.2d at 841. We further believe that the pecuniary value of a human life is a compound of many elements. An individual family member has value to others as part of a functioning social and economic unit. This value necessarily includes the value of mutual society and protection, i.e. human companionship. Human companionship has a definite, substantial and ascertainable pecuniary value, and its loss forms a part of the value of the life we seek to ascertain. Moreover, it seems illogical and absurd to believe that the legislature would intend the anomaly of permitting recovery of consortium losses when a spouse is injured and survives but not when the very same act causes a spouse’s death.</p>
<p id="65fd1330-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The wrongful death statute precludes neither a minor child nor an adult child from seeking compensation for the child’s consortium losses.</p>
<p id="65fd1331-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A review of case law in other jurisdictions indicates a trend to expand consortium claims to include the impairment of a child’s relationship with a parent. In cases involving a parent’s death, “the general rule…followed is that a child’s loss of nurture, education and moral training which it probably would have received from a parent wrongfully killed is a pecuniary loss to be considered as an element of the damages suffered by the child.” Recovery for Wrongful Death at §3:47 (listing thirty-four jurisdictions so holding). See also 94 Va. L. Rev. at 266 (“Most states…allow a surviving…child…to recover for loss of consortium where a parent is tortiously killed.”); Prosser, §127, at 952 (“Even <span title="593" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-593">p. 593</span>jurisdictions that have rejected the loss of society or consortium claim, as such, have permitted one form of it, namely a loss of guidance and advice that the decedent would have provided [to the child].”).</p>
<p id="65fd3a42-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A basis for placing an economic value on parental consortium is that the education and training which a child may reasonably expect to receive from a parent are of actual and commercial value to the child. Accordingly, a child sustains a pecuniary injury for the loss of parental education and training when a defendant tortiously causes the death of the child’s parent.</p>
<p id="65fd3a43-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The additional considerations employed for spousal consortium may be applicable to parental consortium claims. We agree with the observation of one court that “companionship, comfort, society, guidance, solace, and protection…go into the vase of family happiness [and] are the things for which a wrongdoer must pay when he shatters the vase.” <i>Spangler v. Helm’s New York-Pittsburgh Motor Exp.</i>, 153 A.2d 490 (Penn. 1959).</p>
<p id="65fd3a44-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Adult children may be too attenuated from their parents in some cases to proffer sufficient evidence of consortium losses. Similarly, if the deceased did not have a close relationship with any of the statutory beneficiaries, the statutory beneficiaries will not likely sustain compensable consortium losses or their consortium losses will be nominal. The age of the child does not, in and of itself, preclude consideration of parental consortium damages. The adult child inquiry shall take into consideration factors such as closeness of the relationship and dependence (i.e., of a handicapped adult child, assistance with day care, etc.).</p>
<p id="65fd3a45-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We hold that consortium-type damages may be considered when calculating the pecuniary value of a deceased’s life. This holding does not create a new cause of action but merely refines the term “pecuniary value.” Consortium losses are not limited to spousal claims but also necessarily encompass a child’s loss, whether minor or adult. Loss of consortium consists of several elements, encompassing not only tangible services provided by a family member, but also intangible benefits each family member receives from the continued existence of other family members. Such benefits include attention, guidance, care, protection, training, companionship, cooperation, affection, love, and in the case of a spouse, sexual relations. Our holding conforms with the plain language of the wrongful death statutes, the trend of modern authority, and the social and economic reality of modern society.</p>

<p id="65fd3a49-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Wrongful Death and Survival Statutes.</i></b> In <i>Jordan</i>, the court devotes time to distinguishing between wrongful death and survival statutes—these differences relate to (a) who owns the claim, (b) who is the “victim” who is the focal point in assessing damages, (c) the timing of when the recoverable damages are incurred, and (d) the types of damages recoverable. To a large <span title="594" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-594">p. 594</span>extent, the intricate answers to these questions are found in each state’s respective statutes. In general though, how did <i>Jordan</i> answer these questions? As between wrongful death and survival claims, do you believe one will tend to be of greater value than the other?</p>
<p id="65fd3a4a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2.  <i>Loss of Consortium Recovery.</i></b> The court in <i>McDougald</i> mentioned that the husband received a jury award of $1.5 million for loss of household services of his wife. Courts have traditionally permitted a spouse’s right to recover for the personal loss arising from the serious disability of a husband or wife. Typically referred to as <i>loss of consortium</i> damages, such recovery is intended to provide compensation for harms to the relationship as well as the loss of personal services provided by that spouse. In <i>Jordan</i>, the court confronted the issue of whether the state’s wrongful death statute permitted a loss of consortium claim and whether this should allow an adult child to recover for the wrongful death of a parent. Many courts now recognize such claims by one whose parent is killed. Courts have also recently recognized a loss of “filial” consortium claim for the parent of a deceased child. Most courts, however, refuse to extend loss of consortium claims to cover other relationships, such as grandparent-grandchild, siblings, friends, or even a fiancée.</p>
<p id="65fd3a4b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Derivative Nature of Claim.</i></b> Where a loss of consortium claim is recognized, it is <i>derivative</i> of the primary victim’s claim. This means that any defense the defendant may have to the primary victim’s claim also applies with equal force to the loss of consortium claim (including comparative fault or the primary victim’s assumption of the risk). If the primary victim is apportioned a level of fault, the owner of the derivative cause of action for loss of consortium is equally impacted by this apportionment (this could result in either a reduction or elimination of their claim, depending upon the type of comparative fault system and the levels of apportioned fault). Wrongful death claims are similarly derivative of the decedent’s survival cause of action and subject to the same affirmative defenses.</p>
<p id="65fd3a4c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Overlap Between Bystander Injury and Lost Consortium.</i></b> Previously in Chapter 6 on Special Duty Rules, we explored courts’ willingness to permit a claim, in <i>Dillon</i> jurisdictions, for the emotional distress of witnessing the death or serious injury of a loved one. In such a scenario, the family member witnessing the tragic accident would likely also have a loss of consortium claim if the victim were either a spouse or a parent/child of the witness. Significant potential overlap exists between one’s bystander claim for emotional anguish and the loss of consortium arising from the same accident. The difference between them is that the bystander claim remedies the harm from witnessing the event while the consortium claim arises from the ensuing negative impact on the relationship between the witness and victim. In the real world of a jury box, one wonders how easily a typical juror could maintain such distinction in assessing damages.</p>

<p id="65fd616a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where the defendant’s misconduct has caused property damage, a typical method of calculating this item of special damage is to use the difference between the market value of the property prior to the tort and after the tort. The reduction in the amount is the lost fair market value of the property. Of course, where the property is completely destroyed due to the defendant’s tort, the entire market value at the time of its destruction becomes recoverable. Market value is what the property could have been sold for on the open market in a voluntary sale to a willing buyer. Where the property is merely damaged and it is unclear how this damage has impacted the market value, courts often permit consideration of the costs of repair of the item as a substitute method for calculating the damage. Generally, costs of repair as an alternative calculation of damage should not exceed the actual market value of the unimpaired item. When the plaintiff cannot use the property for a significant period of time as a result of the defendant’s tort, courts will permit recovery of a reasonable rental cost as a way to determine the damages for the loss of use of the item. Each of these calculations of actual damage would be in the nature of special or <span title="596" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-596">p. 596</span>economic losses. As to these items of damage, little controversy exists in terms of the principles governing providing a remedy.</p>
<p id="65fd616b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While these damage models are relatively straightforward in tort cases involving harm to personal property, plaintiffs in some such cases have made creative attempts to recover for additional items of loss. The following recent case involving an injury to someone’s dog portrays such an attempt. As you read the opinion, consider the rationales behind courts’ reluctance to permit recovery of general damages for injury to most types of personal property.</p>

<p id="65fd6174-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Texans love their dogs. Throughout the Lone Star State, canine companions are treated—and treasured—not as mere personal property but as beloved friends and confidants, even family members. Given the richness that companion animals add to our everyday lives, losing “man’s best friend” is undoubtedly sorrowful. Even the gruffest among us tears up (every time) at the end of <i>Old Yeller</i>.</p>
<p id="65fd6175-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case concerns the types of damages available for the loss of a family pet. If a cherished dog is negligently killed, can a dollar value be placed on a heartsick owner’s heartfelt affection? More pointedly, may a bereaved dog owner recover emotion-based damages for the loss? In 1891, we effectively said no, announcing a “true rule” that categorized dogs as personal property, thus disallowing non-economic damages. In 2011, however, a court of appeals said yes, effectively creating a novel—and expansive—tort claim: loss of companionship for the wrongful death of a pet.</p>
<p id="65fd6176-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In today’s case, involving a family dog that was accidentally euthanized, we must decide whether to adhere to our restrictive, 122-year-old precedent classifying pets as property for tort-law purposes, or to instead recognize a new common-law loss-of-companionship claim that allows non-economic damages rooted solely in emotional attachment, a remedy the common law has denied those who suffer the wrongful death of a spouse, parent, or child,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10967_a395957d-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10967_a395957d-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d">5</a></span> and is available in Texas only by [the enactment of a wrongful death] statute.</p>

<p id="65fd6178-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We acknowledge the grief of those whose companions are negligently killed. Relational attachment is unquestionable. But it is also uncompensable. We reaffirm our long-settled rule, which tracks the overwhelming weight of authority nationally, plus the bulk of amicus curiae briefs from several pet-welfare organizations (who understand the deep emotional bonds between people and their animals): Pets are property in the eyes of the law, and we decline to permit non-economic damages rooted solely in an owner’s subjective feelings. True, a beloved companion dog is not a fungible, inanimate object like, say, a toaster. The term “property” is not a pejorative but a legal descriptor, and its use should not be misconstrued as discounting the emotional attachment that pet owners undeniably feel. Nevertheless, under established legal doctrine, recovery in pet-death cases is, barring legislative reclassification, limited to loss of value, not loss of relationship.</p>

<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="65fd617a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p></div>
<p id="65fd888b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In June 2009, Avery, a mixed-breed dog owned by Kathryn and Jeremy Medlen, escaped the family’s backyard and was promptly picked up by Fort Worth animal control. Jeremy went to retrieve Avery but lacked enough money to pay the required fees. The shelter hung a “hold for owner” tag on Avery’s cage to alert employees that the Medlens were coming for Avery and ensure he was not euthanized. Despite the tag, shelter worker Carla Strickland mistakenly placed Avery on the euthanasia list, and he was put to sleep.</p>
<p id="65fd888c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Jeremy and his two children learned of Avery’s fate a few days later when they returned to retrieve him. Devastated, the Medlens sued Strickland for causing Avery’s death and sought “sentimental or intrinsic value” damages since Avery had little or no market value but was irreplaceable. Strickland specially excepted, contending such damages are unrecoverable in pet-death cases. The trial court directed the Medlens to amend their pleadings to “state a claim for damages recognized at law.” The Medlens amended their petition to drop the words “sentimental value” but realleged damages for Avery’s “intrinsic value.” Strickland specially excepted on the same basis, and the trial court, sure that Texas law barred such damages, dismissed the suit with prejudice.</p>
<p id="65fd888d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court of appeals reversed, becoming the first Texas court to hold that a dog owner may recover intangible loss-of-companionship damages in the form of intrinsic or sentimental-value property damages. Addressing our 1891 decision in <i>Heiligmann v. Rose</i> [16 S.W. 931], which pegged dog-loss damages to market value or a value ascertained from the dog’s “usefulness and services,” the court of appeals stated, “Texas law has changed greatly since 1891” and “sentimental damages may now be recovered for…all types of personal property.” Reinstating the Medlens’ claim, the court of appeals concluded: “Because an owner may be awarded damages based on the sentimental value of lost <span title="598" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-598">p. 598</span>personal property, and because dogs are personal property, the trial court erred in dismissing the Medlens’ action against Strickland.”</p>
<p id="65fd888e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This appeal followed, posing a single, yet significant, issue: whether emotional-injury damages are recoverable for the negligent destruction of a dog.</p>

<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="65fd888f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b">DISCUSSION</p></div>
<p id="65fd8890-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">America is home to 308 million humans and 377 million pets. In fact, “American pets now outnumber American children by more than four to one.” In a nation with about 78 million pet dogs and 86 million pet cats (and 160 million pet fish), where roughly 62% of households own a pet, it is unsurprising that many animal owners view their pets not as mere personal property but as full-fledged family members, and treat them as such:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="65fd8891-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A study found that 70% of pet owners thought of their pets as family members.</p></li>
<li><p id="65fd8892-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">45% of dog owners take their pets on vacation.</p></li>
<li><p id="65fd8893-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Over 50% of pet owners say they would rather be stranded on a deserted island with a dog or cat than with a human.</p></li>
<li><p id="65fd8894-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">50% of pet owners report being “very likely” to put their own lives in danger to save their pets, and 33% are “somewhat likely” to risk their lives.</p></li>
<li><p id="65fd8895-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 2012, Americans spent roughly $53 billion on their pets.</p></li></ul>
<p id="65fd8896-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The human-animal bond is indeed powerful. As the Medlens’ second amended petition states: “The entire Medlen family was devastated by the loss of Avery, who was like a family member to them.” Countless Texas families share this pets-as-family view, but Texas law, for a century-plus, has labeled them as “property” for purposes of tort-law recovery.</p>
<p id="65fd8897-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our analysis begins with <i>Heiligmann v. Rose</i>, our 1891 case upholding $75 in damages for the poisoning of three “well trained” Newfoundland dogs. <i>Heiligmann</i> articulated some key valuation principles for animal cases. First, we classified dogs as personal property for damages purposes, not as something giving rise to personal-injury damages. Second, we declared a “true rule” for damages that flags two elements: (1) “market value, if the dog has any,” or (2) “some special or pecuniary value to the owner, that may be ascertained by reference to the usefulness and services of the dog.”</p>
<p id="65fd8898-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Heiligmann</i>, the dogs “were of fine breed, and well trained,” with one using different barks to signal whether an approaching person was a man, woman, or child. While the owner could sell each dog for $5, they had no market value beyond that, but the Court upheld damages of $25 each:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65fd8899-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no evidence in this case that the dogs had a market value, but the evidence is ample showing the usefulness and services of the dogs, and that they were of special value to the owner. If the jury from the evidence should be satisfied that the <span title="599" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-599">p. 599</span>dogs were serviceable and useful to the owner, they could infer their value when the owner, by evidence, fixes some amount upon which they could form a basis.</p></div>
<p id="65fd889a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Medlens insist that <i>Heiligmann</i> does not limit recovery to an amount based <i>solely</i> on the dog’s economic usefulness and services. Rather, when the Court mentioned certain dogs lacking market value but having “a special value to the owner,” we meant something far broader and distinct from the dogs’ commercial attributes. Similarly, argue the Medlens, when the Court in <i>Heiligmann</i> noted a dog’s “special or pecuniary value to the owner,” the word “or” indicates two distinct categories of non-market value dogs—those with a special value to the owner, and those with a pecuniary value to the owner. We disagree.</p>
<p id="65fdafab-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given its ordinary, contextual meaning, <i>Heiligmann</i> tied the recovery of “special or pecuniary value” to the dogs’ “usefulness and services”—their economic value, not their sentimental value. While we referenced evidence “showing the usefulness and services of the dogs, and that they were of a special value to the owner,” the next conditional sentence pegs the jury’s valuation decision to the dogs’ economic attributes: “If the jury from the evidence should be satisfied that the dogs were serviceable and useful to the owner.…” The decision never references, even by implication, any evidence regarding companionship or owner affection.</p>
<p id="65fdafac-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, a dog’s “special or pecuniary value” refers not to the dog-human bond but to the dollars-and-cents value traceable to the dog’s usefulness and services. Such value is economic value, not emotional value based on affection, attachment, or companionship. In short, <i>Heiligmann’s</i> use of the word “special” does not authorize “special damages” and does not refer generically to a dog’s ability to combat loneliness, ease depression, or provide security. The valuation criteria is not emotional and subjective; rather it is commercial and objective.</p>
<p id="65fdafad-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alternatively, the Medlens assert that [the] post-<i>Heiligmann</i> decision [in] <i>Brown v. Frontier Theatres, Inc</i>. [369 S.W.2d 299 (Tex. 1963)] entitles property owners to seek intrinsic or sentimental-value damages for certain destroyed property that lacks market value or “special or pecuniary” value. Because dogs are considered property under Texas law, they should be treated no differently, argue the Medlens. Accordingly, Avery’s intrinsic value to them, including companionship, is recoverable. We decline to stretch our post-<i>Heiligmann</i> decisions this far.</p>
<p id="65fdafae-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our decision a half-century ago in <i>Brown</i> involved irreplaceable family heirlooms such as a wedding veil, pistol, jewelry, hand-made bedspreads and other items going back several generations—in other words, family keepsakes that “have their primary value in sentiment.” Such one-of-a-kind heirlooms have a “special value…to their owner,” and damages may factor in “the feelings of the owner for such property.” Notably, on the same day we decided <i>Brown</i> fifty years ago, we reaffirmed in another case the default damages rule for destroyed non-heirloom property lacking market or replacement value: “the actual worth or value of the articles to the owner…excluding any fanciful or sentimental considerations.” [<i>Crisp v. Sec. Nat’l Ins. Co.</i>, 369 S.W.2d 326, 328 (Tex. 1963)].</p>
<span title="600" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-600">p. 600</span>
<p id="65fdafaf-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Heiligmann</i> remains our lone case directly on point, and after a century-plus we are loathe to disturb it. An owner’s attachment to a one-of-a-kind family keepsake as in <i>Brown</i> is sentimental, but an owner’s attachment to a beloved pet is more: It is emotional. Pets afford here-and-now benefits—company, recreation, protection, etc.—unlike a passed-down heirloom kept around chiefly to commemorate past events or passed family members. We agree with the amicus brief submitted by the American Kennel Club (joined by several other pet-welfare groups): “While no two pets are alike, the emotional attachments a person establishes with each pet cannot be shoe-horned into keepsake-like sentimentality for litigation purposes.” Finally,…permitting sentiment-based damages for destroyed heirloom property portends nothing resembling the vast public-policy impact of allowing such damages in animal-tort cases.</p>

<p id="65fdd6c4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Loss of companionship, the gravamen of the Medlens’ claim, is fundamentally a form of <i>personal-injury</i> damage, not property damage. It is a component of loss of consortium, including the loss of “love, affection, protection, emotional support, services, companionship, care, and society.” Loss-of-consortium damages are available only for a few especially close family relationships, and to allow them in lost pet cases would be inconsistent with these limitations. Therefore, like courts in the overwhelming majority of other states, the Restatement of the Law of Torts, and the other Texas courts of appeals that have considered this question, we reject emotion-based liability and prohibit recovery for loss of the human-animal bond.</p>
<p id="65fdd6c5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not dispute that dogs are a special form of personal property. That is precisely why Texas law forbids animal cruelty generally (both civilly and criminally), and bans dog fighting and unlawful restraints of dogs specifically—because animals, though property, are unique. Most dogs have a simple job description: provide devoted companionship. We have no need to overrule <i>Brown</i>’s narrow heirloom exception today; neither do we broaden it to pet-death cases and enshrine an expansive new rule that allows recovery for what a canine companion meant to its owner. The Medlens find it odd that Texas law would permit sentimental damages for loss of an heirloom but not an Airedale. Strickland would find it odd if Texas [common] law permitted damages for loss of a Saint Bernard but not for a brother Bernard. The law is no stranger to incongruity, and we need not jettison <i>Brown</i> in order to refuse to extend it to categories of property beyond heirlooms.</p>
<p id="65fdd6c6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The “true rule” in Texas remains this: Where a dog’s market value is unascertainable, the correct damages measure is the dog’s “special or pecuniary value” (that is, its actual value)—the economic value derived from its <span title="601" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-601">p. 601</span>“usefulness and services,” not value drawn from companionship or other non-commercial considerations.</p>

<p id="65fdd6cb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is an inconvenient, yet inescapable, truth: “Tort law…cannot remedy every wrong.” Lines, seemingly arbitrary, are required. No one disputes that a family dog—“in life the firmest friend”—is a treasured companion. But it is also personal property, and the law draws sensible, policy-based distinctions between types of property. The majority rule throughout most of America—including Texas since 1891—leavens warm-heartedness with sober-mindedness, applying a rational rule rather than an emotional one. For the reasons discussed above, we decline to (1) jettison our 122-year-old precedent classifying dogs as ordinary property, and (2) permit non-economic damages rooted in relational attachment.</p>

<p id="65fdfddf-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Personal Injury vs. Property Damages.</i></b> The court in <i>Strickland</i> distinguishes between the items of damage recoverable in personal injury litigation versus property damage cases. Are you persuaded by the court’s distinction between the two? What is the justification for refusing to allow recovery of emotional distress damages (or any other general damage category) for the loss of a family pet despite the court’s acknowledgement that such harm is likely to occur? Is this rule of law consistent with the tort goal of providing full compensation to injured parties?</p>
<p id="65fdfde0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress.</i></b> Where a defendant has negligently caused primary harm to another and this harm has caused secondary and indirect loss to bystanders, we have seen the courts find different doctrinal methods to limit recovery, with the majority of courts adopting the <i>Dillon</i> rule and only permitting close family members who actually witness the death or serious harm to recover for their emotional losses (Chapter 6, Special Duty Rules). If the plaintiff’s argument in <i>Strickland</i> were accepted, what would this do to the sanctity behind the <i>Dillon</i> limitations? <i>Strickland</i> can, therefore, be <span title="602" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-602">p. 602</span>viewed both as a case limiting the nature of damages recoverable when the primary harm was to one’s personal property, as well as a case reaffirming that a <i>Dillon-</i>type of recovery is limited to human family members.</p>
<p id="65fdfde1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Heirloom Exception.</i></b> As the <i>Strickland</i> court acknowledges, one deviation from the general rule limiting damages for loss of personal property to market value arises in the case of items considered family heirlooms that may have no recognizable market value but have great sentimental value. This exception has been found applicable when the item damaged or destroyed was clothing, books, pictures, furniture, or other household goods that had unique personal value to the owner but to no one else. In such cases, courts have recognized that the market value recovery would fail to offer compensation for the real loss and so they permit the jury to assess damages based upon the emotional injury to the owner. On the other hand, is it difficult to conceptualize a legitimate reason for permitting exceptional, emotional-related recovery for damage to an heirloom but not to a pet?</p>

<p id="65fdfde4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While some students might be tempted to view damage issues as an uninteresting after-thought in tort cases, questions regarding what sums should be paid by the tortfeasor often dominate tort litigation. Indeed, in many cases the liability issues are very straightforward and the jury’s primary job is to determine actual damages. Many out-of-court settlement discussions and mediations focus upon the parties’ disparate views of the proper amounts that should be paid to the victim. With regard to special or economic losses, the determination is often aided by relatively concrete formulas approved by the courts to help determine the economic losses suffered due to the defendant’s tortious misconduct. Where the nature of the loss does not involve something that is typically bought or sold in the marketplace—such as disfigurement or pain or emotional distress—the law has had a much more difficult time providing any concrete formulas. Instead, courts often are only able to give the juries vaguely worded principles to guide their deliberations, and appellate courts frequently find their analysis limited to comparing one jury’s award of general damages with other juries’ awards in similar cases. It is rough justice. On the other hand, courts have come up with a variety of concrete rules in cases involving general damages that govern the types of evidence and arguments that lawyers are permitted to present to the jury. In this way, courts try to reign in potential abuses by juries in finding general damages disproportionate to the injuries suffered by plaintiffs. The next section will deal with other potential limits on the recovery of actual damages.</p>

<p id="65fdfde7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus far we have focused upon differentiating between the various types of actual damages and understanding particular analytical issues arising under some of these varieties. A complete understanding of tort law’s treatment of actual damages demands consideration of three additional issues that potentially impact the actual size of compensatory damage recovery in a tort case. First, the doctrine of <i>failure to mitigate damages</i> imposes a post-tort duty upon the plaintiff to exercise reasonable care to treat or lessen the ultimate harm plaintiff suffers and for which plaintiff can expect to receive compensation from the tortfeasor. We will begin with two cases that illustrate the two different analytical approaches to this duty. We will then take up consideration of a hotly debated topic—whether an accident victim’s failure to anticipate a crash and wear a seat belt should have any damage recovery reduced as either evidence of a failure to mitigate or comparative fault. Second, a long established doctrine called <i>the collateral source rule</i> declares that the plaintiff’s receipt of benefits from someone other than the tortfeasor (e.g., health insurance) to help pay or reimburse plaintiff for some of her losses should not work to lessen the tortfeasor’s liability for all of the harm caused. This doctrine has come under attack in recent decades, and some courts (or legislatures) have abandoned it. We will encounter a court considering such a change to the doctrine. Finally, we will consider the epicenter of the tort reform movement—statutory ceilings on a plaintiff’s recovery of actual damages. Many states now have legislatively imposed limits on tort recovery; this has led to constitutional challenges regarding such limits, with mixed results.</p>

<p id="65fe24fa-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The doctrine of <i>failure to mitigate damages</i>—sometimes called the “avoidable consequences rule”—places an obligation on the victim to exercise reasonable care to reduce or “mitigate” her actual damages. Given that so much of tort law deals with the goal of avoiding or deterring losses, placing the duty on the victim makes a lot of sense. Further, to the extent the plaintiff could have minimized some of her losses through exercising reasonable care after the initial injury, tort law believes it inappropriate to reward the plaintiff by awarding full damages. In this instance, the tort goal of providing compensation to worthy victims only demands compensating the plaintiff for unavoidable losses. While all courts place this expectation—or duty—upon the plaintiff, there are two different conceptual ways of implementing this doctrine. The traditional method of enforcing this obligation is for courts to consider the failure to mitigate damages to be a <i>damage limiting doctrine</i> by which the jury is merely instructed in finding the actual damages to not include any sums that the plaintiff could <span title="604" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-604">p. 604</span>have avoided by exercising reasonable care in responding to the injuries. Some other courts, however, after moving away from contributory negligence to some form of comparative fault, have chosen to consider a breach of the duty to exercise reasonable care in minimizing harm to be a type of <i>fault</i> (negligence) and will apportion this fault and reduce damages post-verdict by judicial action. See how the two courts below follow each of these two models, and consider whether it makes a difference which conceptual approach a state chooses.</p>

Connie’s duty is to use ordinary care in consulting a physician. There is, however, testimony by one of Connie’s doctors that additional chiropractic treatments would have helped Connie’s condition.

Defendant points to the testimony of Dr. Gary W. Roat, and claims that it creates an issue on the question of mitigation. Dr. Roat, a neurologist, testified that the plaintiff had come to him on referral from another physician about a year after the accident and that he had treated the plaintiff a number of times for numbness and tingling in his hand as well as back and leg pain. After trying several medications, Dr. Roat recommended that plaintiff undergo additional diagnostic tests, including nerve conduction studies, an electromyelographic examination, and a myelogram to determine whether he had a herniated disk.

Do you see how the difference in approach might lead to the exact same result? Can you think of an instance where it might matter? Consider a situation where the plaintiff suffers a compound fracture in an auto accident due to the defendant’s fault and is treated at an emergency room. Among other things, the <span title="607" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-607">p. 607</span>plaintiff is given antibiotics to take for possible infection. Plaintiff fails to take the medicine, the wound is horribly infected and she ultimately loses the limb. In her suit for all of her damages from the other driver, do you see why a jury might consider that a significant percentage of her injuries were her own fault? If so, and if the state treats a failure to mitigate as a type of “fault” to be apportioned, what percentage might the jury apply? What happens if the state is a 49 percent or 50 percent modified comparative fault jurisdiction and the jury translates the plaintiff’s failure to mitigate into an apportionment of fault, giving the plaintiff 75 percent of the total fault and the defendant driver only 25 percent? How much does the plaintiff recover? If the state, however, treats the plaintiff’s failure to mitigate as merely a damages issue, how much might the plaintiff recover? This possibility of the failure to mitigate acting as a complete bar to recovery (despite the defendant being solely to blame for the accident itself) might be a good reason for a state to reject the treatment of mitigation as a comparative fault proposition.</p>

<p id="65fec177-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For more than forty years evidence of a plaintiff’s failure to use a seat belt has been inadmissible in car-accident cases. That rule, which this Court first announced in 1974, offered plaintiffs safe harbor from the harshness of an all-or-nothing scheme that barred recovery for even the slightest contributory negligence. Moreover, the Court reasoned that although a plaintiff’s failure to use a seat belt may exacerbate his injuries, it cannot <i>cause</i> a car accident, and therefore should not affect a plaintiff’s recovery.</p>
<p id="65fec178-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1985 the Legislature jumped in to statutorily prohibit evidence of use or nonuse of seat belts in all civil cases. It repealed that law in 2003, leaving our rule to again stand alone. But much has changed in the past four decades. The Legislature has overhauled Texas’ system for apportioning fault in negligence cases—a plaintiff’s negligence can now be apportioned alongside a defendant’s without entirely barring the plaintiff’s recovery. And unlike in 1974, seat belts are now required by law and have become an unquestioned part of daily life for the vast majority of drivers and passengers.</p>
<p id="65fec179-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These changes have rendered our prohibition on seat-belt evidence an anachronism. The rule may have been appropriate in its time, but today it is a vestige of a bygone legal system and an oddity in light of modern societal norms. Today we overrule it and hold that relevant evidence of use or nonuse of seat belts is admissible for the purpose of apportioning responsibility in civil lawsuits.</p>

<p id="65fec17b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case arises from a collision between a Nabors Well Services, Ltd. transport truck and a Chevrolet Suburban with eight occupants—three adults and five children. Both vehicles were traveling southbound on two-lane U.S. Highway 285 in rural West Texas. As the transport truck slowed to make a left turn into a Nabors facility, Martin Soto, the Suburban’s driver, pulled into the opposing traffic lane and attempted to pass the transport truck. As Soto passed, the transport truck began its left turn and clipped the Suburban, which careened off the highway and rolled multiple times. The evidence is disputed as to whether the transport truck used a turn signal and for how long and whether Soto could have passed the transport truck within the legal passing zone.</p>

<p id="65fee88c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Aydee Romero, an adult passenger, was killed in the accident. Martin, his wife Esperanza Soto, and all five children—Esperanza, Guadalupe, and Marielena Soto, and Edgar and Saul Romero—suffered injuries. There is conflicting evidence as to which occupants were belted and which were ejected from the Suburban. A responding state trooper wrote in his report that all occupants were unrestrained except Marielena and the elder Esperanza. But both of them, along with the younger Esperanza, testified they did not use seat belts, while Martin and Guadalupe testified they wore theirs. Guadalupe testified all occupants were ejected except for Martin and Edgar, but Edgar testified he was ejected. And an EMS report stated one of the family members reported at the scene that seven of eight occupants were ejected.</p>
<p id="65fee88d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Soto and Romero families sued Nabors and its truck driver. At trial, Nabors sought to offer expert testimony from a biomechanical engineer, James Funk, Ph.D., that seven of the eight Suburban occupants were unbelted (all except Martin, the driver), that five of those seven were ejected from the vehicle, and that the failure to use seat belts caused the passengers’ injuries and the one fatality. Nabors also hoped to introduce evidence of a citation issued to Soto for driving without properly restraining the child passengers as well as testimony from the plaintiffs as to who was unbelted and who was ejected.</p>
<p id="65fee88e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Following our precedent in <i>Carnation Co. v. Wong</i>, 516 S.W.2d 116 (Tex. 1974), the trial court excluded all evidence of nonuse of seat belts. The jury found Nabors 51% and Soto 49% responsible for the accident, and awarded the Soto and Romero families collectively just over $2.3 million. The court of appeals affirmed the trial court’s judgment based solely on the <i>Carnation</i> prohibition on seat-belt evidence. We granted review to consider the current viability of <i>Carnation</i> in light of the Legislature’s repeal of its statutory ban on seat-belt evidence.</p>

<p id="65fee891-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Texas’s earliest cases on the admissibility of seat-belt evidence first appeared in the late 1960s. The context within which these cases arose is instructive. First, there was no law requiring seat-belt use; in fact, a federal mandate that seat belts be installed as standard equipment on all new passenger vehicles was barely in its infancy. And second, Texas courts operated under an unforgiving all-or-nothing rule in negligence cases that entirely barred a plaintiff from recovery if the plaintiff himself was negligent in any way.</p>
<p id="65fee892-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court first encountered the issue in <i>Kerby v. Abilene Christian College</i>, in which the driver of a linen truck, Kerby, was ejected through the open sliding door of his truck after colliding with an ACC bus. 503 S.W.2d 526, 526 (Tex. 1973). The jury found Kerby negligent and 35% responsible for his injuries. The trial court accordingly reduced Kerby’s recovery by 35%, but the court of <span title="610" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-610">p. 610</span>appeals tossed his award entirely because under the law at the time his contributory negligence barred any recovery whatsoever. This Court reversed both lower courts and restored Kerby’s recovery in full, reasoning that “[c]ontributory negligence must have the causal connection with the accident that but for the conduct the accident would not have happened.” Accordingly, “negligence that merely increases or adds to the extent of the loss or injury occasioned by another’s negligence is not such contributory negligence as will defeat recovery.” In so holding, the Court drew “a sharp distinction between negligence contributing to the accident and negligence contributing to the damages sustained.” The Court further likened the facts of <i>Kerby</i> to earlier cases in which courts of appeals held the failure to use a seat belt was not “actionable negligence” or “contributory negligence such that would bar recovery,” and underscored the “conceptual difficulty of applying the mitigation of [damages concept to Plaintiff’s conduct antedating the negligence of the Defendant.” <i>Id</i>. In so doing, the Court declared seat-belt evidence incompatible with the only two legal doctrines—contributory negligence and failure to mitigate damages—that arguably could accommodate it.</p>
<p id="65fee893-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A year later in <i>Carnation v. Wong</i>, the jury found plaintiffs involved in a car accident negligent for failing to use seat belts. The jury attributed 50% of the fault for the husband’s injuries against him and 70% of the fault for the wife’s injuries against her. The trial court reduced the Wongs’ awards correspondingly, but the court of appeals overturned those reductions. Finding no reversible error, this Court announced: “We now hold that…persons whose negligence did not contribute to an automobile accident should not have the damages awarded to them reduced or mitigated because of their failure to wear available seat belts.”</p>

<p id="65fee895-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">About a decade after <i>Carnation</i>, the federal government began to push seat-belt-use initiatives that would give rise to the first seat-belt laws in Texas. The Texas Legislature, along with many others, responded, and in 1985 for the first time made it a criminal offense for anyone fifteen years or older to ride in a front seat unbelted, and further placed on drivers a responsibility to properly restrain children under fifteen riding in a front seat. The new law further provided that: “Use or nonuse of a safety belt is not admissible evidence in a civil trial.” And with that prohibition, <i>Carnation</i> was mothballed—not stricken from the books but preempted by a stricter statutory prohibition. The prohibition against seat-belt evidence in civil trials remained intact throughout the law’s evolution until 2003, when the Legislature repealed the provision as part of the sweeping tort-reform legislation. The Legislature did not replace the prohibition with any language affirming the use of seat-belt evidence—it simply struck the provision altogether.</p>

<p id="65fee897-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Everyone in this case agrees the statutory repeal revived this Court’s holding in <i>Carnation</i>, a common-law rule subsumed for eighteen years by a broader statutory prohibition but never overruled. The question is whether that rule, established more than forty years ago, should still stand today. While the Legislature now says nothing about seat-belt evidence specifically, it has said much since <i>Carnation</i> about the assignment of responsibility in negligence lawsuits.</p>
<p id="65ff0ea8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the time <i>Kerby</i> and <i>Carnation</i> were tried, Texas followed the all-or-nothing system of contributory negligence. Under contributory negligence, if a plaintiff was even one percent at fault, he or she could not recover. [Beginning in 1973, the legislature adopted a 50% comparative responsibility system which is now embodied in Chapter 33 of Texas’ Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code.] Gone is the “harsh system of absolute victory or total defeat.” <i>See Parker</i>, 565 S.W.2d at 518. Under [the current law a plaintiff who is no more than 50% at fault merely has damages reduced according to the plaintiff’s percentage of fault]. And the statute casts a wide net over conduct that may be considered in this determination, including negligent acts or omissions as well as any conduct or activity that violates an applicable legal standard. The directive is clear—fact-finders should consider each person’s role in causing, “in any way,” harm for which recovery of damages is sought. The question we now face is whether the “sharp distinction” between occurrence-causing and injury-causing negligence this Court drew in <i>Kerby</i> is still viable in light of the Legislature’s current mandate. In other words, can a plaintiff’s failure to use a seat belt, though it did not cause the car accident, limit his recovery if it can be shown that the failure to use a seat belt caused or contributed to cause his injuries?</p>
<p id="65ff0ea9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The systematic elimination of outmoded ameliorative doctrines has led to speculation about the continued viability of the “sharp distinction” we recognized in <i>Kerby</i>. The Third Restatement has specifically cited <i>Carnation</i> as an example of how “[s]ome courts used to forgive a plaintiff of <i>pre-accident</i> negligence that merely aggravated the injury.” Restatement (Third) of Torts: Apportionment of Liab. §3 Reporter’s Note, cmt. b at 39 (2000) (emphasis in original). Of such decisions, the Restatement observes:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65ff0eaa-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">They gave various rationales for this rule, including that the legislature had not mandated the conduct, that counting the conduct would constitute a windfall for the defendant, and that a plaintiff should not have to foresee and guard against the possibility of a defendant’s negligence. None of these rationales provides an adequate account for the rule, because each of them could be applied with equal force to ordinary contributory negligence. The most satisfactory explanation is that courts were hostile to the harsh consequences of contributory negligence as an absolute bar to recovery and developed the rule as an ameliorative device. Comparative responsibility eviscerates that rationale.</p></div>
<p id="65ff0eab-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our precedents holding that a plaintiff’s injury-causing negligence cannot reduce a plaintiff’s recovery cannot stand if today’s proportionate-responsibility <span title="612" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-612">p. 612</span>statute contradicts those precedents. And we hold it does. We recently observed in <i>Dugger</i> that the proportionate-responsibility statute “indicates the Legislature’s desire to compare responsibility for <i>injuries</i> rather than bar recovery, even if the claimant was partly at fault or violated some legal standard.” <i>Dugger</i>, 408 S.W.3d at 832.</p>
<p id="65ff0eac-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Furthermore, [our current comparative responsibility laws] focus the fact-finder on assigning responsibility for the “harm for which recovery of damages is sought”—two examples of which are “personal injury” and “death”—and not strictly for the underlying occurrence, such as a car accident. This distinction recognizes plaintiffs do not sue simply because they were involved in a car accident; they sue because they suffered damages for which they have not been compensated. Accordingly, the question is not simply who caused the car accident, but who caused the plaintiff’s injuries.</p>
<p id="65ff0ead-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We believe most reasonable people considering who caused a plaintiff’s injuries in a car accident would not lean on a logical distinction between occurrence-causing and injury-causing conduct. Rather, most would say a plaintiff who breaks the law or otherwise acts negligently by not using a seat belt is at least partially responsible for the harm that befalls him. This is true even if he did not cause the car accident, provided it can be shown the failure to buckle up exacerbated his injuries.</p>
<p id="65ff0eae-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given the statute’s plain language, we conclude that, for purposes of the proportionate-responsibility statute, the Legislature both intends and requires fact-finders to consider relevant evidence of a plaintiff’s pre-occurrence, injury-causing conduct. This comports with the modern trend in tort law toward “abolishing doctrines that give all-or-nothing effect to certain types of plaintiff’s negligence based on the timing of the plaintiff’s and defendant’s negligence” and instead considering “the timing of the plaintiff’s and defendant’s negligence [as] factors for assigning percentages of responsibility.” Restatement (Third) of Torts: Apportionment of Liab. §3, Reporter’s Note, cmt. b at 41.</p>
<p id="65ff0eaf-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today’s holding opens the door to a category of evidence that has never been part of our negligence cases, but we need not lay down a treatise on how and when such evidence should be admitted. Seat-belt evidence has been unique only in that it has been categorically prohibited in negligence cases. With that prohibition lifted, our rules of evidence include everything necessary to handle the admissibility of seat-belt evidence. As with any evidence, seat-belt evidence is admissible only if it is relevant. The defendant can establish the relevance of seat-belt nonuse only with evidence that nonuse caused or contributed to cause the plaintiff’s injuries. And the trial court should first consider this evidence, for the purpose of making its relevance determination, outside the presence of the jury.</p>
<p id="65ff0eb0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The fact-finder may consider relevant evidence of a plaintiff’s failure to use a seat belt as a “negligent act or omission” or as a violation of “an applicable legal standard” in cases where the plaintiff was personally in violation of an applicable seat-belt law. And in cases in which an unrestrained plaintiff was not personally in violation of a seat-belt law, the fact-finder may consider whether <span title="613" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-613">p. 613</span>the plaintiff was negligent under the applicable standard of reasonable care. This scenario is likely to arise when children are among the passengers of the plaintiff’s vehicle. Most children do not violate seat-belt laws by failing to restrain themselves; rather, it is the driver upon whom the law places the responsibility to properly restrain them. Nonetheless, a minor is still held to the degree of care that would be exercised by an “ordinarily prudent child of [the same] age, intelligence, experience and capacity…under the same or similar circumstances.” <i>Rudes v. Gottschalk</i>, 159 Tex. 552, 324 S.W.2d 201, 204 (Tex. 1959). The jury may further apportion third-party responsibility to the person upon whom the law places the burden to properly restrain the child.</p>
<p id="65ff0eb1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There also should be no confusion on the relationship of this holding with the existing failure-to-mitigate-damages doctrine. A plaintiff’s failure to mitigate his damages traditionally occurs post-occurrence and the doctrine does not readily translate in the pre-occurrence context. That distinction remains. A plaintiff’s post-occurrence failure to mitigate his damages operates as a reduction of his damages award and is not considered in the responsibility apportionment. It is only the plaintiff’s <i>pre</i>-occurrence, injury-causing conduct that should be considered in the responsibility apportionment.</p>

<p id="65ff0eb3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today’s holding is rooted in statutory interpretation and the unavoidable conclusion that our proportionate-responsibility statute both allows and requires fact-finders to consider pre-occurrence, injury-causing conduct. But the arguments against allowing seat-belt evidence, including some urged by the families in this case, transcend statutory interpretation and touch on themes of general fairness and fundamental principles of tort law. We respond to them because we believe our holding is not merely correct statutory interpretation; it also promotes sound public policy.</p>
<p id="65ff0eb4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Attitudes toward use of seat belts have evolved drastically since the early 1970s. When we decided <i>Kerby</i> and <i>Carnation</i>, seat-belt use was not required by law. Seat-belt laws are now in effect in every state, and the vast majority of Texans buckle up on a regular basis. Yet until today a contradictory legal system punished seat-belt nonuse with criminal citations while allowing plaintiffs in civil lawsuits to benefit from juries’ ignorance of their misconduct.</p>
<p id="65ff0eb5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some argue that admitting seat-belt evidence violates the principle that a plaintiff is not required to anticipate the negligent or unlawful conduct of another. <i>See Humble Oil &amp; Refining Co. v. Martin</i>, 148 Tex. 175, 222 S.W.2d 995, 1001 (Tex. 1949) (noting the “general axiom that a person is not bound to anticipate the negligence of others”). But this has never been a steadfast rule of tort law. Rather, it is a guiding principle the law has balanced with the duty everyone has to guard against foreseeable risks—a duty that has been recognized at least since <i>Palsgraf v. Long Island R. Co</i>., 248 N.Y. 339, 162 N.E. 99 (N.Y. 1928). The general danger of driving is obvious to everyone. So when it comes to foreseeing the general hazard of automobile travel, “[t]here <span title="614" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-614">p. 614</span>is nothing to anticipate; the negligence of other motorists is omnipresent.” <i>Law v. Superior Court</i>, 157 Ariz. 147, 755 P.2d 1135, 1141 (Ariz. 1988). Indeed, by enacting seat-belt laws, the Legislature has required motorists to anticipate the negligence of others.</p>
<p id="65ff35c6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, some insist that admitting seat-belt evidence provides a windfall for defendants who will be relieved of paying the full damages caused by their negligence. But the reverse is equally arguable—a plaintiff whose injuries were exacerbated by failure to use a seat belt benefits from the jury’s ignorance of his own conduct. The result is certainly an oddity: the unbelted plaintiff is likely to be punished with a criminal citation carrying a monetary fine from the police officer investigating the accident, but in the civil courtroom his illegal conduct will be rewarded by monetary compensation. There are no windfalls under the rule we announce today. Even when trial courts properly admit seat-belt evidence, defendants will still be held liable for the damages they caused, but not the injuries the plaintiff caused by not using a seat belt.</p>
<p id="65ff35c7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We hold relevant evidence of use or nonuse of seat belts, and relevant evidence of a plaintiff’s pre-occurrence, injury-causing conduct generally, is admissible for the purpose of apportioning responsibility under our proportionate-responsibility statute, provided that the plaintiff’s conduct caused or was a cause of his damages. Accordingly, we reverse the court of appeals’ judgment and remand this case to the court of appeals for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

<p id="65ff35ca-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1.  <i>Trend In Recognizing Seat-Belt Defense.</i></b> The court in <i>Nabors</i> discusses the fact that traditional tort concepts—like the duty to protect oneself from foreseeable dangers—argue in favor of permitting jury consideration of seat-belt non-use to reduce damages. In doing so, the court admits, however, that seat-belt non-use cannot be considered a classic form of failure to mitigate because it happens before the injury rather than constituting an unreasonable response to an injury. On the other hand, the court no longer finds a disconnect in applying comparative fault principles to seat belt non-use. The court reasons that the jury is being asked to apportion between the collision-causing defendant’s fault in causing the accident and the plaintiff’s fault in enhancing the injuries beyond what would have been suffered. It helped in that case that the jurisdiction’s comparative fault statute asks jurors to apportion fault for the <i>injuries or harm</i> rather than for causing the accident itself. Further, the court mentions two other changes in the legal context that prompted the court to re-visit the matter: (1) the switch away from contributory negligence (that would have completely barred a claim if seat-belt non-use had been considered negligence) to a comparative fault system that still permits some reduced recovery despite a plaintiff’s negligence; and (2) the fault of the plaintiff <span title="615" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-615">p. 615</span>in failing to wear a seat belt is typically more stark now in light of statutes in every state generally mandating seat belt usage. Does the court limit its holding, however, to scenarios where a statute has been violated by the plaintiff?</p>
<p id="65ff35cb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Problems.</i></b> How might the following scenarios be handled when a jurisdiction decides to permit a seat-belt defense?</p>

<li class=""><p id="65ff35cc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Texas, where <i>Nabors</i> was decided, the court acknowledges that the state has adopted a 50 percent comparative fault rule. What if Bill broadsides into Jim’s vehicle by wrongfully running a red light? The impact causes Jim’s car to roll over and he is ejected due to not wearing a seat belt and, as a result, suffers a fractured neck and becomes a quadriplegic. Despite undisputed evidence that Bill was solely responsible for the collision and the ensuing roll-over, the jury apportions the total fault (taking into account the seat belt non-use) as follows: Jim 75 percent and Bill 25 percent. The total damages are $10 million. How much will Jim recover from Bill?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="65ff35cd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the same accident as the preceding hypothetical, a five-year-old child, Freddy, is also unrestrained in the back seat of Jim’s vehicle. Freddy likewise is ejected during the roll-over. May the jury assess fault against Freddy though the applicable seat-belt statute does not impose a statutory duty on the child to wear a seat belt (only on the adult driver to have the child restrained)? May the jury reduce the damages awardable to Freddy from his failure to wear a seat belt?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="65ff35ce-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hillary is riding her motorcycle when she is side-swiped by Donald, the driver of a pick-up truck, who fails to notice the motorcyclist next to him. Hillary suffers a severe brain injury as she was not wearing a helmet. (Her state does not mandate a helmet for riders who have taken a training course.) She also suffers multiple fractures in her arms and legs, but they heal. The brain injury will be a lifelong disability, however, and the evidence suggests that had Hillary worn a helmet she would not have suffered a permanent brain injury. Does the rule from <i>Nabors</i> also allow Donald to reduce or escape responsibility for paying for all the damages from the accident he caused? Consider Jones v. Harley-Davidson, Inc., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 123225 (E.D. Tex. 2016).</p></li>

Of course, it has no air bag because this technology didn’t exist when the car was manufactured. Paul bought it (paying a high price) at a recent auction. Unfortunately, when Ringo swerves across the center yellow line on a country highway and causes a head-on collision with Paul late one evening, Paul is killed due to the force of the impact despite wearing his seat belt. Defendant proffers an expert witness at trial who says that if Paul had been driving a car with an air bag, he would have likely survived the collision with treatable injuries. May the jury be permitted to reduce the damage recovery of his estate in the ensuing wrongful death and survival claim due to his failure to drive a vehicle with air bags?</p></li></ol>

<p id="65ff35d2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>collateral source rule</i> forbids the reduction of the claimant’s actual damages by virtue of the claimant’s receipt of any benefit from a third party (e.g., a health insurance company) that offset the harms for which the claimant seeks recovery from the tortfeasor. To many first confronting this doctrine, the initial reaction is shock. Why should the defendant be forced to pay the plaintiff for certain damages for which he has been reimbursed? Doesn’t this act as a potentially huge windfall for the plaintiff and unnecessarily increase tort judgments and the defendant’s litigation losses? This common law rule was not fashioned without acknowledgment of these arguments, and many courts still find the doctrine to be sound despite the challenges to it. However, some courts and legislatures have abandoned or limited the doctrine as a type of tort reform. As you read the following case, consider who might benefit from the windfall under both the existing doctrine and its alternative.</p>

<p id="65ff5ce9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants appeal from a judgment of the Los Angeles Superior Court entered on a verdict in favor of plaintiff, Julius J. Helfend, for $16,400 in general and special damages for injuries sustained in a bus-auto collision that occurred on July 19, 1965, in the City of Los Angeles.</p>
<p id="65ff5cea-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have concluded that the judgment for plaintiff in this tort action against the defendant governmental entity should be affirmed. The trial court properly followed the collateral source rule in excluding evidence that a portion of plaintiff’s medical bills had been paid through a medical insurance plan that requires the refund of benefits from tort recoveries.</p>
<p id="65ff5ceb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Shortly before noon on July 19, 1965, plaintiff drove his car in central Los Angeles east on Third Street approaching Grandview. At this point Third Street had six lanes, four for traffic and one parking lane on each side of the thoroughfare. While traveling in the second lane from the curb, plaintiff observed an automobile driven by Glen A. Raney, Jr., stopping in his lane and preparing to back into a parking space. Plaintiff put out his left arm to signal the traffic behind him that he intended to stop; he then brought his vehicle to a halt so that the other driver could park.</p>
<p id="65ff5cec-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At about this time Kenneth A. Mitchell, a bus driver for the Southern California Rapid Transit District, pulled out of a bus stop at the curb of Third Street and headed in the same direction as plaintiff. Approaching plaintiff’s and Raney’s cars which were stopped in the second lane from the curb, <span title="617" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-617">p. 617</span>Mitchell pulled out into the lane closest to the center of the street in order to pass. The right rear of the bus sideswiped plaintiff’s vehicle, knocking off the rear-view mirror and crushing plaintiff’s arm, which had been hanging down at the side of his car in the stopping signal position.</p>
<p id="65ff5ced-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An ambulance took plaintiff to Central Receiving Hospital for emergency first aid treatment. Upon release from the hospital plaintiff proceeded to consult Dr. Saxon, an orthopedic specialist, who sent plaintiff immediately to the Sherman Oaks Community Hospital where he received treatment for about a week. Plaintiff underwent physical therapy for about six months in order to regain normal use of his left arm and hand. He acquired some permanent discomfort but no permanent disability from the injuries sustained in the accident. At the time of the injury plaintiff was 67 years of age and had a life expectancy of about 11 years. He owned the Jewel Homes Investment Company which possessed and maintained small rental properties. Prior to the accident plaintiff had performed much of the minor maintenance on his properties including some painting and minor plumbing. For the six-month healing period he hired a man to do all the work he had formerly performed and at the time of the trial still employed him for such work as he himself could not undertake.</p>
<p id="65ff83fe-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff filed a tort action against the Southern California Rapid Transit District, a public entity, and Mitchell, an employee of the transit district. At trial plaintiff claimed slightly more than $2,700 in special damages, including $921 in doctor’s bills, a $336.99 hospital bill, and about $45 for medicines.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10DC5_a395957d-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10DC5_a395957d-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d">5</a></span> Defendant requested permission to show that about 80 percent of the plaintiff’s hospital bill had been paid by plaintiff’s Blue Cross insurance carrier and that some of his other medical expenses may have been paid by other insurance. The superior court thoroughly considered the then very recent case of <i>City of Salinas</i> v. <i>Souza &amp; McCue Constr. Co</i>., 424 P.2d 921 (Cal. 1967), distinguished the <i>Souza</i> case on the ground that <i>Souza</i> involved a contract setting, and concluded that the judgment should not be reduced to the extent of the amount of insurance payments which plaintiff received. The court ruled that defendants should not be permitted to show that plaintiff had received medical coverage from any collateral source.</p>
<p id="65ff8400-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After the jury verdict in favor of plaintiff in the sum of $16,400, defendants appealed, raising [as their primary argument that] trial court committed prejudicial error in refusing to allow the introduction of evidence to the effect that a portion of the plaintiff’s medical bills had been paid from a collateral source.</p>
<p id="65ff8401-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We must decide whether the collateral source rule applies to tort actions…in which the plaintiff has received benefits from his medical insurance coverage.</p>
<p id="65ff8402-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court of California has long adhered to the doctrine that if an injured party receives some compensation for his injuries from a source wholly <span title="618" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-618">p. 618</span>independent of the tortfeasor, such payment should not be deducted from the damages which the plaintiff would otherwise collect from the tortfeasor. See, e.g., <i>Peri</i> v. <i>Los Angeles Junction Ry. Co</i>., 137 P.2d 441 (Cal. 1943) [(plaintiff victim of auto accident was entitled to undiminished recovery for lost past wages despite having insurance that reimbursed plaintiff for $2 per day for time off of work because the “[d]amages recoverable for a wrong are not diminished…by [being] indemnified for his loss by insurance effected by him, and to the procurement of which the defendant did not contribute)]. As recently as August 1968 we unanimously reaffirmed our adherence to this doctrine, which is known as the “collateral source rule.”</p>
<p id="65ff8403-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the collateral source rule remains generally accepted in the United States, nevertheless many other jurisdictions have restricted or repealed it. In this country most commentators have criticized the rule and called for its early demise. In <i>Souza</i> we took note of the academic criticism of the rule, characterized the rule as “punitive,” and held it inapplicable to the governmental entity involved in that case. [The court then noted that <i>Souza</i> was a breach of contract case and not a tort case and that the receipt of benefits did not truly come from an independent source.]</p>
<p id="65ff8404-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The collateral source rule as applied here embodies the venerable concept that a person who has invested years of insurance premiums to assure his medical care should receive the benefits of his thrift. The tortfeasor should not garner the benefits of his victim’s providence.</p>
<p id="65ff8405-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The collateral source rule expresses a policy judgment in favor of encouraging citizens to purchase and maintain insurance for personal injuries and for other eventualities. Courts consider insurance a form of investment, the benefits of which become payable without respect to any other possible source of funds. If we were to permit a tortfeasor to mitigate damages with payments from plaintiff’s insurance, plaintiff would be in a position inferior to that of having bought no insurance, because his payment of premiums would have earned no benefit. Defendant should not be able to avoid payment of full compensation for the injury inflicted merely because the victim has had the foresight to provide himself with insurance.</p>
<p id="65ff8406-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some commentators object that the above approach to the collateral source rule provides plaintiff with a “double recovery,” rewards him for the injury, and defeats the principle that damages should compensate the victim but not punish the tortfeasor. We agree with Professor Fleming’s observation, however, that “double recovery is justified only in the face of some exceptional, supervening reason, as in the case of accident or life insurance, where it is felt unjust that the tortfeasor should take advantage of the thrift and prescience of the victim in having paid the premium.” Fleming, <i>Introduction to the Law of Torts</i> (1967) p. 131. As we point out <i>infra</i>, recovery in a wrongful death action is not defeated by the payment of the benefit on a life insurance policy.</p>
<p id="65ff8407-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Furthermore, insurance policies increasingly provide for either subrogation or refund of benefits upon a tort recovery, and such refund is indeed called for in the present case. See Fleming, <i>The Collateral Source Rule and Loss Allocation in <span title="619" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-619">p. 619</span>Tort Law, supra</i>, 54 Cal. L. Rev. 1478, 1479. Hence, the plaintiff receives no double recovery; the collateral source rule simply…permits a proper transfer of risk from the plaintiff’s insurer to the tortfeasor by way of the victim’s tort recovery. The double shift from the tortfeasor to the victim and then from the victim to his insurance carrier can normally occur with little cost in that the insurance carrier is often intimately involved in the initial litigation and quite automatically receives its part of the tort settlement or verdict.</p>
<p id="65ffab18-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even in cases in which the contract or the law precludes subrogation or refund of benefits,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10E14_a395957d-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10E14_a395957d-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d">17</a></span> or in situations in which the collateral source waives such subrogation or refund, the rule performs entirely necessary functions in the computation of damages. For example, the cost of medical care often provides both attorneys and juries in tort cases with an important measure for assessing the plaintiff’s general damages. To permit the defendant to tell the jury that the plaintiff has been recompensed by a collateral source for his medical costs might irretrievably upset the complex, delicate, and somewhat indefinable calculations which result in the normal jury verdict.</p>
<p id="65ffab1a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We also note that generally the jury is not informed that plaintiff’s attorney will receive a large portion of the plaintiff’s recovery in contingent fees or that personal injury damages…are normally deductible by the defendant. Hence, the plaintiff rarely actually receives full compensation for his injuries as computed by the jury. The collateral source rule partially serves to compensate for the attorney’s share and does not actually render “double recovery” for the plaintiff. Indeed, many jurisdictions that have abolished or limited the collateral source rule have also established a means for assessing the plaintiff’s costs for counsel directly against the defendant rather than imposing the contingent fee system.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10E2A_a395957d-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10E2A_a395957d-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d">19</a></span> In sum, the plaintiff’s recovery for his medical expenses from both the tortfeasor and his medical insurance program will not usually give him “double recovery,” but partially provides a somewhat closer approximation to full compensation for his injuries.</p>
<p id="65ffab1c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If we consider the collateral source rule as applied here in the context of the entire American approach to the law of torts and damages, we find that the rule <span title="620" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-620">p. 620</span>presently performs a number of legitimate and even indispensable functions. Without a thorough revolution in the American approach to torts and the consequent damages, the rule at least with respect to medical insurance benefits has become so integrated within our present system that its precipitous judicial nullification would work hardship. In this case the collateral source rule lies between two systems for the compensation of accident victims: the traditional tort recovery based on fault and the increasingly prevalent coverage based on non-fault insurance. Neither system possesses such universality of coverage or completeness of compensation that we can easily dispense with the collateral source rule’s approach to meshing the two systems. The reforms which many academicians propose cannot easily be achieved through piecemeal common law development; the proposed changes, if desirable, would be more effectively accomplished through legislative reform. In any case, we cannot believe that the judicial repeal of the collateral source rule, as applied in the present case, would be the place to begin the needed changes.</p>
<p id="65ffab1d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although in the special circumstances of <i>Souza</i> we characterized the collateral source rule as “punitive” in nature, we have pointed out the several legitimate and fully justified compensatory functions of the rule. In fact, if the collateral source rule were actually punitive, it could apply only in cases of oppression, fraud, or malice and would be inapplicable to most tort, and almost all negligence, cases regardless of whether a governmental entity were involved. We therefore reaffirm our adherence to the collateral source rule in tort cases in which the plaintiff has been compensated by an independent collateral source—such as insurance, pension, continued wages, or disability payments—for which he had actually or constructively paid or in cases in which the collateral source would be recompensed from the tort recovery through subrogation, refund of benefits, or some other arrangement. Hence, we conclude that in a case in which a tort victim has received partial compensation from medical insurance coverage entirely independent of the tortfeasor the trial court properly followed the collateral source rule and foreclosed defendant from mitigating damages by means of the collateral payments.</p>

<p id="65ffab21-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Subrogation.</i></b> The court discusses subrogation, which was applicable to the plaintiff’s recovery in that case, as one justification for maintaining the collateral source rule. Although the plaintiff might theoretically receive a windfall if it recovers as medical expenses from a tortfeasor sums for which a health insurer has already reimbursed it, when the insurer has a right to subrogation that windfall is eliminated. Subrogation typically exists either due to the contractual terms of the insurance policy (as a matter of contract law) or by operation of a statute that expressly provides for subrogation rights in <span title="621" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-621">p. 621</span>certain instances. For example, worker’s compensation insurers are typically granted a right to subrogation when the hurt employee has a claim against a tortfeasor. These insurers frequently intervene in litigation brought by worker’s compensation beneficiaries in order to protect their subrogation interest. In those cases, the insurer typically gets to keep the first fruits on the applicable recovered damages until the amount of their subrogation lien has been satisfied. For this reason, such insurers are often present during pre-trial settlement conferences and mediation because no deal resolving the litigation can be obtained without their participation and acquiescence.</p>
<p id="65ffd232-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Windfall Arguments.</i></b> No matter what system is used, there is a windfall available to someone. Under the collateral source rule the windfall either goes to the plaintiff, or, if there is subrogation permitted by a health insurance company, to the insurer (which has received premiums to pay for losses but ends up not paying out on a loss). When the collateral source rule is legislatively eliminated, the tortfeasor (and its liability insurance company) receives a windfall because its tort liability is reduced as a result of the plaintiff’s foresight to arrange for insurance coverage.</p>
<p id="65ffd233-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Legislative Repeal.</i></b> Some legislative bodies have disagreed with the <i>Helfend</i> arguments for retaining the common law collateral source rule. In fact, the California legislature ultimately enacted a statute that abrogates the collateral source rule in medical malpractice cases, allowing doctors to offer evidence to the jury of the plaintiff’s receipt of benefits (such as health insurance) in order to reduce the damages awarded. <i>See</i> Calif. Civ. Code §3333.1; Fein v. Permanente Medical Group, 695 P.2d 665 (Cal. 1985) (upholding the constitutionality of this statutory reversal of the collateral source rule, saying it was within the legislature’s discretion to retain or dispense with the common law rule). Nearly half of the states have repealed, or limited, the collateral source rule in some manner. Interestingly, even in some cases where the legislature has overturned the collateral source rule, some health insurers have still tried to assert subrogation rights against the plaintiff’s receipt of a tort judgment. Of course, permitting such subrogation would go further than eliminating a windfall to the plaintiff because, if allowed, the plaintiff would not even theoretically be fully compensated. The courts have rebuffed such attempts. <i>See</i> Perreira v. Rediger, 778 A.2d 429 (N.J. 2001) (New Jersey, which legislatively repealed the collateral source rule by permitting defendant to offer evidence of collateral benefits in order to reduce its tort liability, would not recognize any subrogation rights otherwise claimed by health insurer).</p>

With respect to medical malpractice caps on damages, reformers have successfully urged many legislators to limit recovery because our “unrestrained” tort system has driven up health care costs for everyone, caused doctors’ malpractice insurance premiums to go through the roof and resulted in many doctors abandoning practice altogether—or at least in certain “litigation magnet” states. In essence, the argument goes that the combination of our tort common law and the constitutional jury system has conspired to cause a “tort crisis” that demands innovative solutions.</p>

<p id="65ffd239-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are a variety of statutes that limit recovery of actual damages. The majority of these statutes only apply to a narrow category of claims—chiefly medical malpractice suits. The California and Texas statutes set forth below are so limited. The Maryland statute is much broader in this sense as it applies to all personal injury tort claims. Many of the statutes only limit <i>noneconomic general damages</i> while imposing no limits on <i>special economic losses</i>. The Texas medical malpractice wrongful death statute (§74.303), however, limits both general and special damages—as well as exemplary damages—to $500,000.</p>

<p id="6600206d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While all of the damage-limiting statutes are subject to potential interpretational disputes (as are most statutes), the most serious legal questions arising out of these statutes focus upon their legality. Do legislative efforts intended to limit a tort claimant’s recovery of all jury-awarded damages violate the claimant’s constitutional rights? There are several primary constitutional attacks: (1) substantive due process arguments contend that the legislature has acted irrationally by taking away a portion of the plaintiff’s cause of action; (2) equal protection arguments assert that, when the legislature imposes limits on only some personal injury claimants (e.g., medical malpractice victims), the statute violates the claimant’s right to be treated the same as all other personal injury victims; and (3) Seventh Amendment right to jury trial arguments claim that, by superimposing legislative determinations over the actual damages to which a claimant might have recovery, the statutes disregard the jury’s function and render a portion of the jury’s job moot. The courts vary widely regarding these challenges. Sometimes the disagreement concerns whether the court believes there is a true “tort crisis” to justify such legislation. Sometimes the differing legal conclusions of the courts can be attributed to varying levels of judicial scrutiny over legislation. And sometimes the difference in results can be explained by different conceptual views of the jury’s role in our judicial process. Below is a good example of two courts’ reactions to such arguments.<span title="624" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-624">p. 624</span></p>

<p id="66002074-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chief Judge Earl E. O’Connor of the United States District Court for the District of Kansas has certified the following question for resolution: Does K.S.A. 1987 Supp. 60-19a01 violate the Kansas Constitution?</p>
<p id="66002075-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority of our legislature voted to limit the traditional role of the jury to determine the monetary value for loss of the quality of life in Kansas by setting a limit on the recovery of noneconomic damages. The majority of this court recognizes that the legislature’s decision to modify the common law, by setting a limit on noneconomic damages, is a legislative decision that does not violate our state constitution.</p>
<p id="66002076-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A great change in tort doctrine has taken place over the past century. The primary function of damages is no longer seen as deterrence or retribution for harm caused; damages are now seen as compensation. In large part, this shift has been caused by the modern availability of affordable liability insurance, the purchase of which has occasionally been required by legislation.</p>
<p id="66002077-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is the availability of liability insurance which critics warn is threatened by the present tort system. If insurance goes, so will compensation to many plaintiffs, no matter how favorable the laws are in their favor. In reality, “[j]ustice is not achieved when deserved compensation is granted by a court; it is achieved when that compensation is paid to the plaintiff.” <i>Citizens Committee Report</i> 52.</p>
<p id="66002078-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The insurance crisis of the 1970s, referred to in the <i>Citizens Committee Report</i>, was partially caused by the industry’s increased market at lower premiums due to its remarkably high rate of return on investments. The crisis was especially hard-felt in the malpractice insurance area. In response to this crisis and to ensure the continued availability of medical liability insurance, every state enacted some type of tort reform; the statutes number over 300.</p>
<p id="66002079-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the case before this court, the question certified by the United States District Court for the District of Kansas arises out of a personal injury action wherein the plaintiff, Douglas Samsel, claims that one of the defendants, Don Hilgenfeld, negligently caused an automobile accident by driving left of the center line. Samsel was rendered a quadriplegic as a result of this accident. Other defendants are Wheeler Transport Services, Inc., Hilgenfeld’s employer, and Great West Casualty Co., Wheeler’s insurance company. Douglas Samsel is a resident of Kansas; Hilgenfeld of Nebraska. Wheeler has its principal place of business in Nebraska and Great West is organized under Nebraska law. The case was filed in federal court based on diversity of citizenship pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1332 (1982).</p>

<p id="6600478b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The certified question limits our review to an analysis of the Kansas Constitution. The federal court will decide whether the contested statute offends the federal constitution. Specifically, plaintiff argues that the statutory cap violates §§5 and 18 of the Bill of Rights in the Kansas Constitution. Section 5 states: “The right of trial by jury shall be inviolate.” Section 18 is almost as succinct: “All persons, for injuries suffered in person, reputation or property, shall have remedy by due course of law, and justice administered without delay.”</p>
<p id="6600478c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have previously said that §18 protects the right to “reparation for injury, ordered by a tribunal having jurisdiction, in due course of procedure and after a fair hearing.” <i>Ernest v. Faler</i>, 697 P.2d 870 (Kan. 1985).</p>
<p id="6600478d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The certified question requires us to review our state constitution, the role of the common law, legislative and judicial power vis-a-vis the common law, and the separation of powers doctrine. It is also essential that we analyze the doctrine of stare decisis and the consequences of our prior decisions.</p>
<p id="6600478e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our constitution is a written charter enacted by the direct action of the citizens of Kansas. It is a compilation of the fundamental laws of the state and embodies the principles upon which the state government was founded. The object of our constitution is to provide a government of law and not of men, while insuring the protection of life, liberty, and property.</p>
<p id="6600478f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The state constitution establishes the form of our government. Like the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of Kansas contains no express provision requiring the separation of governmental powers, but all decisions of this court have taken for granted the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers between the three branches of the state government—legislative, executive, and judicial.</p>
<p id="66004790-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our constitution does not make this court the critic of the legislature; rather, this court is the guardian of the constitution and every legislative act comes before us with a presumption of constitutionality. A statute will not be declared unconstitutional unless its infringement on the superior law of the constitution is clear, beyond substantial doubt. In determining whether a statute is constitutional, courts must guard against substituting their views on economic or social policy for those of the legislature. Courts are only concerned with the legislative power to enact statutes, not with the wisdom behind those enactments.</p>
<p id="66004791-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The common law can be determined only from decisions in former cases bearing upon the subject under inquiry. As distinguished from statutory or written law, the common law embraces that great body of unwritten law founded upon general custom, usage, or common consent, and based upon natural justice or reason. It may otherwise be defined as custom long acquiesced in or sanctioned by immemorial usage and judicial decision.</p>
<p id="66004792-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our constitution provides that the common-law right to a jury trial includes the right to have the jury determine the amount of the damages in personal <span title="626" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-626">p. 626</span>injury actions. Statutory modification of the common law must meet due process requirements and be reasonably necessary in the public interest to promote the general welfare of the people of the state.</p>
<p id="66006ea3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 5 of the Kansas Bill of Rights protects the right to jury trial as it existed under common law at the time the constitution was adopted. Under the common law, jury verdicts have always been subject to the concurrence of the trial judge and the trial judge’s power to grant a new trial. The right of the trial court and the appellate court to grant a remittitur or a new trial does not violate the individual’s right to a jury trial guaranteed by the United States Constitution. See <i>Capital Traction Co. v. Hof</i>, 174 U.S. 1 (1899).</p>
<p id="66006ea4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A court may refuse to accept a jury’s finding of damages in a personal injury case if, in the light of the evidence, the amount is either so high or so low as to shock the conscience of the court. The court, in such a case, may offer the affected party the opportunity to accept a damage verdict more in line with the evidence. If the party consents to the altered verdict, the party loses the right to appeal as to the amount of damages. If the party refuses to accept the altered verdict, the court may order a new trial, in which the party again faces the court’s discretion to refuse to order damages in the amount found by the jury.</p>
<p id="66006ea5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the Kansas Constitution prohibits the legislature from…limiting recovery for economic or noneconomic losses, this court would have been required to declare the Workers Compensation Act…unconstitutional. We did not. Because we did not, we must now adhere to the doctrine of stare decisis. In the past, we have recognized that the legislature, under its power to act for the general welfare, may alter common-law causes of action.</p>
<p id="66006ea6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statute is a cap only on noneconomic damages and does not limit the court’s power to reduce any other portion of the award it deems excessive. The duty of a court to protect parties from unjust verdicts arising from ignorance of the rules of law and of evidence, from impulse of passion or prejudice, or from any other violation of their lawful rights in the conduct of the trial is still maintained. <i>Pleasants v. Fant</i>, 89 U.S. 116 (1875).</p>
<p id="66006ea7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Denying those with the greatest pain and suffering a full remedy in order to ease insurance rates for those who cause injury was considered and approved by a majority of the legislature. The legislature is aware that the cap on noneconomic loss will affect the right to recover by those most severely injured in Kansas. Laws that restrict those who suffer the greatest pain, mental anguish, and disfigurement from a case-by-case determination of individual damages by jury are harsh. However, our determination is that, under proper circumstances, the legislature may limit recovery of noneconomic losses of those individuals whose quality of life has been most affected.</p>
<p id="66006ea8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To be consistent with our prior decisions…the answer to the certified question is that K.S.A. 1988 Supp. 60-19a01 [does] not violate §5 (right to a jury) or §18 (right to due course of law for injuries suffered) of the Kansas Bill of Rights.</p>

With regard to the right to a jury trial, why do the two courts disagree? With regard to the due process arguments, is the difference between the two decisions more because of disparate views over the existence of a tort crisis or because of the degree to which they were each willing to scrutinize the wisdom behind the legislation?</p>
<p id="66010b19-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Debate over Tort Crisis.</i></b> Beginning in the 1970s, renewed in the 1980s, and repeated in the first decade of the twenty first century have been cries by business and insurance interests of a “tort crisis” demanding reforms to limit juries’ abilities to award large damages in tort cases. Whether such a crisis has ever really existed is the subject of much scholarly debate. <i>See e.g.</i>, Michael A. Allen, <i>A Survey and Some Commentary on Federal “Tort Reform,”</i> 39 Akron L. Rev. 909 (2006); Michael J. Saks, <i>Do We Really Know Anything About the Behavior of the Tort Litigation System—And Why Not?</i>, 140 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1147 (1992); Johnson, <i>The Attack on Trial Lawyers and Tort Law</i>, A Commonwealth Institute Report (2003). Perhaps the poster child for a need for tort reform was the McDonald’s hot coffee case where media reports on the multi-million dollar jury award were widely disseminated and repeated. The jury verdict became a punch line for many late-night comedians and the inspiration for an episode of <i>Seinfeld</i>. A recent HBO documentary entitled <i>Hot Coffee</i> attempted to debunk many of the perceived myths commonly held by the public regarding this case. Ironically, one possible unintended consequence of the media-driven tort reform movement might be to cause juries to <i>increase</i> their awards of damages. One empirical study of juror behavior found a correlation between jurors’ belief in the frequency of million-dollar verdicts and their willingness to similarly award at least a million dollars in actual damages.

On September 8, 1950, defendant without her permission employed a tree surgery company to go upon plaintiff’s property and top three cedar trees. The trees were located some two or three feet north of plaintiff’s south boundary line. The trees before being topped were 20 to 25 feet high, and were as she wanted them on her property. About 10 feet were cut off the tops of the trees, and from such topping the trees would never grow any higher, and she didn’t want them to stop growing. Cedars are not pruned from the top, but are feathered and shaped and not cropped. She considered the trees were, in effect, destroyed by improper pruning. She attached a sentimental value to them as they stood; they served a special purpose, were both shade and ornamental trees and were worth $150 to $200 each.</p>

The work consisted of cutting out dead branches and cleaning out bagworms. One of defendant’s expert witnesses testified on direct examination that the cutting away of dead wood would not injure the physical condition of the tree. However, on cross-examination he testified that if the top is taken out, it is the ambition of every bud on the tree to try to take the place of the terminal bud which has been sacrificed, but the trunk itself is no longer going to grow in height.

There is a legal injury brought about by intentional conduct and for this the law affords a remedy at least in the form of nominal damages. In a world of crowded court dockets, what sense does this make? One justification offered relates to permitting nominal recovery if only to declare the rights of the respective parties in the event of later disputes:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="66018065-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, the allowance of nominal damages is generally based on the ground either that every injury from its very nature legally imports damage, or that the injury complained of would in the future be evidence in favor of the wrongdoer, where, if continued for a sufficient length of time, the invasion of the plaintiff’s rights would ripen into a prescriptive right in favor of the defendant. The maxim “de minimis non curat lex” [the law cares not about trifles] will not preclude the award of nominal damages in such cases. However, if there is no danger of prescription, no proof of substantial loss or injury, or willful wrongdoing by the defendant, it <span title="635" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-635">p. 635</span>has been said that there is no purpose for allowing nominal damages, and judgment should be rendered for the defendant.</p></div>

Accordingly, one can fairly safely assume that any intentional tort (except for a harmless intermeddling as discussed under Trespass to Chattels in Chapter 2) should at least give rise to a <i>possible</i> claim for nominal damages. On the other hand, courts would dismiss a case for negligence where the misconduct inflicted no harm, as there is no purpose to be served in awarding nominal damages where the defendant’s carelessness amounted to “negligence in the air.”</p>
<p id="66018067-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Other Motivations for Seeking Nominal Damages.</i></b> Beyond vindicating her rights, why else might a “victim” of an intentional tort bother to sue for nominal damages? One reason might be to have a court rule upon a legal issue in which the parties have some interest. Setting precedent might be enormously valuable in one setting even if it first arose in a seemingly minor case for nominal damages. Further, when one’s constitutional rights are violated, courts have sometimes declared a plaintiff who has proven a technical violation and recovered nominal damages to be the “prevailing party” under civil rights statutes that also permit such party to recover attorney’s fees from the defendant. Sometimes awards of attorney’s fees can be quite substantial and can offer some deterrent to the defendant continuing to engage in such misconduct. There have also been instances of juries awarding punitive damages on top of a nominal damage award, though this practice is prohibited in some states and has suspect continued validity in light of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408 (2003), discussed in the next section.</p>

<p id="6601a77a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While compensating victims—making them “whole” as much as money ever can—is the common refrain used to describe the primary purpose of actual damage awards, an award of punitive or exemplary damages is very different in purpose. A punitive damage award is considered “extraordinary” and is used only to provide additional punishment and deterrence for the egregious conduct in which the defendant engaged. Such an award is “additional” because even an award of actual damages provides some level of punishment and deterrence. Forcing someone to pay for harms caused is a negative consequence for having hurt another. But the thought is that the transfer of money to cover the harms may be sufficient to compensate or reimburse the plaintiff but may not be enough of a punishment for the wrongdoer. Plaintiffs’ lawyers making closing arguments in punitive damage cases talk about “sending a message” to the defendant that its conduct will not be tolerated any longer. They advocate for the award to be large enough so that the defendant will remember the severe <span title="636" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-636">p. 636</span>consequences the next time the defendant is tempted to repeat its antisocial behavior.

<p id="6601a77f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have already spent considerable time exploring expansion and contraction in tort law based upon waxing and waning sentiment regarding the degree to which the law fulfills its purposes of compensating, deterring, and punishing, balanced against providing windfall recoveries for plaintiffs with runaway jury verdicts of excessive damages. These same debates often focus upon awards of punitive damages because, while they are not routinely handed out in most tort cases, the headlines regarding particularly large exemplary damage awards can garner much attention. Large punitive damage awards may be hard to justify at times because of the reality that such an award is truly a windfall to the victim who has already received the law’s best estimate of full compensatory damages, and then may also receive a punitive award many times greater than his actual damages.</p>
<p id="6601a780-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The other aspect of punitive damage law that makes it a natural center of legal debate is that it occupies a gray land somewhere between the civil and criminal sides of our justice system. Criminal law places its primary focus upon retribution—punishing unlawful conduct in a way that satisfies citizens and makes it less likely that criminal behavior will be repeated. While that is criminal law’s primary focus, judges frequently also enter judgments in criminal law cases requiring the convicted criminal to make restitution payments to compensate their victims. Overlap exists between these two worlds in two places—in criminal cases when restitution is required and in civil cases when punitive damages are awarded. But the punitive damage context is where the controversy exists because civil cases do not offer the same heightened constitutional protections for citizens accused of crimes—the constitutional rights to counsel, to not have to testify against oneself, and for the prosecution to have to prove the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Is it appropriate to award potentially large “fines” in the form of punitive damages in a civil case without such procedural protections? These concerns underlie various legal issues that abound in recent tort cases where punitive damages are being considered.</p>

<p id="6601ce9c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff instituted this civil action on 5 January 1979 seeking damages for injuries allegedly caused by an assault and battery committed by defendant. At trial defendant duly moved to dismiss plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages on the ground that plaintiff had failed properly to plead or prove such claim. The trial judge denied these motions and submitted to the jury the issues of liability, punitive damages, and compensatory damages.</p>
<p id="6601ce9d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff’s evidence tended to show that on 19 October 1978 around 9:25 a.m. he entered the defendant’s restaurant in Tarboro known as “Cotton’s Grill” for the purpose of joining several regular customers for coffee. After serving himself a cup of coffee, he joined the group. Plaintiff moved toward the table where the men sat without paying for his cup of coffee. Defendant was seated at the table, and as plaintiff took a seat at the table, he said to defendant, “This cup of coffee is on the house.” Plaintiff then told defendant to “charge it against the formica that you owe me for.”</p>
<p id="6601ce9e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff’s remarks were in reference to a dispute between himself and defendant regarding a piece of formica that a contractor had removed from a job at plaintiff’s place of business with his permission to use it in the completion of a job at defendant’s restaurant in March, 1978. Plaintiff had billed defendant twice for the formica, but the $6.25 bill remained unpaid at the time of the October 1978 incident. Defendant had refused to pay for the formica and had in turn sent plaintiff a bill for what defendant claimed was lost time for a painter who had been conversing with plaintiff while he was working on a job for defendant. Plaintiff had not honored defendant’s request to reimburse him for the painter’s lost time although defendant had offered to pay plaintiff for the formica after plaintiff had paid defendant for the claimed lost time.</p>

Plaintiff responded by saying, “Make me.” Defendant then picked plaintiff up in a “bear hug” and started toward the door. Plaintiff managed to free himself and blows were exchanged. Plaintiff was struck about the eyes twice, and defendant’s glasses were broken <span title="638" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-638">p. 638</span>when he was hit in the face during the scuffle.

<p id="6601cea4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rationale permitting recovery of punitive damages is that such damages may be awarded in addition to compensatory damages to punish a defendant for his wrongful acts and to deter others from committing similar acts. A civil action may not be maintained solely for the purpose of collecting punitive damages but may only be awarded when a cause of action otherwise exists in which at least nominal damages are recoverable by the plaintiff. <i>Worthy v. Knight</i>, 187 S.E. 771 (N.C. 1936).</p>
<p id="6601cea5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is well established in this jurisdiction that punitive damages may be recovered for an assault and battery but are allowable <i>only</i> when the assault and battery is accompanied by an element of aggravation such as malice, or oppression, or gross and wilful wrong, or a wanton and reckless disregard of plaintiff’s rights. <i>Oestreicher v. American Nat. Stores, Inc.</i>, 225 S.E.2d 797 (N.C. 1976).</p>
<p id="6601f5b6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some jurisdictions permit the recovery of punitive damages on the theory of <i>implied</i> or <i>imputed</i> malice when a person intentionally does an act which naturally tends to be injurious. These jurisdictions thus infer the malice necessary to support recovery of punitive damages from <i>any</i> assault and battery. <i>Barker v. James</i>, 486 P.2d 195 (Ariz. 1971); <i>Robbs v. Missouri Pac. Ry. Co.</i>, 242 S.W. 155 (Mo. 1922); <i>Custer v. Kroeger</i>, 209 Mo. App. 450, 240 S.W. 241 (1922); <i>Mecham v. Foley</i>, 235 P.2d 497 (Utah 1951). We do not adhere to this rule. To justify the awarding of punitive damages in North Carolina, there must be a showing of <i>actual</i> or <i>express</i> malice, that is, a showing of a sense of personal ill will toward the plaintiff which activated or incited a defendant to commit the alleged assault and battery. <i>Baker v. Winslow</i>, 113 S.E. 570 (N.C. 1922).</p>
<p id="6601f5b7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[In reviewing the punitive damage award here, we] find it helpful to review the <i>types</i> of cases in which punitive damages have been allowed. Punitive damages were recovered in cases where a clergyman while peacefully walking down a street was attacked by the defendant and severely injured; where the plaintiff while eating in a hotel dining room was compelled to sign a retraction by a show of violence, accompanied with offensive and threatening language; <span title="639" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-639">p. 639</span>where defendant assaulted a weak and old person with a stick loaded with lead for the reason that defendant <i>thought</i> plaintiff was a trespasser; [and] where a twelve-year-old boy was assaulted in public in the presence of others without justification or excuse. We note that all of these cases contain a thread of unprovoked humiliating assaults, assaults on children, assaults on weaker persons, or assaults where a deadly weapon was callously used.

<p id="6601f5b8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case of <i>Riepe v. Green</i>, 65 S.W.2d 667 (Mo. App. 1933), is most instructive toward decision because of its strong factual similarity to the case before us. There plaintiff brought a civil action against defendant seeking compensatory and punitive damages. The evidence of the plaintiff disclosed that there had been some difficulty between plaintiff and defendant and that plaintiff “had no good feeling toward him (defendant) for over a year.” <i>Id.</i> at 668. On the day that the incident complained of occurred, defendant was talking to some men on the street when plaintiff called him and asked “have you found any more victims?” Plaintiff then drove his wagon across the sidewalk so that defendant could not move. After some further conversation, plaintiff told defendant that he did not want any dealings with him because of his refusal to pay for some cow pasture. Plaintiff testified that he might have called defendant an “S.O.B.” and a damned crook. Thereafter, a fight ensued which resulted in plaintiff’s alleged injuries. The jury answered issues awarding plaintiff compensatory and punitive damages, and defendant appealed. In reversing and remanding, the Kansas City Court of Appeals reasoned:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="6601f5b9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The general rule, as to punitive damages, is to the effect that the question is one for the jury and not for the court. This general rule is predicated upon the presumption that wantonness, recklessness, oppression, or express malice be shown by some fact or circumstance in evidence from which one of these elements may be inferred. (Citation omitted.)</p>
<p id="6601f5ba-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We fail to find any evidence in the record before us that justifies the submission of the issue of punitive damages. In so far as words and conduct could provoke such a state of mind as above, the plaintiff is shown to be the aggressor. One who drives a wagon across the pathway of another with the intent expressed by plaintiff furnishes a poor subject for smart money. While foul words and epithets do not justify assault, yet such words and epithets mitigate, and, in the absence of any showing that defendant was actuated by willfull, wanton, and malicious state of mind, it was error to submit the issue of punitive damages.</p></div>

<p id="6601f5bc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying the above-stated principles of law to the facts presented by this appeal, we conclude that the evidence presented was not sufficient to permit the jury reasonably to infer that defendant’s actions were activated by personal ill will toward plaintiff or that his acts were aggravated by oppression, insult, rudeness, or a wanton and reckless disregard of plaintiff’s rights. To the contrary, the evidence shows that two adults acting as adolescents engaged in an affray which <span title="640" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-640">p. 640</span>was precipitated by plaintiff’s “baiting” of defendant and plaintiff’s invitation that he be ejected from defendant’s premises.

Rather, in most jurisdictions the plaintiff must prove—in addition to the elements of the intentional tort—aggravating circumstances referred to as “malice.” A minority of courts assume this bad intent when an intentional tort is proven. The problem with this approach is that many intentional torts might not involve any ill will (for example, a simple trespass where the defendant has taken a shortcut across the landowner’s property).</p>
<p id="6601f5c0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Nominal Damages as Anchor.</i></b> Some courts have permitted punitive damage claims when the defendant’s intentional tort was coupled with “malice” despite the fact that no actual harm was caused, so long as there was an award of at least nominal damages. <i>See e.g.</i>, Peete v. Blackwell, 504 So. 2d 222 (Ala. 1986) (upholding award of $10,000 in punitive damages where angry doctor struck the arm of a nurse during an emergency procedure despite the fact that the jury only awarded $1 in nominal damages). This practice is called into serious question both by constitutional due process issues (<i>see</i> State Farm v.

<p id="66021cd7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to a showing of “malice” accompanying the commission of an intentional tort, most courts have also recognized reckless misconduct (or gross negligence) as an additional path to punitive damages. In Chapter 3, we explored gross negligence as an alternative standard to ordinary negligence in <i>Mobil Oil v. Ellender</i>. In that case, the court discussed the two-pronged nature of a showing of gross negligence: (1) that, viewed objectively, the defendant’s conduct created a substantial <i>probability</i> of <i>serious danger</i> to the plaintiff; and (2) that the defendant had a subjective awareness of the risk of harm arising from its actions but made the conscious decision to disregard this risk. Many cases of gross negligence arise in the corporate context, such as <i>Mobil Oil</i>. In such cases, courts have to determine precisely <i>whose reckless misconduct</i> suffices to justify punishing the corporate entity. In other words, when does the reckless misconduct of an employee count as recklessness by the corporation itself? Below is an additional excerpt from <i>Mobil Oil</i> discussing and applying the gross negligence standard to a punitive damage award in the corporate context.</p>

Because a corporation can “act only through agents of some character,” <i>Fort Worth Elevators</i>, 70 S.W.2d at 402, this Court has developed tests for distinguishing between acts that are solely attributable to agents or employees and acts that are directly attributable to the corporation. <i>See Hammerly Oaks, Inc. v.

Instead, the court should review all the surrounding facts and circumstances to determine whether the corporation itself is grossly negligent.

Moreover, Mobil did not include any reference to benzene or other chemicals in its 1967 pamphlet entitled “Mobil Safety and Security Regulations for Contract Workers.” Dr. Josh Esslinger, a former medical consultant for Mobil in Beaumont, testified that he knew workers washed their hands in benzene and that such a practice indicated that workers were not adequately warned of benzene hazards.

<p id="660242fa-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Gross Negligence as Basis for Punitive Damages.</i></b> While the vast majority of courts have traditionally accepted the possibility of a jury’s award of punitive damages in accidental injury cases where the defendant’s conduct amounts to gross negligence, reckless, or “wilful and wantonness,” a minority of courts have dismissed this possibility—instead insisting on a showing of “actual malice” as a motivation for the wrongful conduct as the needed threshold. <i>See e.g.</i>, Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Zenobia, 601 A.2d 633 (Md. 1992) (rejecting gross negligence as a basis for punitive damages and instead insisting upon a finding of “evil motive, intent to injure, ill will, or fraud, i.e., ‘actual malice.’”).</p>
<p id="660242fb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Gross Negligence of the Corporation Itself.</i></b> An artificial legal entity, such as a corporation, can only act through its employees and agents. But just because one of those employees has engaged in misconduct warranting punitive damages does not automatically mean the corporation should be punished. In the next chapter on Apportionment, we will discuss vicarious liability—a type of guilt by association—for actual damages. But the ease by which a corporation might be liable for its employees’ ordinary negligence in a suit for compensatory damages does not apply to exemplary damages. In <i>Mobil</i>, the court acknowledges various bases for corporate liability for punitive damages—authorization or ratification of the employees’ malicious or grossly negligent conduct, or where the bad-acting employee is part of management, as a <i>vice principal.</i> The court also mentions the gross negligence in hiring a bad-acting employee as a basis for corporate liability for punitive damages, but this is redundant because such conduct would necessarily involve the gross negligence of a vice principal.</p>

We will discuss each of these types of limits in order. In State Farm Insurance v.

<p id="66026a1b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For centuries, federal courts have left the world of punitive damages to the control of state common law.

In <i>State Farm</i>, the Court applies this new constitutional standard to a rather large award against an insurer whose conduct “merits no praise.” The issue was whether the state court jury had doled out an excessive punishment in its exemplary damage award.</p>

He decided to pass six vans traveling ahead of them on a two-lane highway. Todd Ospital was driving a small car approaching from the opposite direction. To avoid a head-on collision with Campbell, who by then was driving on the wrong side of the highway and toward oncoming traffic, Ospital swerved onto the shoulder, lost control of his automobile, and collided with a vehicle driven by Robert G. Slusher. Ospital was killed, and Slusher was rendered permanently disabled. The Campbells escaped unscathed.</p>

<p id="66029138-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the ensuing wrongful death and tort action, Campbell insisted he was not at fault. Early investigations did support differing conclusions as to who caused the accident, but [the investigators quickly agreed that Campbell’s unsafe pass caused the crash]. Campbell’s insurance company, State Farm, nonetheless decided to contest liability and declined offers by Slusher and Ospital’s estate to settle the claims for the policy limit of $50,000. State Farm also ignored the advice of one of its own investigators and took the case to trial, assuring the Campbells that [their assets were safe, that they had no liability for the accident, and that State Farm would take care of them so they need not hire their own separate counsel]. To the contrary, a jury determined that Campbell was 100 percent at fault, and a judgment was returned for $185,849, far more than the amount offered in settlement.</p>
<p id="66029139-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At first State Farm refused to cover the $135,849 in excess liability. Its counsel made this clear to the Campbells: “You may want to put for sale signs on your property to get things moving.” Nor was State Farm willing to post a supersedeas bond to allow Campbell to appeal the judgment against him. Campbell obtained his own counsel to appeal the verdict. During the pendency of the appeal, in late 1984, Slusher, Ospital, and the Campbells reached an agreement whereby Slusher and Ospital agreed not to seek satisfaction of their claims against the Campbells. In exchange the Campbells agreed to pursue a bad faith action against State Farm and to be represented by Slusher’s and Ospital’s attorneys. The Campbells also agreed that Slusher and Ospital would have a right to play a part in all major decisions concerning the bad faith action. No settlement could be concluded without Slusher’s and Ospital’s approval, and Slusher and Ospital would receive 90 percent of any verdict against State Farm.</p>

<p id="6602913a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1989, the Utah Supreme Court denied Campbell’s appeal in the wrongful death and tort actions. State Farm then paid the entire judgment, including the amounts in excess of the policy limits. The Campbells nonetheless filed a complaint against State Farm alleging bad faith, fraud, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. State Farm moved <i>in limine</i> to exclude evidence of alleged conduct that occurred in unrelated cases outside of Utah, but the trial court denied the motion. At State Farm’s request the trial court bifurcated the trial into two phases conducted before different juries. In the first phase the jury determined that State Farm’s decision not to settle was unreasonable because there was a substantial likelihood of an excess verdict.</p>
<p id="6602913b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before the second phase of the action against State Farm we decided <i>BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore</i>, 517 U.S. 559 (1996), and refused to sustain a $2 million punitive damages award which accompanied a verdict of only $4,000 in compensatory damages. Based on that decision, State Farm again moved for the exclusion of evidence of dissimilar out-of-state conduct. The trial court denied State Farm’s motion.</p>
<p id="6602913c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second phase addressed State Farm’s liability for fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress, as well as compensatory and punitive damages. The Utah Supreme Court aptly characterized this phase of the trial:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="6602913d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">State Farm argued during phase II that its decision to take the case to trial was an ‘honest mistake’ that did not warrant punitive damages. In contrast, the Campbells introduced evidence that State Farm’s decision to take the case to trial was a result of a national scheme to meet corporate fiscal goals by capping payouts on claims company wide. To prove the existence of this scheme, the trial court allowed the Campbells to introduce extensive expert testimony regarding fraudulent practices by State Farm in its nation-wide operations. Although State Farm moved prior to phase II of the trial for the exclusion of such evidence and continued to object to it at trial, the trial court ruled that such evidence was admissible to determine whether State Farm’s conduct in the Campbell case was indeed intentional and sufficiently egregious to warrant punitive damages.</p></div>
<p id="6602b84e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Evidence pertaining to the [scheme] concerned State Farm’s business practices for over 20 years in numerous States. Most of these practices bore no relation to third-party automobile insurance claims, the type of claim underlying the Campbells’ complaint against the company. The jury awarded the Campbells $2.6 million in compensatory damages and $145 million in punitive damages, which the trial court reduced to $1 million and $25 million respectively. Both parties appealed.</p>
<p id="6602b84f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Utah Supreme Court [reinstated the $145 million punitive damage verdict. State Farm appealed from the judgment of $1 million in actual damages and $145 million in punitive damages].</p>
<p id="6602b850-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We recognized in <i>Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc.</i>, 532 U.S. 424 (2001), that in our judicial system compensatory and punitive damages, although usually awarded at the same time by the same decisionmaker, serve <span title="647" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-647">p. 647</span>different purposes. Compensatory damages “are intended to redress the concrete loss that the plaintiff has suffered by reason of the defendant’s wrongful conduct.” By contrast, punitive damages serve a broader function; they are aimed at deterrence and retribution. See <i>Gore, supra</i>, at 568 (“Punitive damages may properly be imposed to further a State’s legitimate interests in punishing unlawful conduct and deterring its repetition”).</p>
<p id="6602b851-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While States possess discretion over the imposition of punitive damages, it is well established that there are procedural and substantive constitutional limitations on these awards. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the imposition of grossly excessive or arbitrary punishments on a tortfeasor. The reason is that “elementary notions of fairness enshrined in our constitutional jurisprudence dictate that a person receive fair notice not only of the conduct that will subject him to punishment, but also of the severity of the penalty that a State may impose.” <i>Id.</i>, at 574. To the extent an award is grossly excessive, it furthers no legitimate purpose and constitutes an arbitrary deprivation of property. <i>Haslip</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 42 (O’Connor, J., dissenting) (“Punitive damages are a powerful weapon. Imposed wisely and with restraint, they have the potential to advance legitimate state interests. Imposed indiscriminately, however, they have a devastating potential for harm. Regrettably, common-law procedures for awarding punitive damages fall into the latter category”).</p>
<p id="6602b852-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although these awards serve the same purposes as criminal penalties, defendants subjected to punitive damages in civil cases have not been accorded the protections applicable in a criminal proceeding. This increases our concerns over the imprecise manner in which punitive damages systems are administered. We have admonished that “punitive damages pose an acute danger of arbitrary deprivation of property. Jury instructions typically leave the jury with wide discretion in choosing amounts, and the presentation of evidence of a defendant’s net worth creates the potential that juries will use their verdicts to express biases against big businesses, particularly those without strong local presences.” <i>Honda Motor, supra</i>, at 432.</p>
<p id="6602b853-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In light of these concerns, in Gore we instructed courts reviewing punitive damages to consider three guideposts: (1) the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant’s misconduct; (2) the disparity between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award; and (3) the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.</p>
<p id="6602b854-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the principles outlined in <i>BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore</i>, this case is neither close nor difficult. It was error to reinstate the jury’s $145 million punitive damages award. We address each guidepost of <i>Gore</i> in some detail.</p>
<p id="6602b855-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“[T]he most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award is the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant’s conduct.” <i>Gore</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 575. We have instructed courts to determine the reprehensibility of a defendant by considering whether: the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic; the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a <span title="648" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-648">p. 648</span>reckless disregard of the health or safety of others; the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability; the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident; and the harm was the result of intentional malice, trickery, or deceit, or mere accident. It should be presumed a plaintiff has been made whole for his injuries by compensatory damages, so punitive damages should only be awarded if the defendant’s culpability, after having paid compensatory damages, is so reprehensible as to warrant the imposition of further sanctions to achieve punishment or deterrence.</p>
<p id="6602b856-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying these factors in the instant case, we must acknowledge that State Farm’s handling of the claims against the Campbells merits no praise. The trial court found that State Farm’s employees altered the company’s records to make Campbell appear less culpable. State Farm disregarded the overwhelming likelihood of liability and the near-certain probability that, by taking the case to trial, a judgment in excess of the policy limits would be awarded. State Farm amplified the harm by at first assuring the Campbells their assets would be safe from any verdict and by later telling them, postjudgment, to put a for-sale sign on their house. While we do not suggest there was error in awarding punitive damages based upon State Farm’s conduct toward the Campbells, a more modest punishment for this reprehensible conduct could have satisfied the State’s legitimate objectives, and the Utah courts should have gone no further.</p>
<p id="6602b857-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case, instead, was used as a platform to expose, and punish, the perceived deficiencies of State Farm’s operations throughout the country. The Utah Supreme Court’s opinion makes explicit that State Farm was being condemned for its nationwide policies rather than for the conduct direct toward the Campbells.</p>
<p id="6602b858-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Campbells contend that State Farm has only itself to blame for the reliance upon dissimilar and out-of-state conduct evidence. The record does not support this contention. From their opening statements onward the Campbells framed this case as a chance to rebuke State Farm for its nationwide activities. (“You’re going to hear evidence that even the insurance commission in Utah and around the country are unwilling or inept at protecting people against abuses.”) This was a position maintained throughout the litigation.</p>
<p id="6602df69-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A State cannot punish a defendant for conduct that may have been lawful where it occurred. Nor, as a general rule, does a State have a legitimate concern in imposing punitive damages to punish a defendant for unlawful acts committed outside of the State’s jurisdiction. Any proper adjudication of conduct that occurred outside Utah to other persons would require their inclusion, and, to those parties, the Utah courts, in the usual case, would need to apply the laws of their relevant jurisdiction.</p>
<p id="6602df6a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For a more fundamental reason, however, the Utah courts erred in relying upon this and other evidence: The courts awarded punitive damages to punish and deter conduct that bore no relation to the Campbells’ harm. A defendant’s dissimilar acts, independent from the acts upon which liability was premised, may not serve as the basis for punitive damages. A defendant should be punished for the conduct that harmed the plaintiff, not for being an unsavory <span title="649" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-649">p. 649</span>individual or business. Due process does not permit courts, in the calculation of punitive damages, to adjudicate the merits of other parties’ hypothetical claims against a defendant under the guise of the reprehensibility analysis, but we have no doubt the Utah Supreme Court did that here. Punishment on these bases creates the possibility of multiple punitive damages awards for the same conduct; for in the usual case nonparties are not bound by the judgment some other plaintiff obtains.</p>
<p id="6602df6b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The same reasons lead us to conclude the Utah Supreme Court’s decision cannot be justified on the grounds that State Farm was a recidivist. Although “our holdings that a recidivist may be punished more severely than a first offender recognize that repeated misconduct is more reprehensible than an individual instance of malfeasance,” <i>Gore</i>, at 577, in the context of civil actions courts must ensure the conduct in question replicates the prior transgressions.</p>
<p id="6602df6c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Campbells have identified scant evidence of repeated misconduct of the sort that injured them. Nor does our review of the Utah courts’ decisions convince us that State Farm was only punished for its actions toward the Campbells. Although evidence of other acts need not be identical to have relevance in the calculation of punitive damages, the Utah court erred here because evidence pertaining to claims that had nothing to do with a third-party lawsuit was introduced at length. For example, the Utah Supreme Court criticized State Farm’s investigation into the personal life of one of its employees and, in a broader approach, the manner in which State Farm’s policies corrupted its employees. The reprehensibility guidepost does not permit courts to expand the scope of the case so that a defendant may be punished for any malfeasance, which in this case extended for a 20-year period. In this case, because the Campbells have shown no conduct by State Farm similar to that which harmed them, the conduct that harmed them is the only conduct relevant to the reprehensibility analysis.</p>
<p id="6602df6d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Turning to the second <i>Gore</i> guidepost, we have been reluctant to identify concrete constitutional limits on the ratio between harm, or potential harm, to the plaintiff and the punitive damages award. We decline again to impose a bright-line ratio which a punitive damages award cannot exceed. Our jurisprudence and the principles it has now established demonstrate, however, that, in practice, few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will satisfy due process. In <i>Haslip</i>, in upholding a punitive damages award, we concluded that an award of more than four times the amount of compensatory damages might be close to the line of constitutional impropriety. We cited that 4-to-1 ratio again in <i>Gore</i>. The Court further referenced a long legislative history, dating back over 700 years and going forward to today, providing for sanctions of double, treble, or quadruple damages to deter and punish. While these ratios are not binding, they are instructive. They demonstrate what should be obvious: Single-digit multipliers are more likely to comport with due process, while still achieving the State’s goals of deterrence and retribution, than awards with ratios in range of 500 to 1, or, in this case, of 145 to 1.</p>
<span title="650" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-650">p. 650</span>
<p id="6602df6e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nonetheless, because there are no rigid benchmarks that a punitive damages award may not surpass, ratios greater than those we have previously upheld may comport with due process where “a particularly egregious act has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages.” The converse is also true, however. When compensatory damages are substantial, then a lesser ratio, perhaps only equal to compensatory damages, can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee. The precise award in any case, of course, must be based upon the facts and circumstances of the defendant’s conduct and the harm to the plaintiff.</p>
<p id="6602df6f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, courts must ensure that the measure of punishment is both reasonable and proportionate to the amount of harm to the plaintiff and to the general damages recovered. In the context of this case, we have no doubt that there is a presumption against an award that has a 145-to-1 ratio. The compensatory award in this case was substantial; the Campbells were awarded $1 million for a year and a half of emotional distress. This was complete compensation. The harm arose from a transaction in the economic realm, not from some physical assault or trauma; there were no physical injuries; and State Farm paid the excess verdict before the complaint was filed, so the Campbells suffered only minor economic injuries for the 18-month period in which State Farm refused to resolve the claim against them. The compensatory damages for the injury suffered here, moreover, likely were based on a component which was duplicated in the punitive award. Much of the distress was caused by the outrage and humiliation the Campbells suffered at the actions of their insurer; and it is a major role of punitive damages to condemn such conduct. Compensatory damages, however, already contain this punitive element.</p>
<p id="6602df70-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The third guidepost in <i>Gore</i> is the disparity between the punitive damages award and the “civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.”</p>
<p id="6602df71-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, we need not dwell long on this guidepost. The most relevant civil sanction under Utah state law for the wrong done to the Campbells appears to be a $10,000 fine for an act of fraud, an amount dwarfed by the $145 million punitive damages award. The Supreme Court of Utah speculated about the loss of State Farm’s business license, the disgorgement of profits, and possible imprisonment, but here again its references were to the broad fraudulent scheme drawn from evidence of out-of-state and dissimilar conduct. This analysis was insufficient to justify the award.</p>
<p id="66030682-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An application of the <i>Gore</i> guideposts to the facts of this case, especially in light of the substantial compensatory damages awarded (a portion of which contained a punitive element), likely would justify a punitive damages award at or near the amount of compensatory damages. The punitive award of $145 million, therefore, was neither reasonable nor proportionate to the wrong committed, and it was an irrational and arbitrary deprivation of the property of the defendant. The proper calculation of punitive damages under the principles we have discussed should be resolved, in the first instance, by the Utah courts.</p>
<p id="66030683-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judgment of the Utah Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>

Today’s decision exhibits no such respect and restraint. No longer content to accord state-court judgments “a strong presumption of validity,” <i>TXO</i>, 509 U.S. at 457, the Court announces that “few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will satisfy due process.” In a legislative scheme or a state high court’s design to cap punitive damages, the handiwork in setting single-digit and 1-to-1 benchmarks could hardly be questioned; in a judicial decree imposed on the States by this Court under the banner of substantive due process, the numerical controls today’s decision installs seem to me boldly out of order.</p>

The amount of an award must not reflect bias, prejudice, or sympathy toward any party. However, the amount can be as large as you believe necessary to fulfill the purposes of punitive damages.

Neither, therefore, has had any work history, making it necessary for damages purposes to predict what each plaintiff’s future earnings would have been if the accident hadn’t happened. Prediction also is necessary as to actual future earnings in light of the disabilities suffered from the accident. Neither side suggested that either plaintiff would likely become a member of the professions or work in a managerial or entrepreneurial capacity. Thus, each side, in submitting opinions as to the vocational future of the plaintiffs, assumed that each would enter the workforce at 19, upon completion of high school. Plaintiffs’ experts, in predicting a skilled worker future, assumed a four-year apprenticeship period, with, thereafter, a 42-year journeyman career in effect, assuming retirement from the workforce at age 65. Defendant’s expert made similar assumptions, except that defendant did not agree that either plaintiff would have become a member of a skilled craft.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="65fa5402-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10140_a395957d-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d" id="note-N10140_a395957d-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d">3</a></span>&nbsp;Each side recognized, of course, the necessity to reduce to present value the projected stream of lost future earnings. The method may be stated simply. The estimator (fact finder) must predict what inflation will occur in the wage rate during the working lifetime of each plaintiff and what return (or interest) could be earned from investment of the lump sum award over that same period. The fact finder then must calculate the amount of an award that would return a stream of earnings over the plaintiff’s working lifetime equal to the amount of earnings that the plaintiff will lose over that period as a result of his injury. In simple, non-expert lingo, the higher the assumed rate of investment return (interest) compared to the assumed rate of wage inflation, the lower is the present lump-sum amount of the award. Conversely, the lower the assumed rate of investment return (discount to present value) compared to the assumed rate of wage inflation, the higher is the present lump-sum amount of the award. If the assumed interest rate is equal to the assumed wage inflation rate, then no adjustment to ascertain present value is necessary. It is not entirely surprising, therefore, that plaintiffs’ experts expressed opinions calling for the use of factors producing large present-day amounts, and that defendant’s experts expressed opinions calling for the use of factors producing small present-day amounts.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="65fd6173-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10950_a395957d-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d" id="note-N10950_a395957d-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d">4</a></span>&nbsp;Lord Byron, <i>Inscription on the Monument of a Newfoundland Dog</i>, in 7 The Works of Lord Byron: with His Letters and Journals, and His Life 292-93 n.2 (Thomas Moore ed., 1832).</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="65fd6177-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10967_a395957d-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d" id="note-N10967_a395957d-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d">5</a></span>&nbsp;<i>See Russell v.

As to both kinds of insurance it has been stated: ‘Such a policy is an investment contract, giving the owner or beneficiary an absolute right, independent of the right against any third person responsible for the injury covered by the policy.’ An insurer who fully compensates the insured, however, is subrogated to the rights of the insured against [or may receive a refund of benefits from] one who insured his property if the insurance was for the protection of the property of the insured, and was therefore an indemnity contract. In such cases subrogation [or refund of benefits] is the means by which double recovery by the owner is prevented and the ultimate burden shifted to the wrongdoer where it belongs.” <i>Anheuser-Busch, Inc.</i> v. <i>Starley, supra</i>, 28 Cal. 2d 347, 355 (dissenting op. of Traynor, J.). One Court of Appeal has, however, upheld the refund of benefits provision in a Blue Shield medical insurance contract similar to the one at issue here. <i>Block</i> v. <i>California Physicians’ Service</i>, 53 Cal. Rptr. 51 (Cal. App. 1966).</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="65ffab1b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10E2A_a395957d-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d" id="note-N10E2A_a395957d-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d">19</a></span>&nbsp;Under workmen’s compensation, subrogation normally prevents double recovery by shifting the loss to the tortfeasor.

As noted by one commentator:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="6600e3f9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b">Statements made by insurance representatives before the [Committee], referring to the low number of medical malpractice claims brought in the state, can only create significant doubt that South Dakota was experiencing a genuine insurance crisis at that time. Startling data on medical malpractice claims in South Dakota, North Dakota, and Minnesota, collected by the Minnesota Department of Commerce from 1982-1987 [the Hatch Study], also tends to call into question the basis for cries of <i>any</i> insurance crisis; if claim frequency and severity did not change significantly in those years, and if in those same six years only one-half of one percent of all medical malpractice plaintiffs were awarded any damages, why then did physicians’ insurance premiums <i>triple</i> in that same time period?</p></div>
<p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="6600e3fa-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b">Eiesland, <i>infra</i>, at 703 (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="6600e3fb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b">The Hatch Study concluded that “despite unchanging claim frequency and declining loss payments and loss expense, on average, physicians paid approximately triple the amount of premiums for malpractice insurance in 1987 than in 1982.” Hatch Study, at 31.</p>
<p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="6600e3fc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b">Evidence presented to the 1975 Committee indicated that only two jury verdicts in the last few years had been obtained against doctors in South Dakota. One verdict was for $1 and the other was for $10,000.</p></div>

Continue to create, edit, or export your case briefs from the CASES page.</p>

<p id="65e78f32-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Even when the plaintiff in a tort suit can prove the elements of her cause of action, this does not necessarily mean that the war is over. Tort law has recognized a number of doctrines that can still serve to defeat (or sometimes lessen) the plaintiff’s attempted recovery. These are considered “affirmative defenses”—defenses that, in effect, say “even though you have proven my negligent conduct was the legal cause of your harm, I still win because <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>.” This chapter will fill in that blank with a variety of potential affirmative defenses. Chapter 3 introduced some affirmative defenses unique to intentional torts. This chapter covers affirmative defenses of a more general application, including defenses to negligence claims. Whereas a plaintiff has the burden of proving the elements of her claim, a defendant has the burden of proving any affirmative defenses. A number of these defenses have been modified by relatively recent developments in the law, some of them late in coming. Often, changes to these affirmative defenses have been driven by state legislatures rather than the common law. Mastering these defenses and understanding the rationale behind them are the twin goals of this chapter.</p>
<p id="65e78f33-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We begin with some <i>blame the plaintiff</i> defenses that have been recognized to defeat the plaintiff’s recovery when the plaintiff has misbehaved in some fashion or has acted in a way that relieves the defendant’s duty of care. Contributory negligence is a concept we have already seen on the periphery when we learned about the duty of reasonable care and the concept of proving breach <span title="466" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-466">p. 466</span>of the duty. For example, you will recall Judge Cardozo in the case of <i>Martin v. Herzog</i>, declared that the plaintiff could not possibly recover because he had driven his buggy at night without the lights required by statute. In that context, the doctrine of negligence <i>per se</i> proved contributory negligence. Contributory negligence in its classic sense is a harsh doctrine; a silver bullet defense so severe that all but a handful of states have now replaced it with <i>comparative fault</i> which often just serves to reduce, rather than eliminate, the plaintiff’s recovery. We will also delve into two additional varieties of <i>assumption of the risk</i>—express assumption of the risk and secondary implied assumption of the risk. Unlike primary assumption of the risk, which we saw was merely another way of finding that the defendant acted reasonably with regard to inherent risks, these two varieties of assumption of risk are true affirmative defenses based on the plaintiff’s decision to confront willingly the danger created by the defendant’s negligence.</p>

At the trial before Bayley, J. at Derby, it appeared that the defendant, for the purpose of making some repairs to his house, which was close by the road side at one end of the town, had put up a pole across this part of the road, a free passage being left by another branch or street in the same direction. That the plaintiff left a public house not far distant from the place in question at 8 o’clock in the evening in August, when they were just beginning to light candles, but while there was light enough left to discern the obstruction at 100 yards distance: and the witness, who proved this, said that if the plaintiff had not been riding very hard he might have observed and avoided it: the plaintiff however, who was riding violently, did not observe it, but rode against it, and fell with his horse and was much hurt in consequence of the accident; and there was no evidence of his being intoxicated at the time. On this evidence Bayley J. directed the jury, that if a person riding with reasonable and ordinary care could have seen and avoided the obstruction; and if they were satisfied that the plaintiff was riding along the street extremely hard, and without ordinary care, they should find a verdict for the defendant, which they accordingly did. [Plaintiff requested a new trial; referred to as a “Rule,” which was denied for the reasons set forth in the following two opinions.]</p>

In cases of persons riding upon what is considered to be the wrong side of the road, that would not authorize another purposely to ride up against them. One person being in fault will not dispense with another’s using ordinary care for himself. Two things must concur to support this action, an obstruction in the road by the fault of the defendant, and no want of ordinary care to avoid it on the part of the plaintiff.</p>

A few decades ago, tort reform was just as likely to embody opposite goals. Courts and legislatures alike began to express discomfort with the harshness of contributory negligence and to wonder whether that <i>all or nothing</i> doctrine truly epitomized the tort principles of compensation, deterrence, and punishment, with the defense’s single-minded focus on denying all rewards to negligent plaintiffs. The tide has now turned with most, but not all, jurisdictions abandoning contributory negligence for one of the three different variations of a <i>comparative fault</i> system.

<p id="65e879d5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After judgment was entered for Defendants, Plaintiff brought an appeal alleging the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury regarding the doctrine of comparative negligence.

<p id="65e879d6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The common law contributory negligence doctrine has traditionally been traced to Lord Ellenborough’s opinion in <i>Butterfield v. Forrester</i>, 11 East 60, 103 Eng. Rep. 926 (1809). There, plaintiff, “riding as fast as his horse would go,” was injured after running into an obstruction defendant had placed in the road. Stating as the rule that “one person being in fault will not dispense with another’s using ordinary care,” plaintiff was denied recovery on the basis that he did not use ordinary care to avoid the obstruction.</p>
<p id="65e879d7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The contributory negligence bar was soon brought to America as part of the common law, <i>see Smith v. Smith</i>, 19 Mass. 621, 624 (1824), and proceeded to spread throughout the states. <i>See</i> H.W. Woods, The Negligence Case: Comparative Fault §1:4 (1978). This strict bar may have been a direct outgrowth of the common law system of issue pleading; issue pleading posed questions to be answered “yes” or “no,” leaving common law courts, the theory goes, no choice but to award all or nothing. <i>See</i> J.W. Wade, W.K. Crawford, Jr., and J.L. Ryder, <i>Comparative Fault in Tennessee Tort Actions: Past, Present and Future</i>, 41 Tenn. L. Rev. 423, 424-25 (1974). A number of other rationalizations have been advanced in the attempt to justify the harshness of the “all-or-nothing” bar. Among these: the plaintiff should be penalized for his misconduct; the plaintiff should be deterred from injuring himself; and the plaintiff’s negligence supersedes the defendant’s so as to render defendant’s negligence no longer proximate. <i>See</i> W. Keeton, <i>Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts</i>, §65, at 452 (5th ed. 1984); J.W. Wade, <i>supra</i>, at 424.</p>
<p id="65e879d8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Tennessee, the rule as initially stated was that “if a party, by his own gross negligence, brings an injury upon himself, or contributes to such injury, he cannot recover;” for, in such cases, the party “must be regarded as the author of his own misfortune.” <i>Whirley v. Whiteman</i>, 38 Tenn. 610, 619 (1858).

Craig</i>, 19 S.W.2d 234, 234-35 (1929<i>)</i>; where defendant’s conduct was “grossly” negligent, <i>see, e.g., Ellithorpe v. Ford Motor Co.</i>, 503 S.W.2d 516, 522 (Tenn. 1973<i>)</i>; where defendant had the “last clear chance” with which, through the exercise of ordinary care, to avoid plaintiff’s injury, <i>see, e.g., Roseberry v. Lippner</i>, 574 S.W.2d 726, 728 (Tenn. 1978); or where plaintiff’s negligence may be classified as “remote.” <i>See, e.g., Arnold v. Hayslett, 6</i>55 S.W.2d 941, 945 (Tenn. 1983).</p>

<p id="65e8a0f4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two basic forms of comparative fault are utilized by 45 of our sister jurisdictions, these variants being commonly referred to as either “pure” or “modified.” In the “pure” form, a plaintiff’s damages are reduced in proportion to the percentage negligence attributed to him; for example, a plaintiff responsible for 90 percent of the negligence that caused his injuries nevertheless may recover 10 percent of his damages. In the “modified” form, plaintiffs recover as in pure jurisdictions, but only if the plaintiff’s negligence either (1) does not exceed (“50 percent” jurisdictions) or (2) is less than (“49 percent” jurisdictions) the defendant’s negligence.</p>
<p id="65e8a0f5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although we conclude that the all-or-nothing rule of contributory negligence must be replaced, we nevertheless decline to abandon totally our fault-based tort system.

<p id="65e8a0f6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We recognize that modified comparative fault systems have been criticized as merely shifting the arbitrary contributory negligence bar to a new ground. <i>See, e.g., Li v.

<div class="epub-heading cc-font-xlarge left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="65e8a0fb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b">NOTES AND PROBLEMS</p></h3></div>
<p id="65e8a0fc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Principled Reform.</i></b> The <i>Balentine</i> decision does a good job of summarizing the transformation of the vast majority of jurisdictions to some form of comparative fault. The court refers to four primary reasons behind the old contributory negligence rule: (1) that courts used to deal exclusively in black and white, “yes or no” jury verdicts; (2) that negligent plaintiffs must be punished; (3) that plaintiffs must be deterred from misconduct; and (4) that the plaintiff’s negligence supersedes a defendant’s prior act of negligence and, as a matter of law, negates proximate causation. Other changes in tort law have shown that both courts and juries can thrive in systems that permit something other than yes and no answers. In Chapter 9, Apportionment, for example, we will explore a related change from joint and several liability to several liability that similarly invites more nuanced jury findings in determining the tortfeasors’ fault. And while it is true that a plaintiff’s negligent conduct that contributes to their harm cannot be ignored (or else principles of punishment and deterrence are rendered impotent), lawmakers have recognized that the problem with contributory negligence is that it completely ignores the fault of the defendant and provides a windfall to that bad actor. Finally, as you should appreciate from the facts in <i>Balentine</i>, it is often simply incorrect to label the plaintiff’s misconduct as “superseding” because the conduct might be quite foreseeable—as was the plaintiff’s careless horse riding in <i>Butterfield</i> and the plaintiff’s failure to take appropriate corrective actions in <i>Meadows.</i> Do you also see how relying upon proximate cause doctrines to account for a plaintiff’s negligence is just another “all or nothing” approach?</p>
<p id="65e8a0fd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Other Mitigation Doctrines Under Contributory Negligence.</i></b> Under contributory negligence, many jurisdictions sometimes felt discomfort with eliminating all recovery by the plaintiff in certain situations despite the plaintiff’s negligence. One of these mentioned in <i>Balentine</i> was the doctrine of <i>last clear chance</i>; this doctrine declared that even if a plaintiff’s own fault placed the plaintiff in a situation of peril, this could be ignored if the defendant had a chance to avoid causing the accident and failed to do so through its own misconduct. The <i>last clear chance</i> doctrine applied when the defendant had seen the plaintiff and failed to avoid inflicting the injury, despite having a good opportunity to do so at a point when the plaintiff had no such chance. In <span title="475" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-475">p. 475</span>addition to this plaintiff friendly doctrine, many jurisdictions also refused to recognize the defense of contributory negligence when the defendant’s misconduct rose to the level of either gross negligence or an intentional tort. These devices are no longer seen as necessary under modern comparative fault systems because of their rejection of the harsh all or nothing consequences. Instead, the jury considers all of these circumstances in apportioning fault among the parties.</p>

<p id="65e8c810-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">One scholar observed that most <i>courts</i> adopting comparative fault have chosen the “pure” system over a “modified” system because only pure comparative fault directly and completely ties the consequences of one’s negligence to the jury’s allocation of responsibility for the harm. By contrast, legislatures have tended to choose a modified form as a compromise between the perceived extremes of contributory negligence and pure comparative fault.

<p id="65e9647b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">In states that have rejected the all or nothing approach of contributory negligence and adopted a form of comparative fault, the issue becomes <i>how exactly is the jury supposed to decide the percentages of fault or responsibility</i>? Is it a function of comparing the reprehensibility of each party’s misconduct; or should the jury be apportioning the causal role that each party’s conduct played in bringing about the plaintiff’s injury? In other words, is the jury comparing how negligent each of the parties was, or is the jury deciding which party’s negligence played a greater causal role in bringing about the accident? This problem has been exacerbated by the law’s development of a strict liability theory of recovery in defective products cases—a so-called “liability without fault.” (We will be exploring strict liability and products liability in Chapters 10 and 11.) Because most states adopting products liability recognize comparative negligence as an affirmative defense in such cases, how can the jury apportion “fault” between the parties or compare the relative fault between the parties and the defective product? The following case illustrates a mainstream approach to the problem of how juries should play the blame game.</p>

<p id="65e98b97-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first is that the formula calls upon the factfinder to assess the relative magnitude of the parties’ respective “fault.” As stated by a leading textbook on these laws: “The process is <i>not</i> allocation of physical causation, which could be scientifically apportioned, but rather of allocating <i>fault</i>, which cannot be scientifically measured.” Schwartz, <i>Comparative Negligence</i> 276 (1974). It has been recognized that fault is an evaluation that does not lend itself to quantification, so that a comparison of fault magnifies the subjective elements already intrinsic to the ordinary judgment of negligence. This is true even in assigning proportions to two or more distinct types of negligence, but critics have found a greater theoretical obstacle when the responsibility of one party is grounded in fault other than negligence, or in no fault at all. The obstacle is greater where strict products liability is explained as a device for spreading losses from economic activity regardless of fault.…Whether the “fault” in products liability inheres in the defective product or in the act of placing it on the market, however, difficulties of comparison with the injured party’s fault undeniably remain.</p>

<p id="65e98b99-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some courts, applying comparative negligence law to products liability under statutes different from ours or under no statute, have tried to escape the difficulty by stating that the allocation of damages is to reflect relative causation, that is to say, an assessment of the proportion in which the plaintiff’s <span title="478" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-478">p. 478</span>injuries were caused by the product defect on the one hand and by plaintiff’s own negligence on the other. <i>See, e.g., Murray v. Fairbanks Morse</i>, 610 F.2d 149 (3d Cir. 1979) (applying Virgin Island comparative negligence statute); <i>Pan-Alaska Fisheries, Inc. v. Marine Const. &amp; Design Co.</i>, 565 F.2d 1129 (9th Cir. 1977) (admiralty law). They have done so in the belief that this is conceptually more logical or pragmatically easier than to compare the defect of a product with the negligence of one whom it has injured. In <i>Murray v. Fairbanks Morse</i>, for instance, Judge Rosenn wrote for the Third Circuit:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65e98b9a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The key conceptual distinction between strict products liability theory and negligence is that the plaintiff need not prove faulty <i>conduct</i> on the part of the defendant in order to recover. The jury is not asked to determine if the defendant deviated from a standard of care in producing his product. There is no proven faulty conduct of the defendant to compare with the faulty conduct of the plaintiff in order to apportion the responsibility for an accident. Although we may term a defective product “faulty,” it is qualitatively different from the plaintiff’s conduct that contributes to his injury. A comparison of the two is therefore inappropriate.</p>
<p id="65e98b9b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We believe that if the loss for a particular injury is to be apportioned between the product defect and the plaintiff’s misconduct, the only conceptual basis for comparison is the causative contribution of each to the particular loss or injury. In apportioning damages we are really asking how much of the injury was caused by the defect in the product versus how much was caused by the plaintiff’s own actions.</p></div>
<p id="65e98b9c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">610 F.2d at 159. With due respect to these courts, however, we are not persuaded that the concept of “comparative causation” is more cogent or meaningful than comparative fault, if by “causation” is meant some relation of cause and effect in the physical world rather than the very attribution of responsibility for which “causation” is to serve as the premise.</p>
<p id="65e98b9d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both the defect and the plaintiff’s fault must in fact be causes of one injury before a question of apportionment of fault arises. Although defendants in this case had completed all acts necessary for liability when they manufactured and mounted a dangerously defective tire that might blow out and overturn the Sandford pickup, they obviously would not be liable if the pickup overturned for some unrelated reason. Similarly, it would not matter that a driver operated his car unlawfully or recklessly if he was injured by an explosion due to an electrical defect that would have occurred with the same harmful consequences if the car had been standing still. In less obvious situations where the physical course of events is in doubt, if either party convinces the factfinder that its misconduct in fact was not a cause of the injury, there is no occasion for allocating partial damages.</p>
<p id="65e98b9e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The concept of apportioning causation must be tested on the assumption that both causes had to join to produce the injury for which damages are to be allocated. Once it is assumed, however, that two or more distinct causes had to <span title="479" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-479">p. 479</span>occur to produce an indivisible injury, we doubt that the purpose of the proportional fault concept is to subject the combined causation to some kind of vector analysis, even in the rare case of simultaneous, physically commensurable forces. In most cases, it would be a vain exercise.</p>

<p id="65e98ba0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A third view considers it futile to attempt to explain what is to be compared, because it is equally illogical to compare strict liability with negligence and to quantify the relative causative effect of either when it would have caused no harm in the absence of the other. Thus Dean Twerski, in the cited article, describes the technical problems of making the comparison as a “red herring”: “The short answer to the dilemma of how one can compare strict liability and negligence is that one must simply close one’s eyes and accomplish the task.” 10 Ind. L. Rev. 796, 806-808. The opinion in <i>Pan-Alaska, supra</i>, similarly questions the significance of theoretical distinctions when it states:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65e9b2b1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In any event, whether we use the term comparative fault, contributory negligence, comparative causation, or even comparative blameworthiness, we are merely beating around the semantical bush seeking to achieve an equitable method of allocating the responsibility for an injury or loss.</p></div>
<p id="65e9b2b2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">565 F.2d at 1139. In part this second view rests on the assumption that rational analysis in tort cases dissolves in the collegial judgment of juries. That is probably an unwarranted generalization; ability and effort to decide in accordance with law can be expected to differ from one jury to the next with such variables as the makeup of the particular jury, with the quality of evidence and advocacy, and not least with the rationality of the legal formulations in which the court explains the jury’s task to it.</p>
<p id="65e9b2b3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In any event, the assumption does not let us escape the need to state coherent rules of liability. Some tort cases are tried to the court without a jury, as <i>Pan-Alaska, supra</i>, illustrates. Trial judges must know on what findings an apportionment of damages depends, whether these are to be made by the judge or by a jury. Our system of appeal as well as trial predicates that jurors will conscientiously attempt to apply the law if it is explained in comprehensible terms. A juror who wants to know how to treat cause and how to treat fault is entitled to an answer, whatever comes of it in a collective decision. Counsel need to know whether to address the relative gravity of the parties’ fault or to seek expert testimony on the relative impact of their respective fault in causing the asserted harm. We cannot dismiss the question as a distinction without a difference.</p>
<p id="65e9b2b4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws attempted to overcome the distinction, or perhaps split the difference, in a <span title="480" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-480">p. 480</span>proposed Uniform Comparative Fault Act, by calling on the factfinder, in determining the percentages of fault, to “consider both the nature of the conduct of each party at fault and the extent of the causal relation between the conduct and the damages claimed.” <i>See</i> Wade, <i>Products Liability and Plaintiff’s Fault—The Uniform Comparative Fault Act</i>, 29 Mercer L Rev 373 (1978). This might add the difficulties of comparing causation to those of comparing fault if causation in fact were meant, especially since the act also calls for special findings. But the comments indicate that “the extent of the causal relation” does not mean causation in fact but what has traditionally been labeled “proximate cause.” In <i>Murray v. Fairbanks Morse, supra</i>, also, “proximate” causation rather than factual causation turns out to be what the court means by “comparative causation.”</p>
<p id="65e9b2b5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Proportionate fault under ORS 18.470</i>. ORS 18.470, <i>supra</i>, by its terms applies whenever “the fault attributable to the person seeking recovery was not greater than the combined fault of the person or persons against whom recovery is sought.” If there was such fault, “any damages allowed shall be diminished in the proportion to the percentage of fault attributable to the person recovering.” There is no reference to causation, or to any question how much the fault of each contributed to the injury. Indeed, the reference to negligence “contributing to the injury” in former ORS 18.470 was removed in the 1975 amendment. We do not mean that the allegedly faulty conduct or condition need not have affected the event for which recovery is sought; as we have said, it must have been a cause in fact. But the statute does not call for apportioning damages by quantifying the contribution of several causes that had to coincide to produce the injury.</p>
<p id="65e9b2b6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rather, ORS 18.470 falls within the first of the different approaches that we have reviewed. It calls upon the factfinder to assess and quantify fault. If the plaintiff’s conduct is not faultless, the assessment has two purposes: To determine whether her fault is “not greater than” that of defendants, and if it is not, then to reduce the plaintiff’s recovery of damages “in the proportion to the percentage of fault attributable to” the plaintiff.</p>
<p id="65e9b2b7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[I]f the plaintiff’s behavior which was one cause of the injury is alleged to have been negligent or otherwise “fault,” it is to be measured against behavior that would have been faultless under the circumstances. The factfinder is to determine the degree to which the plaintiff’s behavior fell short of that norm and express this deficit as a numerical percentage, which then is applied to diminish the recoverable damages. There necessarily must be some comparable assessment of the fault attributable to defendants as a departure from the norm invoked against them (which, in products liability, will involve the magnitude of the defect rather than negligence or moral “blameworthiness”) in order to determine which is greater. In this comparison, the benchmark for assessing a defendant’s fault for marketing a product which is dangerously defective in design, manufacture, or warning is what the product should have been without the defect. The benchmark for the injured claimant’s fault is conduct which <span title="481" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-481">p. 481</span>would not be unlawful or careless in any relevant respect.

This involves a comparison of the culpability of the parties, meaning by culpability not moral blame but the degree of departure from the standard of a reasonable man. [C]omparison is invited between degrees of fault which may range from trivial inadvertence to the grossest recklessness. In judging the conduct of an actor it should be considered complete carefulness is at one end, a deliberate intention to bring about the result is at the other. Negligence ranges from the least blameworthy type, namely, inadvertence and negligent errors of judgment up to a state where knowledge or more complete knowledge supervenes and the negligence of obstinacy, self-righteousness or reckless is reached. The factfinder must be told then under our statute, it should give consideration to the relative blameworthiness of the causative fault of the claimant and of the defendant.”</p></div>

In bench trials, the judge needs to know what it is she is apportioning, and appellate courts, in reviewing the sufficiency of evidence, need to know what it is they are looking for in the evidence. And juries, attempting their best to listen to the court’s instructions and the arguments of counsel, need to have some basis upon which to act. In short, the issue matters in the real world where juries are frequently asked to apportion between the claimant and the defendant. The <i>Sandford</i> court embraces the idea of comparing the blameworthiness of the parties (or product), in part, because comparing the causal role makes no sense when actual “but for” cause demands that the parties’ conduct (or product) played an essential role in order to create liability in the first instance.</p>

<p id="65ea00f1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mark Beaudoin, the plaintiff, was an employee of Wood Wireline. Texaco, Inc., the defendant, hired Wireline to conduct a pressure gradient check on Texaco’s well, CM Loomer #13 near Keene, North Dakota.</p>
<p id="65ea2802-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Beaudoin and a co-worker arrived on the unlighted site before dawn on February 21, 1983, to prepare their equipment for the job. Beaudoin was uncoiling wire from a large spool mounted on the wireline rig when he was struck in the left eye by the end of the wire. He is now legally blind in that eye.</p>
<p id="65ea2803-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Texaco’s employee John Spain arrived after the incident occurred to supervise the work being done on the site.</p>
<p id="65ea2804-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On March 29, 1985, Beaudoin brought an action for damages against Texaco. Beaudoin alleged that the injury was the result of Texaco’s negligence in requiring the work to commence at an hour that would require the equipment to be set up in darkness, in failing to provide proper lighting, and in failing to properly supervise the work. Texaco alleged that the injury was the result of Beaudoin’s negligence in handling the wire carelessly. Both parties denied the negligence alleged against them. Testimony was presented at trial that could have led to the conclusion that Wood Wireline was negligent in failing to provide proper equipment and training for its employees. Wood Wireline is immune from liability under the provisions of North Dakota’s worker’s compensation law, NDCC §65-04-28, and is not a defendant in the action.</p>

<p id="65ea2806-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That determination depends on the proper interpretation and application of North Dakota’s comparative negligence statute.</p>

<p id="65ea2809-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The narrow question before this court is whether in cases involving a negligent plaintiff and more than one other negligent actor this statute allows recovery only against those defendants more negligent than the plaintiff or against all negligent defendants so long as the plaintiff’s negligence is less than the combined negligence of the other negligent actors. The North Dakota Supreme Court has not ruled on this issue, and the other jurisdictions are divided.</p>
<p id="65ea280a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This court must first determine how a federal district court sitting with diversity jurisdiction should properly approach resolving a legal issue not yet settled by the highest court of the law-determining state.</p>
<p id="65ea280b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This court will not presume to divine the thinking or inclinations of the justices of the North Dakota Supreme Court, but will attempt to examine and weigh the persuasive authority as that court would if this issue were before it. Those sources include the case law of sister states, the case law of the other states, the majority rule and modern trend if there are such, and principles of justice and equity. It is the opinion of this court that there is no conflict between the goal of seeking the best legal conclusion and the goal of seeking the conclusion that the North Dakota Supreme Court would reach.</p>
<p id="65ea280c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the states have abandoned the harsh and outdated rule of contributory negligence they have replaced it with one of two general types of comparative negligence. A number of jurisdictions have adopted “pure” comparative negligence. Under this rule, every party is liable for its own share of the negligence. If, for example, a plaintiff bears 60% of the responsibility for the injuries he has suffered, he will bear 60% of the cost, while the negligent defendant whose responsibility is 40% will be liable for 40% of the cost. Other jurisdictions, including North Dakota, have opted for a system of “modified” comparative negligence. These systems vary in detail, but all prohibit a plaintiff who is assigned more than 50% of the causal negligence from recovering any damages. Following this approach the 40% negligent defendant in the example above would be completely free from any liability. Whatever the merits of the policy reasons for the adoption of modified comparative negligence, such systems lead to a number of unavoidable complications, one of which confronts this court today.</p>
<p id="65ea280d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Modified comparative negligence jurisdictions follow one of two rules for determining the damage award in cases with multiple tortfeasors at least one of which is less negligent than the plaintiff: the “Wisconsin rule” and the “unit rule.” Under the Wisconsin <span title="485" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-485">p. 485</span>rule the plaintiff’s share of the negligence is compared in turn with the negligence apportioned to each individual defendant. Any defendant whose percentage of the negligence is lower than, or, in North Dakota, equal to, the plaintiff’s, is dismissed from the case. Under the unit rule the plaintiff’s share of the negligence is compared to the sum of the shares of negligence apportioned to the other negligent actors. If the plaintiff’s share is less than that sum, then the plaintiff can recover from each of the defendants. This court must determine which of these rules should, from the perspective of the North Dakota Supreme Court, be applied in this case.</p>
<p id="65ea4f1e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Minnesota follows, and Wisconsin initiated, the Wisconsin rule. <i>Marier v. Memorial Rescue Service, Inc</i>., 296 Minn. 242, 207 N.W.2d 706, 707, 708 (1973), <i>Walker v. Kroger Grocery &amp; Baking Co</i>., 214 Wis. 519, 252 N.W. 721, 727, 728 (1934). Absent any countervailing considerations, that rule should be applied in this case. There are, however, a number of countervailing considerations.</p>
<p id="65ea4f1f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Wisconsin rule is the minority rule. This court has discovered fourteen states that follow the unit rule, but only six that follow the Wisconsin rule.</p>
<p id="65ea4f20-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The unit rule is the modern trend. Of the six Wisconsin rule states, four adopted the rule ten or more years ago. Seven states have had to choose between the alternative rules in the last five years, and all seven have chosen the unit rule.</p>
<p id="65ea4f21-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is evident that the weight of authority is heavily in favor of the unit rule. Furthermore, even the states that have adopted the Wisconsin rule do not appear to strongly support it. None of the six opinions in which state high courts chose the Wisconsin rule was based on arguments supporting the rule on its merits. As the Utah Supreme Court observed, “almost without variation, those states that have adopted the Wisconsin rule have done so on the rather wooden analysis that the Legislature must have intended to adopt the court decisions construing the Wisconsin statute as a part of that state’s law.” 679 P.2d at 909. This approach, based only on a canon of statutory construction, has been thoroughly repudiated. <i>See, e.g</i>., 642 P.2d at 632, 679 P.2d at 905, 624 P.2d at 388-394 (Bistline, J., dissenting). Suffice to say that, as discussed above, the North Dakota Supreme Court gives serious consideration to the judicial gloss of the source state of a statute, but does not abdicate its judicial and intellectual responsibilities in doing so. Following the supreme court’s approach, the fact that North Dakota derived §9-10-07 from Wisconsin by way of Minnesota creates a presumption in favor of Wisconsin case law, but it does not settle the question without further inquiry.</p>
<p id="65ea4f22-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The other argument generally relied on by courts adopting the Wisconsin rule is that their comparative negligence statute is phrased in terms of a single defendant, as is North Dakota’s: “if such negligence was not as great as the negligence of the person against whom recovery is sought.…” NDCC §9-10-07. The Code contains a provision aimed at preventing this kind of misplaced reliance. “Words used in the singular number include the plural and words used in the plural number include the singular, except when a contrary intention plainly appears.” NDCC §1-01-35. The intention appearing from the text of §9-10-07 is, of course, not plain. It is not clear whether the legislature intended to excuse all defendants whose negligence is less than the plaintiff’s or to limit recovery only to those plaintiffs who bear less than half the fault for their own injuries. In the absence of a plain meaning of §9-10-07’s text, §1-01-35 becomes operative, and <span title="486" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-486">p. 486</span>the term “person” in §9-10-07 must be taken to include both the singular and the plural. This statutorily mandated rule of construction requires the adoption of the unit rule, as it aggregates the negligence of the other parties at fault for comparison with the negligence of the plaintiff.</p>
<p id="65ea4f23-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Perhaps the most telling strike against the Wisconsin rule is that it is no longer supported by the Wisconsin Supreme Court.</p>

<p id="65ea4f24-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case is one of many cases which have come before this court involving multiple party tortfeasors.…The majority of the court has become convinced that comparing the negligence of the individual plaintiff to that of each individual tortfeasor—rather than comparing the negligence of the individual plaintiff to that of the combined negligence of the several tortfeasors who have collectively contributed to plaintiff’s injuries—leads to harsh and unfair results.…</p></div>
<p id="65ea4f25-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>May v. Skelley Oil Co</i>., 83 Wis. 2d 30, 264 N.W.2d 574, 578 (1978). It appears that at present the Wisconsin Supreme Court adheres to the rule because it considers itself bound by its prior holdings and the state legislature’s failure to counteract them. <i>Reiter v. Dyken</i>, 95 Wis. 2d 461, 290 N.W.2d 510, 515-517 (1980). The North Dakota Supreme Court is not caught in such a trap, and so those considerations do not apply in this state.</p>
<p id="65ea4f26-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The factors leading to the adoption of the unit rule are numerous and compelling. This court has considered the following factors in weighing its decision: the unit rule is the majority rule and the modern trend; those courts that have most thoroughly reviewed the arguments of policy and law have chosen the unit rule, while those courts opting for the Wisconsin rule have generally done so because of undue deference to a canon of statutory construction or misplaced reliance on statutory phraseology; application of the unit rule in North Dakota is mandated by §1-01-35. Further arguments against the Wisconsin rule and in favor of the unit rule have been made. <i>See, e.g</i>., 483 A.2d at 483-489, 679 P.2d at 904-909.</p>
<p id="65ea4f27-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Following this approach, this court concludes that the North Dakota Supreme Court would profit from the misfortune of Wisconsin, and avoid placing itself in the trap in which that court finds itself. This court is convinced that the correct decision is to apply the unit rule in this case, and that that is the decision the North Dakota Supreme Court would reach.</p>
<p id="65ea4f28-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Application of the unit rule in this case raises the issue of whether “the person against whom recovery is sought” includes statutorily immune employers who were not made parties to a suit. Other states have reviewed this issue and determined that they are to be included. In this case, therefore, Beaudoin’s negligence, 30%, will be compared against the negligence of Texaco and Wireline, 70%. Since Beaudoin’s negligence is less, he can recover.</p>
<p id="65ea4f29-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In North Dakota a joint tortfeasor is liable for the share of negligence attributed to a statutorily immune employer. <i>Layman v. Braunschweigische Maschinenbauanstalt, Inc</i>., 343 N.W.2d 334, 344-350 (N.D. 1983). In this case, then, <span title="487" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-487">p. 487</span>Texaco, which was only 10% contributorily negligent, will be forced to pay 70% of the damages. This is clearly an inequitable result, but given the current state of the law it is unavoidable.</p>
<p id="65ea753a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the Wisconsin rule were applied to the facts of this case, Beaudoin, who was only 30% contributorily negligent, would be denied any recovery. This would be an inequitable result. Further, it would be an inequitable result imposed by the operation of the comparative negligence provision of §9-10-07. The result actually reached is also inequitable, but the inequity is imposed by the operation of the joint and several liability provision of §9-10-07 and the immunity provision of §65-04-28. As was noted at the opening of this order, it is a collision of legal principles that renders an equitable result in this case impossible. This court has declined to adopt an outmoded rule that works inequity, but another outmoded and inequitable rule, joint and several liability, still remains to prevent a just outcome. Some states have abolished this rule as a part of their statutory system of comparative negligence, <i>see, e.g., Teepak, Inc. v. Learned</i>, 237 Kan. 320, 699 P.2d 35, 38 (1985), but the North Dakota Legislature has not yet done so. If it were to adopt a several liability rule, then the combination of that rule and the unit rule would produce more nearly equitable results than can be achieved if either the Wisconsin rule or the joint and several liability rule is present.</p>

<p id="65ea7542-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The dilemma the court faced in <i>Texaco</i> would not matter in either a contributory negligence or a pure comparative fault jurisdiction because no comparison between (or among) the claimant and the defendant(s) is needed to implement the doctrine. Either the plaintiff recovers nothing (in contributory negligence) or the plaintiff recovers something (in pure comparative fault). But in modified comparative fault, the court must consider whether <i>any</i> recovery is permitted in light of the plaintiff’s apportionment. Unfortunately, many of the modified comparative fault statutes are written in a manner similar to the North <span title="488" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-488">p. 488</span>Dakota statute in <i>Texaco</i>. That is, the statutes are often worded as if the only parties being apportioned fault are a single plaintiff and a single defendant. When that is not the case, the court must ascertain the appropriate method by which to compare fault levels.</p>
<p id="65ea7543-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Other Rationales for Rejection of the Wisconsin Rule.</i></b> The federal district court in <i>Texaco</i> alludes to other public policy reasons for rejecting the Wisconsin rule. One is based upon the conceptual math problems. For example, consider if a jury apportioned fault 30 percent to the plaintiff, 60 percent to Defendant 1, and 10 percent to Defendant 2. Under the Wisconsin rule, the court would first compare the plaintiff’s fault of 30 percent with Defendant 1’s fault of 60 percent (and permit recovery). Then the court would compare plaintiff’s 30 percent fault with Defendant 2’s 10 percent (and reject any recovery against that defendant). But all of this comparison would involve a total of 130 percent fault rather than limiting the universe of fault to 100 percent. The other problem with the Wisconsin rule is more pragmatic—the more tortfeasors that cause the plaintiff’s harm (and are included in the apportionment question) the more likely the plaintiff will be unable to recover. For example, if there are three defendants who contribute to the plaintiff’s injury and the jury assesses fault against all three and plaintiff equally, they will each be 25 percent at fault—plaintiff will be unable to recover in a 49 percent modified comparative fault state (since plaintiff’s fault is not less than any defendant). But if there was only one defendant apportioned the 75 percent fault, plaintiff could easily recover something in a modified comparative fault state. Courts often cite these additional arguments for rejecting the Wisconsin rule.</p>

That doctrine is not an affirmative defense but a particular way of concluding that the defendant who provided the activity was not negligent. In terms of true affirmative defenses, tort law has traditionally recognized two varieties of assumption of the risk: (a) <i>express</i> assumption of the risk, where the plaintiff has promised not to hold the defendant liable for its own negligence prior to the injury; and (b) <i>secondary implied</i> assumption of the risk, where the plaintiff has knowingly and voluntarily decided to encounter a risk previously created by the defendant’s negligence.</p>

<p id="65eac377-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case concerns the validity of a release from liability for future negligence imposed as a condition for admission to a charitable research hospital. For the reasons we hereinafter specify, we have concluded that an agreement between a hospital and an entering patient affects the public interest and that, in consequence, the exculpatory provision included within it must be invalid under Civil Code section 1668.</p>
<p id="65eac378-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hugo Tunkl brought this action to recover damages for personal injuries alleged to have resulted from the negligence of two physicians in the employ of the University of California Los Angeles Medical Center, a hospital operated and maintained by the Regents of the University of California as a nonprofit <span title="490" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-490">p. 490</span>charitable institution. Mr. Tunkl died after suit was brought, and his surviving wife, as executrix, was substituted as plaintiff.</p>
<p id="65eac379-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center admitted Tunkl as a patient on June 11, 1956. The Regents maintain the hospital for the primary purpose of aiding and developing a program of research and education in the field of medicine; patients are selected and admitted if the study and treatment of their condition would tend to achieve these purposes. Upon his entry to the hospital, Tunkl signed a document setting forth certain “Conditions of Admission.” The crucial condition number six reads as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65eac37a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Release: The hospital is a nonprofit, charitable institution. In consideration of the hospital and allied services to be rendered and the rates charged therefor, the patient or his legal representative agrees to and hereby releases The Regents of the University of California, and the hospital from any and all liability for the negligent or wrongful acts or omissions of its employees, if the hospital has used due care in selecting its employees.</p></div>
<p id="65eac37b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff stipulated that the hospital had selected its employees with due care. The trial court ordered that the issue of the validity of the exculpatory clause be first submitted to the jury and that, if the jury found that the provision did not bind plaintiff, a second jury try the issue of alleged malpractice. When, on the preliminary issue, the jury returned a verdict sustaining the validity of the executed release, the court entered judgment in favor of the Regents.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10738_a395957c-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10738_a395957c-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d">3</a></span> Plaintiff appeals from the judgment.</p>
<p id="65eac37d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In one respect, as we have said, the decisions [regarding the enforceability of exculpatory provisions] are uniform. The cases have consistently held that the exculpatory provision may stand only if it does not involve “the public interest.”
<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10742_a395957c-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10742_a395957c-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d">6</a></span> In <i>Stephens</i> v. <i>Southern Pac. Co</i>. (1895) 109 Cal. 86 [41 P. 783, 50 Am. St. Rep. 17, 29 L.R.A. 751], a railroad company had leased land, which adjoined its depot, to a lessee who had constructed a warehouse upon it. The lessee covenanted that the railroad company would not be responsible for damage from fire “caused from any…means.” This exemption, under the court ruling, applied to the lessee’s damage resulting from the railroad company’s carelessly burning dry grass and rubbish. Declaring the contract not “violative of sound public policy,” the court pointed out “As far as this transaction was concerned, the parties when contracting stood upon common ground, and dealt with each other as <span title="491" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-491">p. 491</span>A and B might deal with each other with reference to any private business undertaking.” The court concluded “that the <i>interests of the public</i> in the contract are more sentimental than real” and that the exculpatory provision was therefore enforceable.</p>
<p id="65eac37f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In applying this approach and in manifesting their reaction as to the effect of the exemptive clause upon the public interest, some later courts enforced, and others invalidated such provisions.…Thus in <i>Nichols</i> v. <i>Hitchcock Motor Co</i>. (1937) 70 P.2d 654, the court enforced an exculpatory clause on the ground that “the public neither had nor could have any interest whatsoever in the subject-matter of the contract, considered either as a whole or as to the incidental covenant in question. The agreement between the parties concerned ‘their private affairs’ only.”</p>
<p id="65eac380-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Barkett</i> v. <i>Brucato</i> (1953) 264 P.2d 978, which involved a waiver clause in a private lease, Justice Peters summarizes the previous decisions in this language: “These cases hold that the matter is simply one of interpreting a contract; that both parties are free to contract; that the relationship of landlord and tenant <i>does not affect the public interest</i>; that such a provision <i>affects only the private affairs of the parties</i>.…” (Italics added.)</p>
<p id="65eac381-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, courts struck down exculpatory clauses as contrary to public policy in the case of a contract to transmit a telegraph message (<i>Union Constr. Co.</i> v. <i>Western Union Tel. Co</i>. (1912) 125 P. 242) and in the instance of a contract of bailment ( <i>England</i> v. <i>Lyon Fireproof Storage Co</i>. (1928) 271 P. 532). In <i>Hiroshima</i> v. <i>Bank of Italy</i> (1926) 248 P. 947, the court invalidated an exemption provision in the form used by a payee in directing a bank to stop payment on a check. The court relied in part upon the fact that “the banking public, as well as the particular individual who may be concerned in the giving of any stop-notice, is interested in seeing that the bank is held accountable for the ordinary and regular performance of its duties and, also, in seeing that direction in relation to the disposition of funds deposited in [the] bank are not heedlessly, negligently, and carelessly disobeyed and money paid out, contrary to directions given.”</p>
<p id="65eac382-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In placing particular contracts within or without the category of those affected with a public interest, the courts have revealed a rough outline of that type of transaction in which exculpatory provisions will be held invalid. Thus the attempted but invalid exemption involves a transaction which exhibits some or all of the following characteristics. It concerns a business of a type generally thought suitable for public regulation. The party seeking exculpation is engaged in performing a service of great importance to the public, which is often a matter of practical necessity for some members of the public. The party holds himself out as willing to perform this service for any member of the public who seeks it, or at least for any member coming within certain established standards. As a result of the essential nature of the service, in the economic setting of the transaction, the party invoking exculpation possesses a decisive advantage of bargaining strength against any member of the public who seeks his services. In exercising a superior bargaining power the party confronts the public with a standardized adhesion contract of exculpation, and makes no <span title="492" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-492">p. 492</span>provision whereby a purchaser may pay additional reasonable fees and obtain protection against negligence. Finally, as a result of the transaction, the person or property of the purchaser is placed under the control of the seller, subject to the risk of carelessness by the seller or his agents.</p>
<p id="65eaea93-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While obviously no public policy opposes private, voluntary transactions in which one party, for a consideration, agrees to shoulder a risk which the law would otherwise have placed upon the other party, the above circumstances pose a different situation. In this situation the releasing party does not really acquiesce voluntarily in the contractual shifting of the risk, nor can we be reasonably certain that he receives an adequate consideration for the transfer. Since the service is one which each member of the public, presently or potentially, may find essential to him, he faces, despite his economic inability to do so, the prospect of a compulsory assumption of the risk of another’s negligence. The public policy of this state has been, in substance, to posit the risk of negligence upon the actor; in instances in which this policy has been abandoned, it has generally been to allow or require that the risk shift to another party better or equally able to bear it, not to shift the risk to the weak bargainer.</p>
<p id="65eaea94-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the light of the decisions, we think that the hospital-patient contract clearly falls within the category of agreements affecting the public interest. To meet that test, the agreement need only fulfill some of the characteristics above outlined; here, the relationship fulfills all of them. Thus the contract of exculpation involves an institution suitable for, and a subject of, public regulation. That the services of the hospital to those members of the public who are in special need of the particular skill of its staff and facilities constitute a practical and crucial necessity is hardly open to question.</p>
<p id="65eaea95-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The hospital, likewise, holds itself out as willing to perform its services for those members of the public who qualify for its research and training facilities. While it is true that the hospital is selective as to the patients it will accept, such selectivity does not negate its public aspect or the public interest in it. The hospital is selective only in the sense that it accepts from the public at large certain types of cases which qualify for the research and training in which it specializes. But the hospital does hold itself out to the public as an institution which performs such services for those members of the public who can qualify for them.</p>
<p id="65eaea96-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In insisting that the patient accept the provision of waiver in the contract, the hospital certainly exercises a decisive advantage in bargaining. The would-be patient is in no position to reject the proffered agreement, to bargain with the hospital, or in lieu of agreement to find another hospital. The admission room of a hospital contains no bargaining table where, as in a private business transaction, the parties can debate the terms of their contract. As a result, we cannot but conclude that the instant agreement manifested the characteristics of the so-called adhesion contract. Finally, when the patient signed the contract, he completely placed himself in the control of the hospital; he subjected himself to the risk of its carelessness.</p>
<p id="65eaea97-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In brief, the patient here sought the services which the hospital offered to a selective portion of the public; the patient, as the price of admission and as a <span title="493" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-493">p. 493</span>result of his inferior bargaining position, accepted a clause in a contract of adhesion waiving the hospital’s negligence; the patient thereby subjected himself to control of the hospital and the possible infliction of the negligence which he had thus been compelled to waive. The hospital, under such circumstances, occupied a status different than a mere private party; its contract with the patient affected the public interest. We see no cogent current reason for according to the patron of the inn a greater protection than the patient of the hospital; we cannot hold the innkeeper’s performance affords a greater public service than that of the hospital.</p>

<p id="65eaea9a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">With regard to the willingness to enforce an express assumption of the risk, one court commented: “More than one hundred years ago, it was noted that ‘the right of parties to contract as they please is restricted only by a few well defined and well settled rules, and it must be a very plain case to justify a court in holding a contract to be against public policy.’”</p>

</div>
<p id="65eaea9c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We must note, finally, that the integrated and specialized society of today, structured upon mutual dependency, cannot rigidly narrow the concept of the public interest. From the observance of simple standards of due care in the driving of a car to the performance of the high standards of hospital practice, the individual citizen must be completely dependent upon the responsibility of others. The fabric of this pattern is so closely woven that the snarling of a single thread affects the whole. We cannot lightly accept a sought immunity from careless failure to provide the hospital service upon which many must depend. Even if the hospital’s doors are open only to those in a specialized category, the hospital cannot claim isolated immunity in the interdependent community of our time. It, too, is part of the social fabric, and prearranged exculpation from its negligence must partly rend the pattern and necessarily affect the public interest.</p>

<p id="65eaeaa0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Exculpatory Clauses at Intersection of Different Aims.</i></b> One might wonder, from a torts perspective, why a court would ever enforce an exculpatory clause. It undermines the tort purpose of compensating deserving victims as well as the goal of deterring avoidable injuries. On the other hand, exculpatory clauses are governed to an extent by contract law, which generally permits parties the autonomy to structure their personal affairs as they see fit. Courts have essentially compromised—they will enforce such clauses as an express assumption of the risk so long as the clauses do not violate public policy. Despite the non-exhaustive yet lengthy list of factors utilized in <i>Tunkl</i>, courts seem to enforce these clauses to the extent they merely express the voluntary decision on a private matter to assign (or diminish) duties between those <span title="494" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-494">p. 494</span>parties. Thus, some of the factors relate to whether the activity or transaction is truly just a private matter, and others relate to whether the plaintiff actually and voluntarily agreed to the clause.</p>

<p id="65eaeaa6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Responding to changes in economic and social necessities, courts then went beyond this rule of construction [applying strict scrutiny to an express assumption of the risk] and found that in certain situations and relations express agreements by which one party assumes the risk of another’s conduct could not, in good conscience, be accepted. Where a disparity of bargaining power has grown out of economic necessity for certain goods or services or from a monopolistic position of a seller, courts have found exculpatory agreements inimical to the public interest. Where an agreement does not represent a free choice on the part of the plaintiff, where he is forced to accept the clause by the necessities of the situation, courts have refused to enforce such agreements as contrary to public policy. This rule has been applied broadly in the employer-employee relationship; in situations where one party is charged with a duty of public service; to agreements which attempt to exculpate one from liability for the violation of statute or regulation designed to protect human life; and elsewhere, e.g., Uniform Commercial Code §2-719(3), provides that the limitation of consequential damages for injury to the person in the case of consumer goods is prima facie unconscionable.</p></div>

The manufacturer originally designed, manufactured, and shipped the machine with the clevis pin in place. The manufacturer also provided a user manual warning that keeping the equipment correctly assembled was “critically important to user safety.” At trial, maintenance employees of Vic Tanny acknowledged that the work-out machine could be dangerous if used without the clevis pin. It was also acknowledged that Vic Tanny did not require periodic inspections by any specifically designated employee to make certain that the clevis pin was in place. [Plaintiff’s product liability claim against the manufacturer was dismissed because the evidence showed the defect occurred after it had already been shipped to Defendant intact.]</p>

Alack explained what the clause meant to him during direct examination:</p>

The trial judge decided to submit the issue to the jury. The jury was instructed that it could find in favor of Vic Tanny only if it believed that, when Alack signed the membership agreement, he had agreed to release Vic Tanny from the type of claim involved in this case.

Waid</i>, 392 S.W.2d 270, 272 (Mo. 1965). However, contracts exonerating a party from acts of future negligence are to be “strictly construed against the party claiming the benefit of the contract, and clear and explicit language in the contract is required to absolve a person from such liability.” <i>Hornbeck v. All American Indoor Sports, Inc</i>., 898 S.W.2d 717, 721 (Mo. <span title="498" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-498">p. 498</span>App. 1995).

<p id="65eb5ff9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most states have enforced exculpatory clauses when they include specific references to the negligence or fault of the drafter. In <i>Dresser Industries, Inc. v. Page Petroleum</i>, Inc., 853 S.W.2d 505, 508-509 (Tex. 1993), the Texas Supreme Court applied an “express negligence doctrine” that requires a release to specifically express the intent of a party to be relieved from his or her own negligence. The court explained that indemnity agreements, releases, exculpatory agreements, or waivers are extraordinary methods of shifting the risk of negligent conduct. Therefore, individuals wishing to protect themselves from their own negligence “must express that intent in specific terms within the four corners of the contract.”</p>

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65eb5ffb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the cases make clear, the law’s reluctance to enforce exculpatory provisions of this nature has resulted in the development of an exacting standard by which courts measure their validity. So, it has been repeatedly emphasized that unless the intention of the parties is expressed in unmistakable language, an exculpatory clause will not be deemed to insulate a party from liability for his own negligent acts [citations omitted]. Put another way, it must appear plainly and precisely that the “limitation of liability extends to negligence or other fault of the party attempting to shed his ordinary responsibility” [citations omitted].</p>
<p id="65eb5ffc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not only does this stringent standard require that the drafter of such an agreement make its terms unambiguous, but it mandates that the terms be understandable as well. Thus, a provision that would exempt its drafter from any liability occasioned by his fault should not compel resort to a magnifying glass and lexicon. [Citations omitted.]</p></div>
<p id="65eb5ffd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court then held that a release providing that “I…waive any and all claims,” language remarkably similar to that used in the present case, was insufficient to bar a personal injury action for negligence because the release “nowhere expresses any intention to exempt the defendant from liability for injury or property damages which may result from his failure to use due care.” 400 N.E.2d at 311. In requiring the use of the word “negligence” or “words conveying a similar import” the court noted that while one might accept the risks inherently associated with any particular activity, “it does not follow that he was aware of, much less intended to accept, any <i>enhanced</i> exposure to injury occasioned by the carelessness of the very persons on which he depended for his safety.” 400 N.E.2d at 310-11 (emphasis in original). <i>See also Schlobohm v. Spa Petite, Inc</i>., 326 N.W.2d 920, 923 (Minn. 1982) (barring claim when “negligence” stated in release); <i>Doyle v.

County of Niagara</i>, 117 Misc. 2d 470, 458 N.Y.S.2d 162, 164 (Sup. 1983) (explaining that a negligence claim was not barred unless words referring to the “neglect” or “fault” of the defendant were used in the release); <i>Haugen v. Ford Motor Co.</i>, 219 N.W.2d 462, 470 (N.D. 1974) (holding that there is no “plain and precise” limitation of liability without a reference to “negligence”); <i>Blum v. Kauffman</i>, 297 A.2d 48, 49 (Del. 1972) (explaining that the word “negligence” was not in release and, therefore, did not “clearly and unequivocally” spell out the intent to grant such protection from liability for negligence); <i>Ciofalo v. Vic Tanney Gyms, Inc.</i>, 10 N.Y.2d 294, 177 N.E.2d 925, 926, 220 N.Y.S.2d 962 (N.Y. 1961) (barring claim when “negligence” stated in release).</p>
<p id="65eb5ffe-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other states have said that the word “negligence” is not necessarily required in an agreement in order to release a party from his or her own negligence. In <i>Audley v. Melton</i>, 640 A.2d 777 (N.H. 1994), a model was bitten by a lion during a photography shoot. The model had signed a release stating she realized working with wild animals was potentially dangerous and that she released “the photographer, his/her agents or assigns from any and all liability whatsoever.” The trial court granted the photographer summary judgment on the model’s negligence claim. However, the New Hampshire Supreme Court reversed because the clause failed to bring particular attention “to the notion of releasing the defendant from liability for his own negligence.” While the magic word “negligence” is not required, the language must “put plaintiff on clear notice of such intent.”</p>
<p id="65eb870f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Boehm v. Cody Country Chamber of Commerce</i>, 748 P.2d 704 (Wyo. 1987), a member of a gun club was injured during a mock gunfight. Because he had signed a release, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant gun club, and the Wyoming Supreme Court affirmed. The release stated that the member shall “hold harmless and release [defendant], its agents and employees…from any and all claims and damages which [plaintiff] may incur from participating in any and all activities sanctioned by [defendant].” The court held that such language was a “clear and unambiguous” release of defendant from its own negligence liability even without the use of the word “negligence” in the release.</p>
<p id="65eb8710-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Historically, Missouri appellate courts have required that a release from one’s own future negligence be <i>explicitly</i> stated. In <i>Poslosky v. Firestone Tire and Rubber Co.</i>, 349 S.W.2d 847 (Mo. 1961), this Court held that a tenant was not released from liability for negligently starting a fire when the lease did not contain clear language referring to exemption from negligence. Instead, the lease stated only that “Lessor agrees that it will…keep the improvements on the said premises insured against fire…and all moneys collected from such insurance shall be used toward the full compliance of the obligation of Lessor [to repair or restore the damaged premises].” In holding this language inadequate, the Court noted the traditional rule of construction particular to <span title="500" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-500">p. 500</span>exculpatory clauses by stating that “a contract provision exempting one from liability for his negligence will never be implied but must be explicitly stated.”</p>
<p id="65eb8711-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are persuaded that the best policy is to follow our previous decisions and those of other states that require clear, unambiguous, unmistakable, and conspicuous language in order to release a party from his or her own future negligence. The exculpatory language must effectively notify a party that he or she is releasing the other party from claims arising from the other party’s own negligence. Our traditional notions of justice are so fault-based that most people might not expect such a relationship to be altered, regardless of the length of an exculpatory clause, unless done so explicitly. General language will not suffice.</p>
<p id="65eb8712-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“A determination as to whether a [contract] is ambiguous is a question of law to be decided by the court.” Royal Banks of Missouri v. Fridkin, 819 S.W.2d 359, 361 (Mo. banc 1991). “An ambiguity arises when there is duplicity, indistinctness, or uncertainty in the meaning of the words used in the contract.” <i>Rodriguez v. General Accident Insurance Company of America</i>, 808 S.W.2d 379, 382 (Mo. banc 1991). In this case, the exculpatory clause purports to shield Vic Tanny from liability for “<i>any</i> damages,” “<i>any</i>…injuries” and “<i>any</i> and <i>all</i> claims, demands, damages, rights of action, present or future…resulting from or arising out of the Member’s…use…of said gymnasium or the facilities and equipment thereof.” (Emphasis added.) Vic Tanny argues that this language is clear and unambiguous. In a theoretical vacuum, the words “any and “all” might appear unambiguous: “all” means “every” and “any” means “all.” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 54, 97 (1976).</p>
<p id="65eb8713-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When viewed in the context of the law governing exculpatory clauses, however, this clause is ambiguous. As extensive as it is, the exculpatory clause at issue in this case is ambiguous because it did not specifically state that a member was releasing Vic Tanny for its own future negligence. Additionally, there is no question that one may never exonerate oneself from future liability for intentional torts or for gross negligence, or for activities involving the public interest. <i>See Liberty Financial Management Corp. v. Beneficial Data Processing Corp</i>., 670 S.W.2d 40, 48 (Mo. App. 1984). Yet the words used here would purport to include these claims, which cannot be waived. Although these claims were not asserted here, they demonstrate the ambiguity of the contractual language. A contract that purports to relieve a party from any and all claims but does not actually do so is duplicitous, indistinct and uncertain.</p>
<p id="65eb8714-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alack testified that he did not understand that he was releasing Vic Tanny from its own future negligence. Additionally, the twelve jurors found, as a matter of fact, that the exculpatory clause did not so release Vic Tanny. While this issue is to be decided as a matter of law, and should not have been submitted to the jury, our law on such an important point cannot be so out of step with the understanding of our citizens. The better rule is one that establishes a bright-line test, easy for courts to apply, and certain to alert all involved that the future “negligence” or “fault” of a party is being released. The words “negligence” or “fault” or their equivalents must be used conspicuously so that a <span title="501" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-501">p. 501</span>clear and unmistakable waiver and shifting of risk occurs.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10945_a395957c-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10945_a395957c-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d">4</a></span> There must be no doubt that a reasonable person agreeing to an exculpatory clause actually understands what future claims he or she is waiving.</p>

Typically, the party invoking the protection of the clause is also the party that drafted the clause and insisted upon its execution. Certainly a lack of clarity will invalidate a particular exculpatory clause. In the <i>Vic Tanny</i> case, the court demanded, as a matter of law, that the agreement expressly indicate that the claims being released included claims based upon the health club’s own negligence—the so-called <i>express negligence</i> rule. Beyond this, the court also alluded to other courts’ demands when scrutinizing releases, such as that the language be clear and unmistakable as well as conspicuous.

<p id="65ebfc63-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Theresa Riddle appeals from summary judgment denying her personal injury claim and holding that Tennessee law was applicable and that Riddle had…assumed the risk of her injury. We affirm as modified.</p>
<p id="65ebfc64-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Theresa Riddle was a cheerleader for Kansas State University during the 1983-84 and 1984-85 academic years. She signed a release to the University in 1983, but apparently signed no such release in 1984. As a condition to her participation in cheerleading, she was required to attend the Universal Sport Camp d/b/a Universal Cheerleaders Association (Universal) in Memphis, Tennessee. Bea Pray and Scott Shell supervised the cheer leading squad at the camp.</p>
<p id="65ebfc65-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In August 1984, Riddle was involved in building a “toe-touch pyramid” on which she was to be the top person. Two men from the camp gave her a boost, pushing on the bottom of her feet. The men tossed her “a little too hard,” causing her to overrotate and fall forward, missing the people on whom she was supposed to land. She fell approximately fifteen feet and landed on her face. Camp employees told her she probably had a hyperextended back and did not recommend medical treatment. The next day Riddle participated in pyramid formations despite pain and back spasms.</p>
<p id="65ebfc66-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Three days later, Riddle’s back was x-rayed, and she was diagnosed as suffering from a fractured vertebra. She received injections, medication, and therapy. She eventually was released to return to cheerleading, which she continued to do in a limited capacity to the end of the 1984-85 basketball season.</p>

<p id="65ebfc68-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court elected to apply Tennessee substantive law pursuant to <i>Brown v. Kleen Kut Mfg. Co.</i>, 714 P.2d 942 (1986) (a tort action is governed by the laws of the state where the injuries are sustained). Riddle does not raise the choice of law issue on appeal.</p>

<p id="65ebfc69-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prior to participating in the camp, Riddle signed a “Medical Treatment Form,” Section A of which provided for insurance, and Section B of which reads:</p>
<p id="65ebfc6a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“I, the undersigned parent or guardian, do hereby grant permission for my daughter/son [daughter circled] Theresa M. Riddle to attend the above Universal camp.…</p>
<p id="65ebfc6b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“I further acknowledge and understand and agree that in participating in this camp there is a possibility of physical illness or injury and that my daughter/son <i>is assuming the risk</i> of such illness or injury by his/her participation. Payment of any medical bills incurred by my daughter/son will be paid by myself or our insurance company.” (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p id="65ebfc6c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Riddle signed in her own capacity as a camper over the age of eighteen. During her deposition, Riddle stated she did not read the above section and did not intend to release Universal from liability. She acknowledged, however, that all the handwriting on the form was hers, including the circle around the word “daughter” in the exculpatory clause.</p>
<p id="65ebfc6d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Tennessee, with limited exceptions, recognizes the validity of such exculpatory clauses.</p>
<p id="65ebfc6e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The court held that because participation in a sports camp was not an area of public interest, the exculpatory clause was not void. Further, Tennessee does not require that such clauses expressly refer to a release from the defendant’s own “negligence” in order to be enforced. The court noted that Tennessee “has elected not to follow the lead of jurisdictions strictly construing exculpatory contracts against the party acting in reliance on such contracts and requiring mention of negligence in the contract. <i>Trailmobile, Inc. v. Chazen</i>, 51 Tenn. App. 576, 584; 370 S.W.2d 840 (1963). The public policy of Tennessee favors freedom to contract against liability for negligence.”]</p>
<p id="65ebfc6f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Riddle signed a statement to Universal Sport Camp expressly assuming the risk of injury and agreeing to pay medical bills herself or from insurance money. Tennessee recognizes the validity of such releases, and summary judgment is appropriate with respect to the defendant Universal.</p>

<p id="65ebfc71-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court found that Riddle expressly assumed the risk of injury when she signed the medical treatment release and liability release prior to attending camp and thus her claims were barred against all the defendants. It is uncontroverted that this release was required by Universal. The form was apparently provided by Universal; the other defendants are not named in the document nor are they claiming that they required the release.</p>
<p id="65ebfc72-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As to Universal, the release constituted a contractual release of liability under Tennessee law. As to the other defendants, the release was written evidence of Riddle’s voluntary exposure to the known dangers involved in participating in the cheerleading camp. Under Tennessee law, the assumption of risk defense is not dependent upon a contractual relationship.</p>

<p id="65ebfc73-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“At the commencement of any analysis of the doctrine of assumption of risk, we must recognize that we deal with a potpourri of labels, concepts, definitions, thoughts, and doctrines. The confusion of labels does not end with the indiscriminate and interchangeable use of the terms ‘contributory negligence’ and ‘assumption of risk.’ In the case law and among text writers, there have developed categories of assumption of risk. Distinctions exist between <i>express</i> and <i>implied;</i> between primary and secondary; and between reasonable and unreasonable or, as sometimes expressed, <i>strict</i> and <i>qualified.</i>” <i>Blackburn v. Dorta</i>, 348 So. 2d 287, 290 (Fla. 1977).</p>
<p id="65ebfc74-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In express assumption of risk, the plaintiff expressly contracts that defendant shall have no duty of care toward plaintiff. The courts continue to hold that an action for negligence is barred under these circumstances. See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Coates v. Newhall Land &amp; Farming, Inc.</i>, 236 Cal. Rptr. 181 (1987).</p>
<p id="65ec2385-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Implied assumption of risk exists when a plaintiff has impliedly consented to assume risks. Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts §68, 484 (5th ed. 1984). Implied assumption of risk is divided into primary and secondary assumption of risk. Primary assumption of risk is basically a principle of no negligence where there is no duty or no breach. <i>Blackburn v. Dorta</i>, 348 So. 2d at 290. This would include the ordinary risks of an activity where no negligence exists. Assumption of risk would still exist in that situation, but its utility is small as it could more properly be explained as non-negligence without reference to assumption of risk. Without a breach of duty by the defendant there is nothing left to compare with any misconduct of the plaintiff.</p>
<p id="65ec2386-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Secondary assumption of risk contemplates a voluntary encounter with a known and obvious risk created by the negligent conduct of another. <i>Blackburn v. Dorta</i>, 348 So. 2d at 291. It is further broken down into reasonable and unreasonable assumption of such risk. The distinction between the two is determined by weighing the utility of the conduct in comparison with the risk involved.</p>
<p id="65ec2387-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One example of a reasonable secondary assumption of risk would be a tenant who is injured when he enters his burning apartment to save his child and it is determined that the fire was due to the landlord negligently allowing the premises to become highly flammable. An example of an unreasonable secondary assumption of risk would be when a tenant, under the same circumstances, enters his burning apartment to retrieve his hat. See <i>Blackburn v. Dorta</i>, 348 So. 2d at 291.</p>
<p id="65ec2388-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Absent an express contract with the defendants other than Universal, we must determine if there was an implied assumption of risk.</p>
<p id="65ec2389-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“The elements of assumption of the risk are: (1) actual knowledge of the danger; (2) appreciation of the gravity of the danger; and (3) voluntary exposure to the danger. Knowledge of the danger can be established if the danger was so obvious that one was bound to know of it.” <i>Frazier v. Moore</i>, 651 S.W.2d at 242.</p>
<p id="65ec238a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Considering the first element, Riddle knew of the risks of injury related to cheerleading. Riddle was an experienced cheerleader in her second year for Kansas State University, this was her second year at the camp, she had moved from <span title="506" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-506">p. 506</span>alternate to full-time cheerleader in 1983 because another girl was injured, and she had also been previously injured in 1984, which required surgery.</p>
<p id="65ec238b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Likewise, Riddle’s experience would lead her to appreciate the danger (the second element) involved in any number of routines, including the “toe-touch pyramid” in which she is literally flung some ten to fifteen feet into the air, where she lands on the backs of two men who are in turn standing on the shoulders of two other men. The risk of falling is obvious.</p>
<p id="65ec238c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, Riddle voluntarily assumed the risk (the third element), as evidenced by her becoming and remaining a cheerleader, her attendance at the camps, and her written release to Universal. Riddle assumed the risk.</p>
<p id="65ec238d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Riddle contends that the defendants were negligent in not having a spotter in front of the pyramid.</p>
<p id="65ec238e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Assuming for purposes of summary judgment the defendants were negligent in failing to place a spotter in front of the pyramid, then Riddle’s assumption of risk would not be classified as an implied primary assumption of risk in which the defendant neither owes a duty to plaintiff nor is negligent.</p>
<p id="65ec238f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Secondary (reasonable or unreasonable) assumption of risk contemplates a voluntary encounter with a known and obvious risk created by the negligence of the defendant. Again, assuming the defendants were negligent in failing to place a spotter in front of the pyramid, this would have been obvious to Riddle before and during the routine, and, notwithstanding defendants’ negligence, it would be unreasonable as a matter of law for Riddle to risk a fall of approximately fifteen feet knowing there was no spotter. Under Tennessee law, the defendants’ negligence, then, would not preclude the assumption of risk defense as a bar to Riddle’s claims.</p>
<p id="65ec2390-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court correctly concluded that the risk of falling was a specific risk known to Riddle and voluntarily encountered. When undisputed facts reveal knowledge of danger and voluntary participation in the hazardous activity, there is no jury question, and judgment for the defendant is appropriate. <i>Pearce v. Canady</i>, 52 Tenn. App. at 354.</p>
<p id="65ec2391-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Summary judgment in favor of Universal based upon Riddle’s express assumption of risk is affirmed. Summary judgment in favor of the other defendants is affirmed as modified based upon Riddle’s implied assumption of risk.</p>

<p id="65ec4aaa-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The genesis of this case was a slip and fall accident which occurred on the parking lot of the Grantsville Holiday Inn in Garrett County, Maryland. Frances C. McNeal (McNeal), the respondent, sustained a broken ankle in the accident <span title="507" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-507">p. 507</span>and, as a result, sued Thomas Edward Schroyer and his wife, Patricia A. Schroyer (the Schroyers), the petitioners, in the Circuit Court for Garrett County, alleging both that they negligently maintained the parking lot and negligently failed to warn her of its condition. The jury having returned a verdict in favor of McNeal for $50,000.00 and their motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for new trial having been denied, the Schroyers appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed. In its opinion, the intermediate appellate court directly addressed the Schroyers’s primary negligence and McNeal’s contributory negligence; however, although it was properly presented, that court did not specifically address whether McNeal had assumed the risk of her injury. We issued the writ of certiorari at the request of the Schroyers and now reverse. We hold that, as a matter of law, McNeal assumed the risk of the injury. We need not and, therefore, do not, reach the other issues presented.</p>
<p id="65ec4aab-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The events surrounding McNeal’s accident and her subsequent complaint against the Schroyers are largely not in dispute. McNeal arrived at the Grantsville Holiday Inn at approximately 5:30 p.m. on January 9, 1985. At that time, although approximately four inches of sleet and ice had accumulated, she observed that the area in front of, and surrounding, the main lobby area, where hotel guests registered, had been shoveled and, thus, was reasonably clear of ice and snow. She also noticed, however, that the rest of the parking lot had neither been shoveled nor otherwise cleared of the ice and snow. McNeal parked her car in front of the hotel while she registered. While registering, she requested a room closest to an exit due to her need to “cart” boxes and paperwork back and forth to her room. She was assigned a room close to the west side entrance, which was at the far end of the hall, away from the lobby. This was done notwithstanding the hotel’s policy of not assigning such rooms during inclement weather. Also, contrary to policy, McNeal was not advised that she should not use the west entrance and, of course, no warnings to that effect were posted near that entrance.</p>
<p id="65ec4aac-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having registered, McNeal drove her car from the main entrance to within ten to fifteen feet of the west side entrance. She parked on packed ice and snow. Moreover, as she got out of her car, she noticed that the sidewalk near the entrance had not been shoveled and, furthermore, that the area was slippery. Nevertheless, she removed her cat from the car and crossed the ice and snow carefully, and without mishap. On the return trip to her car to retrieve the remainder of her belongings, she slipped and fell, sustaining the injury previously described.</p>
<p id="65ec4aad-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Concerning her knowledge of the parking lot’s condition, McNeal testified that, in the immediate vicinity of where she parked her car, the “packed ice and snow” was slippery and that, as a result, she entered the building “carefully.” She denied, however, that it was unreasonable for her, under the circumstances, to try to traverse the parking lot; she “didn’t think it was that slippery. I didn’t slip the first time in.”</p>
<p id="65ec4aae-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Schroyers moved for judgment, both at the end of McNeal’s case in chief and at the conclusion of all the evidence. That McNeal had assumed <span title="508" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-508">p. 508</span>the risk of her injury was one of the grounds advanced in support of those motions. Both motions were denied. The jury having returned its verdict in favor of McNeal, the Schroyers filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial. As in the case of the motions for judgment, they argued that respondent was barred from recovery by the doctrine of assumption of the risk. The trial court denied that motion.</p>
<p id="65ec71bf-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As indicated earlier, the Court of Special Appeals did not directly address whether McNeal assumed the risk of injury. Although it recognized that she “knew of the dangerous condition” and, presumably, acted voluntarily when she started to cross the ice and snow covered parking lot and sidewalk, the court perceived the question to be “whether she acted reasonably under the circumstances.” It concluded that whether McNeal was contributorily negligent, <i>i.e.</i>, acted reasonably in light of the known risk, was a question appropriately left to the jury for decision.</p>
<p id="65ec71c0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Assumption of the risk and contributory negligence are closely related and often overlapping defenses. They may arise from the same facts and, in a given case, a decision as to one may necessarily include the other.</p>
<p id="65ec71c1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The relationship between the defenses has also been addressed in the Restatement (Second) of Torts:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65ec71c2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The same conduct on the part of the plaintiff may…amount to both assumption of risk and contributory negligence, and may subject him to both defenses. His conduct in accepting the risk may be unreasonable and thus negligent, because the danger is out of all proportion to the interest he is seeking to advance, as where he consents to ride with a drunken driver in an unlighted car on a dark night, or dashes into a burning building to save his hat. Likewise, even after accepting an entirely reasonable risk, he may fail to exercise reasonable care for his own protection against that risk.</p></div>
<p id="65ec71c3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">§496A, comment d, at 562. The overlap between assumption of the risk and contributory negligence is a complete one where “the plaintiff’s conduct in voluntarily encountering a known risk is itself unreasonable.…” §496A, comment c 4. When that occurs, the bar to recovery is two-pronged: 1) because the plaintiff assumed the risk of injury and 2) because the plaintiff was contributorily negligent.</p>
<p id="65ec71c4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is, however, a distinction, and an important one, between the defenses of assumption of the risk and contributory negligence. That distinction was stated in <i>Warner v. Markoe</i>, 189 A.2d 260, 264 (Md. 1937), thusly:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65ec71c5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The distinction between contributory negligence and voluntary assumption of the risk is often difficult to draw in concrete cases, and under the law of this state usually without importance, but it may be well to keep it in mind. Contributory negligence, of course, means negligence which contributes to cause a particular accident which occurs, while assumption of risk of accident means voluntary incurring that of an accident which may not occur, and which the person assuming the risk may be careful to avoid after starting. Contributory negligence defeats recovery <span title="509" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-509">p. 509</span>because it is a proximate cause of the accident which happens, but assumption of the risk defeats recovery because it is a previous abandonment of the right to complain if an accident occurs.</p></div>
<p id="65ec71c6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">189 A. at 264. The distinction is no less clearly made by reference to the rationale underlying the doctrine of assumption of the risk. We explicated that rationale in <i>Gibson v. Beaver</i>, 226 A.2d 273, 275 (1967) (quoting W. Prosser, <i>Handbook of the Law of Torts</i> §55 at 303 (2d ed. 1955)):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65ec71c7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defense of assumption of risk rests upon the plaintiff’s consent to relieve the defendant of an obligation of conduct toward him, and to take his chances of harm from a particular risk. Such consent may be found:…by implication from the conduct of the parties. When the plaintiff enters voluntarily into a relation or situation involving obvious danger, he may be taken to assume the risk, and to relieve the defendant of responsibility. Such implied assumption of risk requires knowledge and appreciation of the risk, and a voluntary choice to encounter it.</p></div>
<p id="65ec71c8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>See also</i> Restatement (Second) of Torts §496A, comment d, at 562 and §496C, at 569-574. Assumption of the risk, then, “implies an intentional exposure to a known danger which may or may not be true of contributory negligence.” <i>Burke v. Williams</i>, 223 A.2d at 189.</p>
<p id="65ec71c9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether they overlap or not, the critical distinction between contributory negligence and assumption of the risk is that, in the latter, by virtue of the plaintiff’s voluntary actions, any duty the defendant owed the plaintiff to act reasonably for the plaintiff’s safety is superseded by the plaintiff’s willingness to take a chance. Consequently, unlike the case of contributory negligence, to establish assumption of the risk, negligence is not an issue—proof of negligence is not required. The plaintiff need only be aware of the risk, which he or she then voluntarily undertakes. Restatement (Second) of Torts, §496A, comment d, at 562; <i>Prosser and Keeton</i> §68 at 485-86; <i>Keenan</i>, 193 A.2d at 36; <i>Bull Steamship Lines v. Fisher</i>, 77 A.2d at 146.</p>
<p id="65ec98da-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is, in short, the willingness of the plaintiff to take an informed chance that distinguishes assumption of the risk from contributory negligence. Thus, just as the facts of a given case may warrant the same result on either theory, the facts in another may warrant conflicting results. In other words, “either may constitute a defense, with or without the other.” <i>Evans</i>, 167 A.2d at 594. A plaintiff who proceeds reasonably, and with caution, after voluntarily accepting a risk, not unreasonable in itself, may not be guilty of contributory negligence, but may have assumed the risk. <i>See Pinehurst Co. v. Phelps</i>, 163 Md. 68, 72, 160 A. 736, 737 (1932) (“A risk, while obvious, may not be so imminently dangerous that a prudent man would necessarily avoid it, yet if it shall be freely encountered it will in general be held to be so far assumed that no recovery for consequent injury is possible.”). That plaintiff may be barred from recovery on the ground of assumption of the risk, while he or she would recover were the defense theory contributory negligence.</p>

Especially is that so in the instant case. The record reflects, and the Court of Special Appeals held, a matter not in dispute on this appeal, that McNeal was fully aware of the dangerous condition of the premises. She knew that the area was ice and snow covered and that the ice and snow were slippery. Nevertheless, she parked in the area and, notwithstanding, according to her testimony, that she proceeded carefully, she took a chance and walked over the ice and snow covered parking lot and sidewalk because she did not think it was “that” slippery.</p>
<p id="65ec98dc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is clear, on this record, that McNeal took an informed chance. Fully aware of the danger posed by an ice and snow covered parking lot and sidewalk, she voluntarily chose to park and traverse it, <i>albeit</i> carefully, for her own purposes, <i>i.e.</i> her convenience in unloading her belongings. Assuming that the decision to park on the ice and snow covered parking lot and to cross it and the sidewalk was not, itself, contributory negligence, McNeal’s testimony as to how she proceeded may well have generated a jury question as to the reasonableness of her actions. On the other hand, it cannot be gainsaid that she intentionally exposed herself to a known risk. With full knowledge that the parking lot and sidewalk were ice and snow covered and aware that the ice and snow were slippery, McNeal voluntarily chose to park on the parking lot and to walk across it and the sidewalk, thus indicating her willingness to accept the risk and relieving the Schroyers of responsibility for her safety. Consequently, while the issue of her contributory negligence may well have been for the jury, the opposite is true with respect to her assumption of the risk. We hold, as a matter of law, that McNeal assumed the risk of her own injuries.</p>

Tennessee law, which applied to the case, does not follow the <i>express negligence</i> rule and the court found that this clause was clear enough, since strict scrutiny was not applied. This defense would not be applicable to the remaining defendants, including Kansas State University, as they were not parties to the contract. However, the court found that the separate doctrine of <i>secondary implied assumption of the risk</i> did apply and served as a complete bar to recovery. What were the elements of this defense?

In this limited manner, what is the difference between traditional contributory negligence and secondary implied assumption of the risk? While this variety of assumption of the risk requires subjective awareness and appreciation by the plaintiff of the risk, if the court limits its application to situations where that decision was unreasonable, contributory negligence (if still observed by the court) likewise would bar the claim; so limited, the doctrine is unnecessary baggage. However, in its traditional application, not all courts limited the doctrine in this manner. Many courts applied the doctrine regardless of how reasonable the plaintiff’s conduct may have been, so long as the remaining elements of secondary implied assumption of the risk were present—this is <i>unqualified secondary implied assumption of the risk</i>. This was true in the <i>McNeal</i> case where the court demonstrated that, even though the plaintiff’s decision to encounter the snow and ice was reasonable (according to the jury), the evidence was undisputed that she nevertheless voluntarily chose to encounter the known risk; this decision barred her claim.</p>

<p id="65ece70e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is a comparative negligence case arising out of an accident in which respondent, Alvin Davenport, was injured while descending a stairway near his apartment. We affirm as modified.</p>
<p id="65ece70f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alvin Davenport is a resident of Cotton Hope Plantation located on Hilton Head Island. The plantation is organized under state law as Cotton Hope Plantation Horizontal Regime (“Cotton Hope”). Cotton Hope is composed of ninety-six condominium units located in multiple buildings. Each building consists of three levels. The buildings have three stairways each, one in the middle and two on either side. Davenport’s unit is on the top level, approximately five feet from a stairway. Davenport leases his unit from the owner.</p>
<p id="65ece710-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Cotton Hope employed Property Administrators, Incorporated (“PAI”) to maintain the grounds at Cotton Hope Plantation. In April 1991, PAI, as Cotton Hope’s agent, hired Carson Landscaping Company, Inc., (“Carson”) to perform landscaping and general maintenance work at the condominiums. Carson’s duties included checking the outdoor lights and changing light bulbs as needed.</p>
<p id="65ece711-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In June 1991, Davenport began reporting that the floodlights at the bottom of the stairway he used were not working. Davenport testified he made several phone calls to PAI complaining about the problem. Davenport nevertheless continued to use the stairway during this time. On the evening of August 12, 1991, Davenport fell while descending the stairway closest to his apartment. Davenport testified he fell after attempting to place his foot on what appeared to be a step but was really a shadow caused by the broken floodlights. He admitted not using the handrail in the stairway.</p>
<p id="65ece712-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Davenport sued Cotton Hope for his injuries. At the close of all the evidence, the trial court directed a verdict against Davenport, finding he had assumed the risk of injury. The trial court also held that even if assumption of risk were abrogated by the adoption of comparative negligence, Davenport was more than fifty-percent negligent. Davenport appealed the trial court’s ruling.</p>
<p id="65ece713-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The threshold question we must answer is whether assumption of risk survives as a complete bar to recovery under South Carolina’s comparative negligence system. In <i>Nelson v. Concrete Supply Company</i>, 303 S.C. 243, 399 S.E.2d 783 (1991), we adopted a modified version of comparative negligence. Under this system, “for all causes of action arising on or after July 1, 1991, a plaintiff in a negligence action may recover damages if his or her negligence is not greater than that of the defendant.” <i>Nelson</i> made clear that a plaintiff’s contributory negligence would no longer bar recovery unless such negligence exceeded that of the defendant. Not so clear was what would become of the defense of assumption of risk.</p>
<span title="513" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-513">p. 513</span>
<p id="65ece714-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Currently in South Carolina, there are four requirements to establishing the defense of assumption of risk: (1) the plaintiff must have knowledge of the facts constituting a dangerous condition; (2) the plaintiff must know the condition is dangerous; (3) the plaintiff must appreciate the nature and extent of the danger; and (4) the plaintiff must voluntarily expose himself to the danger.</p>
<p id="65ece715-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As noted by the Court of Appeals, an overwhelming majority of jurisdictions that have adopted some form of comparative negligence have essentially abolished assumption of risk as an absolute bar to recovery. In analyzing the continuing viability of assumption of risk in a comparative negligence system, many courts distinguish between “express” assumption of risk and “implied” assumption of risk. <i>See</i> W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts, §68 at 496 (5th ed. 1984). Implied assumption of risk is further divided into the categories of “primary” and “secondary” implied assumption of risk. <i>Id.</i> We will discuss each of these concepts below.</p>
<p id="65ece716-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Express assumption of risk applies when the parties expressly agree in advance, either in writing or orally, that the plaintiff will relieve the defendant of his or her legal duty toward the plaintiff. Thus, being under no legal duty, the defendant cannot be charged with negligence. Even in those comparative fault jurisdictions that have abrogated assumption of risk, the rule remains that express assumption of risk continues as an absolute defense in an action for negligence. The reason for this is that express assumption of risk sounds in contract, not tort, and is based upon an express manifestation of consent.</p>
<p id="65ece717-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Express assumption of risk is contrasted with implied assumption of risk, which arises when the plaintiff implicitly, rather than expressly, assumes known risks. As noted above, implied assumption of risk is characterized as either primary or secondary. Primary implied assumption of risk arises when the plaintiff impliedly assumes those risks that are <i>inherent</i> in a particular activity. Primary implied assumption of risk is not a true affirmative defense, but instead goes to the initial determination of whether the defendant’s legal duty encompasses the risk encountered by the plaintiff. In <i>Perez</i>, the Tennessee Supreme Court summarized the doctrine in the following way:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65ed0e28-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In its primary sense, implied assumption of risk focuses not on the plaintiff’s conduct in assuming the risk, but on the defendant’s general duty of care.…Clearly, primary implied assumption of risk is but another way of stating the conclusion that a plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case [of negligence] by failing to establish that a duty exists.</p></div>
<p id="65ed0e29-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">872 S.W.2d at 902. In this sense, primary implied assumption of risk is simply a part of the initial negligence analysis.</p>
<p id="65ed0e2a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Secondary implied assumption of risk, on the other hand, arises when the plaintiff knowingly encounters a risk created by the defendant’s negligence. It is a true defense because it is asserted only after the plaintiff establishes a <i>prima facie</i> case of negligence against the defendant. Secondary implied assumption of <span title="514" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-514">p. 514</span>risk may involve either reasonable or unreasonable conduct on the part of the plaintiff.</p>
<p id="65ed0e2b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since express and primary implied assumption of risk are compatible with comparative negligence, we will refer to secondary implied assumption of risk simply as “assumption of risk.”</p>
<p id="65ed0e2c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As alluded to in <i>Litchfield</i>, assumption of risk and contributory negligence have historically been recognized as separate defenses in South Carolina. However, other courts have found assumption of risk functionally indistinguishable from contributory negligence and consequently abolished assumption of risk as a complete defense.</p>
<p id="65ed0e2d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To date, the only comparative fault jurisdictions that have retained assumption of risk as an absolute defense are Georgia, Mississippi, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and South Dakota. Only the Rhode Island Supreme Court has provided a detailed discussion of why it believes the common law form of assumption of risk should survive under comparative negligence. In <i>Kennedy v. Providence Hockey Club, Inc.</i>, 376 A.2d 329 (R.I. 1977), the Rhode Island Supreme Court distinguished between assumption of risk and contributory negligence, emphasizing the former was measured by a subjective standard while the latter was based on an objective, reasonable person standard. The court further noted that it had in the past limited the application of assumption of risk to those situations where the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the hazard. The court then rejected the premise that assumption of risk and contributory negligence overlap:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65ed0e2e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Contributory negligence and assumption of the risk do not overlap; the key difference is, of course, the exercise of one’s free will in encountering the risk. Negligence analysis, couched in reasonable hypotheses, has no place in the assumption of the risk framework. When one acts knowingly, it is immaterial whether he acts reasonably.</p></div>
<p id="65ed0e2f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Kennedy</i>, 376 A.2d at 333.</p>
<p id="65ed0e30-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rhode Island’s conclusions are in sharp contrast with the West Virginia Supreme Court’s opinion in <i>King v. Kayak Manufacturing Corp.</i>, 182 W. Va. 276, 387 S.E.2d 511 (W. Va. 1989). Like Rhode Island, the West Virginia Supreme Court in <i>King</i> recognized that assumption of risk was conceptually distinct from contributory negligence. The court specifically noted that West Virginia’s doctrine of assumption of risk required actual knowledge of the dangerous condition, which conformed with the general rule elsewhere in the country. In fact, the court cited Rhode Island’s decision in <i>Kennedy</i> as evidence of this general rule. Nevertheless, the West Virginia court concluded that the absolute defense of assumption of risk was incompatible with its comparative fault system. The court therefore adopted a <i>comparative assumption of risk</i> rule, stating, “a plaintiff is not barred from recovery by the doctrine of assumption of risk unless his degree of fault arising therefrom equals or exceeds the combined fault or <span title="515" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-515">p. 515</span>negligence of the other parties to the accident.” The court explained that the absolute defense of assumption of risk was as repugnant to its fault system as the common law rule of contributory negligence.</p>
<p id="65ed0e31-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A comparison between the approaches in West Virginia and Rhode Island is informative. Both jurisdictions recognize that assumption of risk is conceptually distinct from contributory negligence. However, Rhode Island focuses on the objective/subjective distinction between the two defenses and, therefore, retains assumption of risk as a complete bar to recovery. On the other hand, West Virginia emphasizes that the main purpose of its comparative negligence system is to apportion fault. Thus, West Virginia rejects assumption of risk as a total bar to recovery and only allows a jury to consider the plaintiff’s negligence in assuming the risk. If the plaintiff’s total negligence exceeds or equals that of the defendant, only then is the plaintiff completely barred from recovery.</p>
<p id="65ed0e32-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Like Rhode Island and West Virginia, South Carolina has historically maintained a distinction between assumption of risk and contributory negligence, even when the two doctrines appear to overlap. Thus, the pertinent question is whether a plaintiff should be completely barred from recovery when he voluntarily assumes a known risk, regardless of whether his assumption of that risk was reasonable or unreasonable. Upon considering the purpose of our comparative fault system, we conclude that West Virginia’s approach is the most persuasive model.</p>
<p id="65ed0e33-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Nelson</i>, we adopted Chief Judge Sanders’s analysis of comparative negligence [because]: “It is contrary to the basic premise of our fault system to allow a defendant, who is at fault in causing an accident, to escape bearing any of its cost, while requiring a plaintiff, who is no more than equally at fault or even less at fault, to bear all of its costs.” By contrast, the main reason for having the defense of assumption of risk is not to determine fault, but to prevent a person who knowingly and voluntarily incurs a risk of harm from holding another person liable. Cotton Hope argues that the justification behind assumption of risk is not in conflict with South Carolina’s comparative fault system. We disagree.</p>
<p id="65ed0e34-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[I]t is contrary to the premise of our comparative fault system to require a plaintiff, who is fifty-percent or less at fault, to bear all of the costs of the injury. In accord with this logic, the defendant’s fault in causing an accident is not diminished solely because the plaintiff knowingly assumes a risk. If assumption of risk is retained in its current common law form, a plaintiff would be completely barred from recovery even if his conduct is reasonable or only slightly unreasonable. In our comparative fault system, it would be incongruous to absolve the defendant of all liability based only on whether the plaintiff assumed the risk of injury. Comparative negligence by definition seeks to assess and compare the negligence of both the plaintiff and defendant. This goal would clearly be thwarted by adhering to the common law defense of assumption of risk.</p>
<span title="516" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-516">p. 516</span>
<p id="65ed0e35-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We therefore hold that a plaintiff is not barred from recovery by the doctrine of assumption of risk unless the degree of fault arising therefrom is greater than the negligence of the defendant. To the extent that any prior South Carolina cases are inconsistent with this approach, they are overruled. Express and primary implied assumption of risk remain unaffected by our decision.</p>
<p id="65ed0e36-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Cotton Hope argues that even if this Court abrogates assumption of risk as a complete defense, the trial court’s directed verdict should be upheld [because] as a matter of law, Davenport’s negligence exceeded that of Cotton Hope. We disagree.</p>
<p id="65ed0e37-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court based its ruling on the fact that Davenport knew of the danger weeks before his accident, and he had a safe, alternate route. However, there was also evidence suggesting Cotton Hope was negligent in failing to properly maintain the lighting in the exterior stairway. In the light most favorable to Davenport, it could be reasonably concluded that Davenport’s negligence in proceeding down the stairway did not exceed Cotton Hope’s negligence. Thus, it is properly submitted for jury determination.</p>

What are the essential differences? Why does the court believe that express and primary implied assumption of the risk should be unaffected by a jurisdiction’s movement from contributory negligence to comparative fault? Why does this not hold true as well (for most courts) with regard to secondary implied assumption of the risk?</p>
<p id="65ed354b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>The Rescue Doctrine Revisited.</i></b> You may recall that one of the two functions of the rescue doctrine (covered in Chapter 6, Special Duty Rules) is to invalidate any attempted application of the defense of secondary implied assumption of the risk in the case of a rescuer. Do you see how a rescuer might be deemed to have knowingly and voluntarily encountered a risk by engaging in certain rescue efforts? For this reason, the law traditionally has held that this defense should not apply to rescuers. Because most states have now shifted to comparative fault and, accordingly, eliminated the doctrine of secondary implied assumption of the risk, this aspect of the rescue doctrine has little utility. You may recall that the rescue doctrine only applied to rescuers whose decision to engage in a rescue effort was “reasonable.” With unqualified secondary implied assumption of the risk effectively abolished in most states, only unreasonable conduct applied through comparative fault would be a defense against an injured rescuer. And, by definition, whenever the rescue doctrine applies there has been no such unreasonable conduct. Accordingly, the only remaining viable defense of comparative fault would not apply anyway.</p>

<p id="65ed354e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Reflecting courts’ judgment that an express assumption of the risk can constitute private parties’ freedom to delineate their respective rights and responsibilities on private matters, courts will enforce such exculpatory clauses when they clear these two hurdles: (i) they do not touch upon public concerns, and (ii) are drafted with sufficient clarity so that there is no doubt that the agreement truly represents the intention of the plaintiff prior to the accident. Secondary implied assumption of the risk, by contrast, is premised more on the apparent inconsistency between a plaintiff knowingly and voluntarily encountering a risk created by defendant’s negligence, and then trying to hold the defendant responsible post-accident. When this decision by the plaintiff is unreasonable (i.e., qualified secondary implied assumption of the risk), it looks essentially the same as contributory negligence. As states began to abandon contributory negligence in favor of comparative fault, it made sense to eliminate qualified assumption of the risk as a separate defense doctrine. With respect to the unqualified application of the doctrine, courts appreciated the particular anomaly that would result if a plaintiff’s reasonable decision to encounter the risk created by defendant’s negligence were barred under that doctrine, even though comparative fault would not reduce the plaintiff’s award. As a result, modern courts in states that have moved to comparative fault tend to permit a defense only when the jury finds the decision unreasonable (i.e. negligent), and then this fault is apportioned. In other words, in most states today there is no longer any secondary implied assumption of the risk—only comparative fault.</p>

These are immunities to suit that exist to prevent liability for very different reasons. The first is <i>sovereign immunity</i>, a common law doctrine originally premised upon the quaint idea that “the king can do no wrong.” This doctrine, which applies to both the federal and state and local governments, has some exceptions that are frequently the subject of litigation. There are also <i>intrafamilial immunities</i> that have existed, both (a) between spouses and (b) between parents and their children.</p>

<p id="65ed5b6d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This appeal requires us to interpret the “discretionary function” exception to the Federal Tort Claims Act’s general waiver of sovereign immunity. The District Court dismissed a wrongful death complaint against the United States, finding that the discretionary function exception to the Federal Tort Claim Act’s waiver of sovereign immunity, 28 U.S.C. §2680(a), applied. We will reverse.</p>
<p id="65ed5b6e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The underlying facts are undisputed. In December 1993, Daniele Cestonaro, his wife Giovanna, and their daughter, all Italian citizens and residents, were vacationing in St. Croix, Virgin Islands. On the evening of December 28, the Cestonaros parked their rental car in a lot on Hospital Street in Christiansted. Upon returning to their car after dinner, the Cestonaros were confronted by two armed gunmen. Daniele Cestonaro was shot and died almost immediately.</p>
<p id="65ed5b6f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Hospital Street lot falls within the boundaries of the Christiansted National Historic Site owned and controlled by the United States Department of the Interior, National Park Service. At the time of the murder, the Hospital Street lot was not an official parking lot. There were no signs designating or even indicating that it was a parking lot; it was neither paved nor striped. The lot’s appearance, however, differed from the surrounding area in the Christiansted National Historic Site in terms of grade and surface, as it consisted of broken asphalt from a previous paving. Since the 1940s, the general public had used the Hospital Street lot as a parking area. Furthermore, the National Park Service was aware that crimes had occurred in the lot before December 28, 1993. In addition to crime incidents reports from the Virgin Island Police Department and its own park rangers, the National Park Service also received regular complaints about safety in the Hospital Street lot from local business owners.</p>
<p id="65ed5b70-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is undisputed that the National Park Service had done nothing to deter nighttime parking in the Hospital Street lot. It had not posted signs prohibiting parking, nor signs warning of dangers of nighttime parking, nor issued tickets for illegal parking. In fact, the lot was lighted at night. Some time after the lot came into the government’s possession, five lights were installed illuminating the Hospital Street lot. It is undisputed the National Park Service maintained those lights.</p>
<p id="65ed5b71-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Giovanna Cestonaro filed a wrongful death action against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act and the Virgin Islands Wrongful Death Statute. In her complaint, Mrs. Cestonaro alleged that “defendant was negligent in <span title="519" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-519">p. 519</span>failing to provide adequate lighting and correct the known dangerous condition and to warn others about the existence of the dangerous condition” at the Hospital Street lot. The United States filed a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) asserting the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the challenged National Park Service actions fell under the discretionary function exception to the FTCA’s waiver of sovereign immunity.</p>
<p id="65ed5b72-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District Court dismissed the complaint, finding the National Park Service’s decisions concerning the Hospital Street lot were grounded in its mission to “safeguard the natural and historic integrity of national parks” and in its policy “to minimally intrude upon the setting of such parks.” Mrs. Cestonaro appealed.</p>
<p id="65ed5b73-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Federal Tort Claims Act is a partial waiver of the sovereign immunity that would otherwise protect the United States from tort liability stemming from the actions of its employees. The express purpose of the FTCA is to make the United States liable “in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.…” 28 U.S.C. §2674. But the FTCA’s waiver is tempered by several exceptions. For our purposes, the relevant exception is the “discretionary function exception” that withdraws the waiver of sovereign immunity with regard to:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65ed5b74-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Any claim based upon…the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government whether or not the discretion involved be abused.</p></div>
<p id="65ed5b75-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">28 U.S.C. §2680(a).</p>
<p id="65ed5b76-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The exception “marks the boundary between Congress’ willingness to impose tort liability upon the United States and its desire to protect certain governmental activities from exposure to suit by private individuals.” <i>United States v. S.A. Empresa de Viação Aérea Rio Grandense (Varig Airlines)</i>, 467 U.S. 797 (1984). The FTCA does not, however, define “discretionary function.” As a result there has arisen a trove of case law identifying the contours of the government’s tort liability.</p>
<p id="65ed5b77-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The analytical framework of the discretionary function exception has been laid out by the Supreme Court in a trilogy of cases—<i>United States v. S.A. Empresa de Viação Aérea Rio Grandense (Varig)</i>, 467 U.S. 797 (1984); <i>Berkovitz v. United States</i>, 486 U.S. 531 (1988); and <i>United States v. Gaubert</i>, 499 U.S. 315 (1991).</p>
<p id="65ed5b78-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first issue is whether “a federal statute, regulation, or policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an employee to follow.” <i>Berkovitz</i>, 486 U.S. at 536. If so, the exception cannot apply. If not, the question is whether the governmental action or inaction “is of the kind that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield.” Id. If it is, the action constitutes the exercise of protected discretion, and the United States is immune from suit.</p>
<p id="65ed5b79-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The touchstone of the second step of the discretionary function test is susceptibility to policy analysis. As we have previously stated, a plaintiff’s claim can <span title="520" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-520">p. 520</span>only survive if “the challenged actions cannot ‘be grounded in the policy of the regulatory regime.’” <i>Gotha</i>, 115 F.3d at 179. The Court in <i>Gaubert</i> underscored the importance of the relationship between the discretionary decision and policy considerations, noting the exception applies only if the challenged actions can “be said to be based on the purposes that the regulatory regime seeks to accomplish.”</p>
<p id="65ed5b7a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before proceeding to apply the discretionary function analysis to the facts of this case, there is one remaining preliminary issue—we must identify the challenged action. In effect, plaintiff challenges the National Park Service’s decisions concerning lighting and warning in the Hospital Street lot.</p>
<p id="65ed828b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As noted, the first step in our analysis is whether there was discretion over the challenged action, that is, whether a federal regulation or policy specifically prescribes a course of action. Plaintiff contends the National Park Service, by virtue of a 1985 agreement with the Virgin Islands, had no discretion with respect to the Hospital Street lot. According to the plaintiff, the 1985 Addendum mandated the removal of the Hospital Street lot by 1988, thereby eliminating any National Park Service discretion.</p>
<p id="65ed828c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District Court addressed the argument in two ways. First, it expressed skepticism that the 1985 Addendum constituted the kind of mandate that prevented the government’s recourse to the discretionary function exception. Second, it held the plaintiff did not allege negligence on the part of the National Park Service for failing to close the parking lot, but rather for failing to provide adequate lighting or to warn of known dangers associated with nighttime parking in the lot.</p>
<p id="65ed828d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given the qualification “subject to the availability of funds” [within the Addendum, this] does not appear to be the kind of express mandate that precludes coverage by the discretionary function exception. <i>See, e.g., Berkovitz</i>, 486 U.S. at 536 (“The discretionary function exception will not apply when a federal statute, regulation, or policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an employee to follow.”). Here, the National Park Service’s determination whether there were funds available seems to be the kind of judgment or choice inherent in the discretionary function exception.</p>
<p id="65ed828e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But we need not determine whether the 1985 Addendum eliminates the National Park Service’s discretion regarding the use of the Hospital Street lot. We agree with the District Court that the 1985 Addendum does not mandate a specific course of conduct and cannot be dispositive with respect to lighting and warning decisions in the Hospital Street lot. The lighting and warning decisions here, therefore, remain discretionary.</p>
<p id="65ed828f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But this does not end our inquiry. We must determine whether the discretionary lighting and warning decisions are susceptible to policy analysis and therefore enjoy the protection of the discretionary function exception. <i>See, e.g., Gaubert</i>, 499 U.S. at 322-23 (“Even assuming the challenged conduct involves an element of judgment, it remains to be decided whether that judgment is of the kind that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield.”).</p>
<span title="521" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-521">p. 521</span>
<p id="65ed8290-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The National Park Service contends its decisions (or non-decisions) not to add lighting nor to post warning signs were grounded in its overarching objective of returning the area to its historic appearance. The government points to several documents to ground this policy concern. First, it relies on the original 1952 Memorandum of Agreement, which established the National Historic Site with the purpose of preserving the integrity of the historic structures and grounds. It also points to a 1972 Memorandum of Agreement which recited that its “basic objective in the management of Christiansted National Historic Site is to retain the architectural and historical integrity of the structures and their environment.” The National Park Service also argues it is not expressly required to add lighting or post warning signs in the Hospital Street lot.</p>
<p id="65ed8291-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The National Park Service’s arguments are inapposite. It may be arguable that the initial decision to maintain parking at the Hospital Street lot was protected by the discretionary function exception. But assuming this were so, subsequent decisions concerning the Hospital Street lot were not necessarily protected. <i>See, e.g., Indian Towing Co., Inc. v. United States</i>, 350 U.S. 61 (1955); <i>George v. United States</i>, 735 F. Supp. 1524 (M.D. Ala. 1990).</p>
<p id="65ed8292-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Indian Towing involved alleged negligence by the United States Coast Guard in its failure to properly maintain the light on a lighthouse it had established. Despite the Coast Guard’s claim of sovereign immunity, the Court found the United States could be held liable under the FTCA for the negligent operation of the lighthouse even though the initial decision to establish a lighthouse was discretionary. The Court explained</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65ed8293-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Coast Guard need not undertake the lighthouse service. But once it exercised its discretion to operate a light on Chandeleur Island and engendered reliance on the guidance afforded by the light, it was obligated to use due care to make certain that the light was kept in good working order; and, if the light did become extinguished, then the Coast Guard was further obligated to use due care to discover this fact and to repair the light or give warning that it was not functioning. If the Coast Guard failed in its duty and damage was thereby caused to petitioners, the United States is liable under the Tort Claims Act.</p></div>
<p id="65ed8294-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Indian Towing Co</i>., 350 U.S. at 69.</p>
<p id="65ed8295-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>George</i>, a District Court rejected the National Forest Service’s attempt to invoke the discretionary function exception when Mr. George was attacked by an alligator while swimming in a recreational swimming area designated by the Forest Service. The court held that although the decision to establish the swimming area was discretionary, the subsequent failure to warn the public of known dangers was not covered by the exception.</p>
<p id="65ed8296-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if there was protected discretion for the National Park Service’s decision to maintain parking at the Hospital Street lot, that does not answer whether subsequent decisions were also protected.</p>
<p id="65ed8297-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The National Park Service fails to show how providing some lighting, but not more, is grounded in the policy objectives with respect to the management <span title="522" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-522">p. 522</span>of the National Historic Site. Similarly, the National Park Service has not presented a viable argument as to how its alleged failure to warn is rooted in its policy objectives.</p>
<p id="65ed8298-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, we see no tension between our decision and those reached in the cases cited. Under proper circumstances, the National Park Service may balance aesthetic and safety interests and avoid liability through the discretionary function exception. To properly invoke an aesthetic interest, there must be a reasonable relationship between that interest and the challenged action.</p>
<p id="65eda9a9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our view, plaintiff’s suit does not put the District Court in the position of second guessing a National Park Service administrative decision that is “grounded in social, economic, and political policy.” We are unable to find a rational nexus between the National Park Service’s lighting or warning decisions (or non-decisions) and social, economic and political concerns. Nor will plaintiff’s claim seriously impede the National Park Service’s proper functions or operations.</p>
<p id="65eda9aa-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the reasons stated, we hold the discretionary function exception does not apply to the National Park Service’s decisions concerning the Hospital Street lot. We will reverse the judgment of the District Court and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

It used to be that, at the federal government level, citizens hurt due to government neglect would petition a local congressman to try to get a bill passed by Congress permitting their particular claim. Eventually Congress decided to pass a broad statutory waiver called the Federal Tort Claims Act (“FTCA”):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65eda9ae-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he district courts…shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the United States, for money damages…for injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death caused by the neglect or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.</p></div>

One major restriction on this waiver of immunity is the so-called <i>discretionary function exception</i> (“DFE”), which states that the waiver in §1346(b)(1) does not apply to any claim “based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved be abused.” 28 U.S.C. §2680(a) (2009).</p>

Furthermore, there is no liability for strict liability torts or intentional torts. Finally, all suits under the FTCA are within the federal courts’ exclusive subject matter jurisdiction, and the claimant is not entitled to a jury trial. How can such limitations be constitutional? Because the federal government need not permit <i>any</i> suits (and none were permitted at common law when the U.S. Constitution was adopted), and so such limitations are permissible. In other words, it is only by the grace of the king that any suit at all may be maintained.</p>

First, in many states the common law has evolved into a dichotomy between <i>governmental</i> vs<i>. proprietary</i> services of the government. That is, when a state or local government is performing a service or task that is considered governmental, immunity from suit exists; however, it does not exist when the government is performing in a proprietary capacity. In at least some states, the lack of a coherent way to determine what is proprietary and what is governmental has caused some wholesale reexamination of the immunity doctrine.</p>

<p id="65edd0ce-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These cases were consolidated for the purposes of appeal. The facts in the two cases are somewhat different, but the outcome of both is dependent on the same question of law. The cases were decided separately in the Court of Appeals and were consolidated upon transfer to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p id="65edd0cf-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the <i>Campbell</i> case the appellants sustained personal injuries as a result of a head-on collision with an automobile traveling in appellant’s lane of traffic upon a state-maintained highway. In their complaint appellants alleged negligence on the part of the state in that, after repaving the highway, it failed to: (a) mark with a yellow line the aforesaid State Road 221 where it is unsafe to pass; and (b) carelessly and negligently failed to install no passing signs along Road 221 or any other signs indicating to the traveling public that the public highway was unsafe for passing. Appellants also contended that the road as maintained constituted a nuisance.</p>
<p id="65edd0d0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the <i>Knotts</i> case, the appellant sued the City of Indianapolis and the State of Indiana complaining that he sustained $100,000 in damages because of personal injuries incurred as the result of a fall on a crosswalk in Indianapolis. Appellant alleged that the injuries were the result of the negligent state of repair of the crosswalk. The fall occurred on the crosswalk at the intersection of Market Street and Monument Circle in Indianapolis. Monument Circle is a part of the state highway system and as such, the State of Indiana is responsible for its care and maintenance. In both <i>Campbell</i> and <i>Knotts</i> the state filed a motion to dismiss in the trial court alleging that there was no basis upon which relief could be granted premised upon the doctrine of sovereign immunity. In both cases the trial court sustained the motion and the Court of Appeals affirmed the rulings. Thereafter, both appellants petitioned this court for transfer to resolve the status of the doctrine of sovereign immunity in Indiana.</p>
<p id="65edf7e1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both the <i>Campbell</i> and <i>Knotts</i> briefs raise the issue of whether the State of Indiana still recognizes the common law doctrine of sovereign immunity. The doctrine in its present form is a far cry from the original common law principle which exempted the sovereign from liability in court on the basis that “the king could do no wrong.” The doctrine has been amended and eroded until the most that remains is an abstract and confusing principle which finds literally no continuity between jurisdictions. The purpose for which the doctrine was created has long since vanished and it is now time to finally reexamine the basis of the rule.</p>
<p id="65edf7e2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The original adoption of the doctrine in America following the Revolutionary War was founded on the premise that the new government was not financially secure enough to face claims of negligence in its governmental activities. Therefore, the English Common Law was adopted and the same immunity which protected the King from liability was adopted to protect the states. <span title="525" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-525">p. 525</span>The first inroad in Indiana to limit the doctrine occurred in the case of <i>City of Goshen v. Myers</i> (Ind. 1889), 21 N.E. 657, where the court held that:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65edf7e3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our opinion, it was the duty of the city of Goshen to keep the bridge under consideration in repair. The public bridges within the limits of the cities of the State, located upon the streets and public highways of the cities—and such cities, where they take charge of the same, are liable to persons suffering injury or loss.…”</p></div>

<p id="65edf7e5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Out of early forms of municipal liability grew the current governmental-proprietary standard which has been applied to the state and its subdivisions. This is in essence a court-made distinction as to the types of activities which governmental bodies perform, created to ameliorate the harshness of total governmental immunity. It is generally held that if a governmental body is negligent in performing a proprietary function, it will be liable for its negligence; while, if its activity is classified as governmental, the defense of sovereign immunity shall apply.</p>
<p id="65edf7e6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Exactly what constitutes a proprietary function as opposed to a governmental function has never been clearly enunciated by the courts, and this failure to establish a criteria has led to the generally confused state of the bench and bar in the application of the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Deciding on useful guidelines between rather obscure, whimsical notions enunciated by the appellate courts throughout the country has caused enormous conflicts in the courts in the past decade. However, the fact that the doctrine is beyond the scope of explicit definition has not halted its application. In the case of <i>Flowers v. Board of Commissioners of County of Vanderburgh</i> (Ind. 1960), 168 N.E.2d 224, this court held, in regard to appellant recovering for injuries sustained in a skating rink operated by the county and for use of which admission was charged [that the defendant was liable to the plaintiff because its activity was proprietary rather than governmental in nature].</p>
<p id="65edf7e7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Further erosion of the doctrine followed in the case of <i>Brinkman v. City of Indianapolis</i> (Ind. 1967), 231 N.E.2d 169, in which the Appellate Court abolished the right of a city to claim the defense of sovereign immunity regardless of whether the nature of the act was governmental or proprietary. The court reasoned:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65edf7e8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The governmental-proprietary rule, however, often produces legalistic distinctions that are only remotely related to the fundamental considerations of municipal tort responsibility. As for example, it does not seem to be good policy to permit the chance that a school building may or may not be producing rental income at the time determine whether a victim may recover for a fall into a dark and unguarded basement stairway or elevator shaft. Neither does it seem to be good policy to find that a municipal garbage truck is engaged in a <i>nonimmune</i> proprietary function when en route from a wash rack to the garage while the same truck is engaged in an <i>immune</i> governmental function when enroute to a garbage pickup.</p>
<p id="65edf7e9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The extent to which a municipal corporation should be held liable for torts committed by its officers or employees in the course of the employment is a perplexing problem that has been the subject of litigation on many occasions. There has been a general apprehension that fraud and excessive litigation would result in <span title="526" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-526">p. 526</span>unbearable cost to the public in the event municipal corporations were treated as ordinary persons for purposes of tort liability. On the other hand the unfairness to the innocent victim of a principle of complete tort immunity and the social desirability of spreading the loss—a trend now evident in many fields—have been often advanced as arguments in favor of extending the scope of liability. It is doubtful whether the purposes of tort law are well served by either the immunity rule or its exceptions. After careful consideration we are of the opinion that <i>the doctrine of sovereign immunity has no proper place in the administration of a municipal corporation</i>.” (Emphasis added)</p></div>
<p id="65edf7ea-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Id.</i> at 172.</p>
<p id="65ee1efb-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The next logical step was taken in the case of <i>Klepinger v. Board of Commissioners</i> (Ind. 1968), 239 N.E.2d 160. The court abrogated immunity for all counties in Indiana. In the aftermath of <i>Klepinger</i> all that remained was immunity to the state. The court in <i>Klepinger</i> made it clear that the governmental-proprietary distinction was to be completely disregarded in cases involving city or county immunity.</p>
<p id="65ee1efc-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Perkins</i> v. <i>State</i> (1969), 252 Ind. 549, 251 N.E.2d 30, the Supreme Court utilized the governmental-proprietary function to limit the application of the doctrine on the state level. In <i>Perkins</i>, the appellants fell ill due to the contamination of a lake with raw sewage. They had rented a lakeside cottage in a state park for which the maintenance thereof was the duty of the state. The trial court sustained the state’s motion to dismiss on the ground that the court did not have jurisdiction due to the sovereign immunity of the state. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that such operation was a proprietary activity, and, therefore, the state could not avail itself of the immunity privilege. Following the holding in <i>Perkins</i>, all that remained of sovereign immunity was immunity on the part of the state from negligent acts occurring while the state was in performance of a solely “governmental function.” Exactly what a governmental function constituted was not yet clearly defined.</p>
<p id="65ee1efd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With only a mere fraction of the original doctrine remaining, we are faced with the task of attempting to eliminate the confusion surrounding the doctrine.</p>
<p id="65ee1efe-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The argument has been presented that elimination of the doctrine of sovereign immunity will impose a disastrous financial burden upon the state. Assuming there is any relevancy to this contention, we point out that the abrogation of sovereign immunity on the state level is consistent with conditions already existing in cities and counties in this state. If city and county governments can withstand the consequences of such liability, where traffic hazards seemingly are greater, the state should be able to also bear such burden.</p>
<p id="65ee1eff-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We may also add that the elimination of sovereign immunity means a more equitable distribution of losses in society caused by the government unto members of society, rather than forcing individuals to face the total loss of the injury.</p>
<p id="65ee1f00-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The state argues that abolition of sovereign immunity will result in a great number of problems for the state. Inability to collect payment for claims against the state, inability of the state to secure adequate insurance, and prospective legal chaos are cited as examples of some of these problems. The arguments <span title="527" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-527">p. 527</span>which the state presents are questions which properly belong to the legislature in facing and solving the problems of liability.</p>
<p id="65ee1f01-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not mean to say by this opinion that all governmental units can be held liable for any and all acts or omissions which might cause damage to persons. For example, one may not claim a recovery because a city or state failed to provide adequate police protection to prevent crime. <i>Simpson’s Food Fair v. City of Evansville</i> (Ind. 1971), 272 N.E.2d 871. Nor may one recover damages because a state official made an appointment of an individual whose incompetent performance gives rise to a suit alleging negligence on the part of the state official for making such an appointment. Likewise the United States Supreme Court has recognized a judicial immunity. <i>Pierson v. Ray</i> (1967), 386 U.S. 547. On this subject matter Professor Prosser, in his treatise, stated the following:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65ee1f02-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the very outset it was more or less obvious that some vestige of the governmental immunity must be retained. It was, for example unthinkable that either state [or] a municipality should be held liable for a wrong decision of its courts, for an erroneous evaluation of property by a tax assessor. In several of the decisions abrogating the immunities, there was language used which reserved the possibility that there might still be immunity as to ‘legislative’ or ‘judicial’ functions, or as to acts or omissions of government employees which were ‘discretionary.’</p></div>
<p id="65ee1f03-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prosser, <i>Law of Torts</i> §131, at 986 (4th ed. 1971.)</p>
<p id="65ee1f04-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Therefore, it appears that in order for one to have standing to recover in a suit against the state there must have been a breach of duty owed to a private individual.</p>
<p id="65ee1f05-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finding no basis for the continuation of the doctrine of sovereign immunity as applicable to the state any more than it is applicable to municipal corporations and counties, we hold that such a defense by the state is not available to any greater extent than it is now available to municipal corporations and counties of this state. Judgment of the trial court is reversed with directions to vacate by ruling on the motion to dismiss in each case and to enter an order overruling such motion and for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>

<p id="65ee1f08-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Proprietary vs. Governmental</i>.</b> Though Indiana repudiated this common law distinction, many states still retain the rule that immunity at the state and local level exists for governmental functions but not proprietary functions. The standard for judging between the two is often vague. For example, here is one court’s articulation of the test: “[W]hether in providing such services, the governmental entity is exercising the powers and duties of government conferred by law for the general benefit and well being of its citizens.” Edwards v. City of Portsmouth, 375 S.E.2d 747, 750 (Va. 1989). This is an incredibly nebulous test that affords little predictability in deciding, for <span title="528" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-528">p. 528</span>example, whether an ambulance service run by a municipality is proprietary or governmental. In such states where this dichotomy still prevails, one can only be safe in finding published decisions that are on point.</p>
<p id="65ee1f09-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Statutory Waiver at the State/Local Level</i>.</b> Even for activities that are governmental, a state might have statutes that permit partial waivers of immunity. Unlike the FTCA, which provides a broad waiver of immunity subject to some exceptions (like the DFE), most states retain a broad immunity with statutes that provide limited waivers. For example, many state waivers of immunity apply where someone’s injury arises out of the state government’s use of real or personal property. Much litigation ensues, of course, over what such phrases actually mean. Again, it is imperative to resort to the decisional law of such jurisdictions to understand the application of such statutes.</p>

<p id="65ee461c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">At common law, one spouse was not permitted to sue the other in tort. In application, this rule of law was applied if the tort claim arose during the marriage or if the spouses were married at the time of the lawsuit’s filing. So entrenched was this rule that even after the demise of the original justification—that the wife was indistinct from her husband—courts continued to apply this doctrine based upon new justifications. In most states, this immunity has been abolished, in whole or in part, for reasons similar to those set forth below in <i>Price.</i> The court’s discussion and abandonment of the doctrine exemplifies the process by which an antiquated tort doctrine eventually passes away. With respect to parental immunity, though the doctrine has less bite than it used to have, most courts continue to recognize some vitality in the limited doctrine. As you read the next two cases, consider why most courts have rejected spousal immunity but continue to give credence to some level of parental immunity.</p>

<p id="65ee4625-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case presents us with the opportunity to re-examine the validity of the doctrine of interspousal immunity. The case originated as a civil action of negligence for personal injuries brought by Kimberly Parmenter Price against her husband, Duane Price. Duane Price’s motion for summary judgment was granted. The court of appeals affirmed that judgment. We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand this cause to the trial court.</p>
<span title="529" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-529">p. 529</span>
<p id="65ee4626-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In July of 1983, Kimberly Parmenter, at the time a <i>feme sole</i>, was injured when a motorcycle on which she was riding collided with a truck. The motorcycle was driven by Duane Price. Six months after the accident, Duane and Kimberly were married. After marriage, Kimberly brought this action seeking recovery from her husband, Duane, and from the driver of the truck, claiming that the negligence of these drivers had caused her injuries. The driver of the truck and his employer settled. The trial court, in granting summary judgment for Duane, relied on the doctrine that one spouse could not sue another for negligent conduct.</p>
<p id="65ee4627-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The doctrine of interspousal immunity is a part of the common law, having been judicially created. Its origins are shrouded in antiquity, but the basis of the doctrine is <i>“that a husband and wife are one person.” Firebrass v. Pennant</i>, 2 Wils. 255, 256 (C.P. 1764) (emphasis in original).</p>
<p id="65ee4628-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A woman’s disability during coverture was an essential ingredient in fostering the doctrine. As was stated in <i>Thompson v. Thompson</i>, 218 U.S. 611, 614-15 (1910):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65ee4629-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At common law the husband and wife were regarded as one,—the legal existence of the wife during coverture being merged in that of the husband; and, generally speaking, the wife was incapable of making contracts, of acquiring property or disposing of the same without her husband’s consent. They could not enter into contracts with each other, <i>nor were they liable for torts committed by one against the other</i> (emphasis added).</p></div>
<p id="65ee462a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An earlier thesis on American law expanded the concept of superiority of the husband over the wife even to the extent of restraining her liberty or disciplining her. 2 Kent’s Com. 174 (8th ed. 1854). While in this, the last quarter of the twentieth century, such views seem preposterous, recognition that those views were prevalent in the law makes easily understandable why suits by wives against husbands were not permitted.</p>
<p id="65ee462b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, the husband/wife unity argument as grounds for the doctrine was severely impeded by the adoption of what were known as Married Women Acts. These legislative acts occurred principally in the latter half of the nineteenth century and early twentieth century. These acts, while varying from state to state, generally gave wives the rights to own, acquire and dispose of property; to contract; and, to sue in respect to their property and contracts. Most importantly, many of the statutes specifically abolished the doctrine of the oneness of husband and wife.</p>
<p id="65ee462c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With the demise of the legal fiction of the merger of husband and wife into a single entity, the doctrine of interspousal immunity found support in considerations of marital harmony, as well as the potential for collusive lawsuits. Restatement (Second) of Torts §895F, comment d (1979).</p>
<p id="65ee462d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">American jurisdictions, in upholding the doctrine, early on espoused the premise that a civil suit by one spouse against another would destroy the harmony of the home. One court, in a fire and brimstone opinion upholding the <span title="530" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-530">p. 530</span>prohibition against suits between spouses, foresaw all manner of evil should the immunity doctrine be terminated. In <i>Ritter v. Ritter</i>, 31 Pa. 396 (1858), that court, while observing that a favorite maxim at common law was that marriage makes a man and woman one person at law, also said:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65ee462e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nothing could so complete that severance [of the marriage relationship] and degradation, as to throw open litigation to the parties. The maddest advocate for woman’s rights, and for the abolition on earth of all divine institutions, could wish for no more decisive blow from the courts than this. The flames which litigation would kindle on the domestic hearth would consume in an instant the conjugal bond, and bring on a new era indeed—an era of universal discord, of unchastity, of bastardy, of dissoluteness, of violence, cruelty, and murders.</p></div>
<p id="65ee462f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second argument for barring interspousal suits, the possibility of collusive lawsuits, is entirely inconsistent with the subjugation of wife to husband and preservation of happy homes theses. Nevertheless, such inconsistency did not seem to trouble the courts. The possibility of collusion was alluded to in <i>Abbott v. Abbott</i>, 67 Me. 304 (1877), where it was suggested that a widow could raid her deceased husband’s estate by claiming all sorts of wrongs by him during his lifetime. The fraud theory expanded into vogue with the advent of insurance to cover vehicular accidents. In <i>Newton v. Weber</i>, 119 Misc. Rep. 240, 196 NYS 113, 114 (1922), the court said of allowing a tort action by a wife against her husband, “the maintenance of an action of this character, unless the sole purpose be a raid upon an insurance company, would not add to conjugal happiness and unison.”</p>
<p id="65ee6d40-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Without ascribing any reasons for doing so, Texas adopted the doctrine of interspousal immunity one hundred years ago in <i>Nickerson and Matson v. Nickerson</i>, 65 Tex. 281 (1886). <i>Nickerson</i> barred all civil actions for tort between husband and wife.</p>

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65ee6d47-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Stress has been laid upon the danger of fictitious and fraudulent claims, on the very dubious assumption that a wife’s love for her husband is such that she is more likely to bring a false suit against him than a genuine one; and likewise the possibility of trivial actions for minor annoyances, which might well be taken care of by finding consent to all ordinary fictions of wedlock—or at least assumption of risk! The chief reason relied upon by all these courts, however, is that personal tort actions between husband and wife would disrupt and destroy the peace and harmony of the home, which is against the policy of the law. This is on the bald theory that after a husband has beaten his wife, there is a state of peace and harmony left to be disturbed; and that if she is sufficiently injured or angry to sue him for it, she will be soothed and deterred from reprisals by denying her the legal remedy.</p></div>
<p id="65ee6d48-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prosser, <i>Law of Torts</i>, §122 at 863 (4th ed. 1971). While it is true that part of this quote involves intentional rather than negligent torts, the arguments in favor of interspousal immunity are generally equally applicable, and lacking, as to both. It is difficult to fathom how denying a forum for the redress of any wrong could be said to encourage domestic tranquility. It is equally difficult to see how suits based in tort would destroy domestic tranquility, while property and contract actions do not.</p>
<p id="65ee6d49-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As to the potential for fraud and collusion, we are unable to distinguish interspousal suits from other actions for personal injury.

We now abolish that doctrine completely as to any cause of action. We do not limit our holding to suits involving vehicular accidents only, as has been done by some jurisdictions and as has been urged upon us in this case. To do so would be to negate meritorious claims such as was presented in <i>Stafford v. Stafford</i>, 726 S.W.2d 14 (Tex. 1987). In that case a husband had transmitted a venereal disease to his wife, resulting in an infection that ultimately caused Mrs. Stafford the loss of her ovaries and fallopian tubes, ending for all time her ability to bear children. While we ruled for her, the issue of interspousal immunity had not been preserved for our review. To leave in place a bar to suits like that of Mrs. Stafford or other suits involving non-vehicular torts would amount to a repudiation of the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws. This we will not do.</p>

The parents of Ramero did not have uninsured motorist insurance, but did have a homeowner’s insurance policy which they believed would pay a judgment that might be obtained by the minor child against the parents.</p>

The superior Court of Maricopa County granted the parents’ motion for summary judgment based upon the doctrine of parental immunity.</p>
<p id="65ee946b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The principles of parental immunity were formulated in the landmark case of <i>Hewlett v. George (Ragsdale)</i>, 9 So. 885 (1891). In that case the Mississippi Supreme Court stated the following rationale:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65ee946c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The peace of society, and of the families composing society, and a sound public policy, designed to subserve the repose of families and the best interests of society, forbid to the minor child a right to appear in court in the assertion of a claim to civil redress for personal injuries suffered at the hands of the parent.</p></div>
<p id="65ee946d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case has been followed by a majority of state courts because of the need to preserve family unity and prevent collusion between family members against their insurance companies. See Annotation, Liability of Parent for Injury to Unemancipated Child Caused by Parent’s Negligence, 41 A.L.R.3d 904. However, with the advent of the automobile and the increasing presence of insurance, a minority of jurisdictions has abrogated parental immunity where the minor has been injured as a result of the negligent driving of a parent. E.g., <i>Hebel v. Hebel</i>, 435 P.2d 8 (Alaska 1967); <i>Briere v. Briere</i>, 224 A.2d 588 (N.H. 1966); <i>Goller v. White</i>, 122 N.W.2d 193 (Wisc. 1963). Prior to 1970, Arizona clearly followed <i>Hewlett</i>, supra, see <i>Purcell v. Frazer</i>, 435 P.2d 736 (1967), but in 1970 we overruled <i>Purcell</i>, and partially abrogated the immunity doctrine in the case of <i>Streenz v. Streenz</i>, 471 P.2d 282 (Az. 1970). Both the <i>Purcell</i> and <i>Streenz</i> cases involved minor children injured in automobile accidents through the negligent driving of a parent. Our two reasons for abrogating parental immunity in <i>Streenz</i> were: (1) That the common law has long allowed suits by a child against a parent in property and contract actions. Therefore, it is reasonable that the law should protect the rights of the child in a personal injury action as well. (2) The existence of liability insurance to compensate the plaintiff, particularly in automobile accident cases, negates the possibility of disrupting family unity. After balancing the potential for disruptive suits against the need to compensate injured parties, we held that the minor child could sue her parents for injuries sustained through the negligent driving of her mother. We did not, however, abolish the doctrine in its entirety. We stated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65eebb7e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our holding today is not a total abrogation of the parental immunity doctrine.

<p id="65eebb7f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Streenz</i> we cited with approval <i>Goller v. White</i>, supra, which held that parents would not be immune from suit in personal injury actions brought by their children against them <i>except</i> in two situations:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65eebb80-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(1) Where the alleged negligent act involves an exercise of parental authority over the child; and (2) where the alleged negligent act involves an exercise of ordinary parental discretion with respect to the provision of food, clothing, housing, medical and dental services, and other care. <i>Goller v. White</i>, supra, 20 Wis. 2d at 413, 122 N.W.2d at 198.</p></div>
<p id="65eebb81-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Streenz</i> we also cited with approval a later case of the same Wisconsin court. <i>Lemmen v. Servais</i>, 158 N.W.2d 341 (Wisc. 1968). In <i>Lemmen</i>, a child was injured when she was struck by a car after she alighted from a school bus. The child sued the driver of the car, who then filed a third-party claim against the parents for contribution to any recovery obtained by the child. The basis of the driver’s claim was that the parents were negligent in failing to properly instruct their child on safety procedures in crossing the street. The court held that the second exception stated in <i>Goller</i>, supra, applied to make the parents immune from suit, because they were acting within their discretion as parents with respect to the “other care” of their child. The court stated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65eebb82-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The two exceptions set forth in <i>Goller</i> are directed toward preserving, fostering and maintaining a proper and wholesome parent-child relationship in a family. The immunity granted by these two exceptions is accorded the parent, not because he is a parent, but because as a parent he pursues a course within the family constellation which society exacts of him and which is beneficial to the state. The parental nonliability is not granted as a reward, but as a means of enabling the parents to discharge the duties which society exacts.</p></div>
<p id="65eebb83-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Lemmen</i>, at 343-344.</p>
<p id="65eebb84-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Streenz</i>, we did not delineate precisely the areas in which parental immunity would continue to be a bar to suit by a minor for the negligence of his parents, though it is apparent that automobile cases are ones in which the doctrine of parental immunity is abolished. This, however, is not an automobile case in the usual sense in that the parent’s obligation did not arise out of his driving of an automobile. The direct cause of Ramero’s injuries was the impact of the Perez automobile, not the act of leaving the gate open. We distinguish this act from the act of the parents in <i>Streenz</i>, supra, in which the parent, as a driver, had a duty to the world at large to drive carefully. If an accident resulted because of the parent’s negligent driving, any passenger in the vehicle could have been injured, and the driver should be liable to that passenger regardless of the fact that the passenger is the child of the driver.</p>
<p id="65eebb85-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A case with similar facts is the Illinois case of <i>Cummings v. Jackson</i>, 372 N.E.2d 1127 (Ill. App. 1978).

This obstructed the view of a driver who ran over the minor child. The Illinois Court of Appeals stated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65eebb86-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[A] suit charging a breach of a duty owed the general public is not as disruptive to a family unity as one charging breach of duty owed primarily to family members and thus bringing into contention the inner workings of the family.</p>
<p id="65eebb87-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the instant case the duty alleged to have been breached by the mother concerned the maintenance of trees on the area immediately adjacent to the home. The duty was owed primarily to the general public, however, and only incidentally to the members of the family living in the house. Although the question is a close one, we conclude that the injury to plaintiff was not alleged to arise out of the family relationship.</p></div>

<p id="65eebb89-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We believe that <i>Cummings</i> is distinguishable from the instant case in that the mother had a duty to the public (imposed by city ordinance) to keep the trees trimmed, and insofar as her failure was the proximate cause of the minor child’s injuries, she could be liable. In the instant case, the closing of the gate was a duty owed to the child alone and a part of the parental “care and control” or “other care” to be provided by the parents.</p>

The doctrine’s original rationale was conceptual and based upon a legal fiction—that the husband and wife were one person (i.e., the husband). While that flawed premise eventually became too obvious to ignore, courts continued to recognize the doctrine based upon one of two inconsistent premises: (1) that the suit was a legitimate legal dispute between the spouses and would destroy the marriage; or (2) that the suit was a fraudulent attempt to reach into the pockets of an insurance policy. Why did the court in <i>Price</i> determine that neither of these arguments supported the doctrine any longer?</p>
<p id="65eee2a3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Partial Abrogation of Parental Immunity</i>.</b> Courts have frequently mentioned similar concerns regarding a child’s suit against her parent—disruption to family harmony and the potential for insurance fraud. Yet notwithstanding this similarity, most courts continue to recognize at least a limited version of the parental immunity doctrine. Notice in <i>Sandoval</i> that the court makes a distinction between cases involving negligent driving or negligent tree maintenance and those involving alleged negligent supervision of the children. Given this distinction, what seems to be the remaining concern with completely abrogating parental immunity?</p>
<p id="65eee2a4-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Parental Discipline Privilege and Immunity</i>.</b> The <i>Sandoval</i> court was concerned with whether a negligence claim might still be covered by immunity. When a parent spanks a child or places the child in “time out,” what prevents the child from suing for an intentional tort? Courts have long held that there is a privilege or immunity for such conduct—that would otherwise qualify as an intentional tort—so long as it involves the good faith use of reasonable force or imposition of punishment in a way that is necessary to control, train, and educate the child. As one court described this immunity to discipline:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65ef09b5-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not every spanking is a battery and not every ‘time out’ in one’s bedroom is a false imprisonment. The parent’s prerogative to exercise authority and attend to a child’s needs must be exercised within reasonable limits. When her conduct so far exceeds the discharging of normal parental duties and responsibilities, the public policies of peace, tranquility and discipline in the home are no longer served by this doctrine of immunity.</p></div>
<p id="65ef09b6-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Brozdowski v. Southern Conn. Gas Co., 192 Conn. Super. LEXIS 2534 (Conn. Sup. 1992). In extreme cases of unreasonable punishments, neither the court nor agencies of the state have a problem declaring the conduct extreme and wrongful and offering sanctions in the forms of civil tort suits, criminal prosecution, or other regulatory sanctions such as removing the child from the home. Might spanking become so taboo that eventually this immunity will no longer permit such battery to occur?</p>

<p id="65ef30cf-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Advising a client that her otherwise strong tort claim is barred because the target defendant is immune from a civil lawsuit can be daunting. Most lay people are shocked to hear of the concept of civil immunity. While some immunities have ancient origins, whether or not the immunity will have modern vitality often depends upon whether currently acceptable alternative justifications exist. “The king can do no wrong” might suffice in the eighteenth century, but twentieth-century Americans would not tolerate such a rationale for federal governmental immunity. Instead, the concept of not using taxpayer funds to benefit isolated individuals can instead justify the doctrine. And while few states cling to spousal immunity, most still recognize a legitimate need to continue to protect certain uniquely parental decisions from judicial oversight or second-guessing.</p>

<p id="65ef30d2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Like the immunity defenses and unlike comparative fault, statutes of limitation defenses have nothing to do with the factual merits of the lawsuit. Even the best tort claim will be “dead on arrival” if filed in an untimely manner. Every civil cause of action, including all tort claims, has a limited shelf life as set by a statute. Many personal injury claims, for example, must be brought within two or three years. Many defamation claims are time-barred after one year. Lawyers must be careful in several respects when planning their tort litigation. First, a careful understanding of the applicable statute is required to ensure that <span title="538" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-538">p. 538</span>counsel knows exactly what starts the running of the clock. Second, counsel must be aware of the availability of (and the limits on) equitable doctrines that are sometimes utilized by courts to provide additional time to bring a claim. When applicable, these equitable doctrines can stop the clock for a period of time. Finally, counsel also needs to distinguish between a statute of <i>limitation</i> and a statute of <i>repose</i>; the latter sometimes has harsh results by declaring a claim time-barred before the plaintiff even owns a tort cause of action.</p>

<p id="65ef7efd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is a frivolous appeal. We also note that there is a strong indication in the record that counsel for the appellant ineptly and perhaps negligently handled his client’s case. Counsel for the appellant failed to file suit before the applicable statute of limitations had run. We are disappointed when members of our State Bar betray the trust and confidence of their clients by engaging in careless and unprofessional practice.</p>
<p id="65ef7efe-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On February 8, 1979, Wanda Crumpton underwent surgery at Llano Estacado Medical Center in Hobbs. She alleged that she sustained injuries to her neck and legs when an attending nurse attempted to lower her hospital bed on February 11, 1979. Her suit was filed more than three years later on February 15, 1982. The trial court granted a motion for summary judgment on the ground that the suit was barred by the three-year statute of limitations. Crumpton now appeals and argues that the exact date of her injury may not be ascertainable.</p>
<p id="65ef7eff-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Crumpton argues that her injury was not ascertainable until some time after the accident occurred. Further, she contends that the statute of limitations should have been tolled during the time the parties were negotiating.</p>
<p id="65efa610-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These arguments are entirely without merit. In her deposition, Crumpton plainly testified that her injuries occurred on February 11, 1979. She also testified that she is still having problems in her shoulders, legs and sides which she attributed to the February 11, 1979 incident. Crumpton offers no evidence to contradict the fact that the alleged negligent act and injury occurred simultaneously on February 11, 1979. In our view, the fact that she had continuing treatments and hospitalizations after the injury does not necessarily make the date of the injury unascertainable.</p>
<p id="65efa611-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under…the general three-year statute of limitations, Section 37-1-8, Crumpton’s suit is barred.

<p id="65efa613-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Crumpton cites no authority for her argument that the statute of limitations should be tolled during the time when the parties were negotiating a settlement. The record indicates that defendants did not fraudulently lead Crumpton to believe that the case would be settled at some future date. In fact, the record indicates that in May 1981, defendants sent Crumpton a letter wherein defendants made a final offer for a compromise settlement of the case.</p>
<p id="65efa614-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, we affirm the trial court’s grant of summary judgment against Crumpton.

<p id="65efcd2e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">R. intervened in her parents’ divorce proceeding, alleging that her father, S., was negligent by sexually abusing her until she was seventeen years old. (Given the sensitive nature of these allegations, we refer to the parties only by initials to avoid the use of proper names.) Because R. did not sue her father within two years of her eighteenth birthday as required by the applicable statutes of limitations, her action is barred as a matter of law unless the discovery rule permits her to sue within two years of when she knew or reasonably should have known of the alleged abuse. R. contends that the discovery rule should apply in this case because she repressed all memory of her father’s abuse until about a month after she turned twenty, some three months before she intervened in the divorce action. The district court directed a verdict against R. on the grounds that the discovery rule does not apply in this case, and that R. adduced no evidence of abuse. A divided court of appeals reversed and remanded for a new trial. We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and affirm the judgment of the district court on limitations grounds.</p>
<p id="65efcd2f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before we review the evidence in this case it is important to have clearly in mind the issue that is crucial in determining whether to apply the discovery <span title="540" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-540">p. 540</span>rule.

<p id="65efcd30-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have long recognized the salutary purpose of statutes of limitations. In <i>Gautier v. Franklin</i>, 1 Tex. 732, 739 (1847), we wrote that statutes of limitations are justly held</p>

<p id="65efcd31-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">as statutes of repose to quiet titles, to suppress frauds, and to supply the deficiencies of proof arising from the ambiguity, obscurity and antiquity of transactions. They proceed upon the presumption that claims are extinguished, or ought to be held extinguished whenever they are not litigated in the proper forum at the prescribed period. They take away all solid ground of complaint, because they rest on the negligence or laches of the party himself; they quicken diligence by making it in some measure equivalent to right.…</p></div>

<p id="65efcd33-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More recently, we explained:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65efcd34-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Limitations statutes afford plaintiffs what the legislature deems a reasonable time to present their claims and protect defendants and the courts from having to deal with cases in which the search for truth may be seriously impaired by the loss of evidence, whether by death or disappearance of witnesses, fading memories, disappearance of documents or otherwise. The purpose of a statute of limitations is to establish a point of repose and to terminate stale claims.</p></div>
<p id="65efcd35-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Murray v. San Jacinto Agency, Inc.</i>, 800 S.W.2d 826, 828 (Tex. 1990).</p>
<p id="65efcd36-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The enactment of statutes of limitations is, of course, the prerogative of the Legislature. At the time this case was filed and tried, the applicable statute was the one governing personal injury actions generally, which provided: “A person must bring suit for…personal injury…not later than two years after the day the cause of action accrues.” Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §16.003(a). The code contains two other provisions relevant to this case. One is: “If a person entitled to bring a personal action is under a legal disability when the cause of action accrues, the time of the disability is not included in the limitations period.” Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §16.001(b). The other is: “For the purposes of this subchapter, a person is under a legal disability if the person is: (1) younger than 18 years of age.” <i>Id</i>. §16.001(a). Thus, a person has until his or her twentieth birthday (or the next business day, §16.072) to bring suit for personal injury from sexual assault if—and here we come to the root of the problem in the case before us—the cause of action “accrued” while the person was a minor.</p>
<p id="65efcd37-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many other statutes peg the beginning of the limitations period on the date the cause of action “accrues.” Occasionally the date of accrual is defined. <i>E.g.</i>, Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §16.003(b) (a wrongful death cause of action “accrues on the death of the injured person”). More often, however, the definition of accrual is not prescribed by statute and thus has been left to the courts. As a rule, we have held that a cause of action accrues when a wrongful act <span title="541" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-541">p. 541</span>causes some legal injury, even if the fact of injury is not discovered until later, and even if all resulting damages have not yet occurred. <i>Trinity River Auth. v. URS Consultants, Inc.</i>, 889 S.W.2d 259, 262 (Tex. 1994). We have not applied this rule without exception, however, and have sometimes held that an action does not accrue until the plaintiff knew or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known of the wrongful act and resulting injury.</p>
<p id="65eff448-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accrual of a cause of action is deferred in two types of cases. In one type, those involving allegations of fraud or fraudulent concealment, accrual is deferred because a person cannot be permitted to avoid liability for his actions by deceitfully concealing wrongdoing until limitations has run. The other type, in which the discovery rule applies, comprises those cases in which “the nature of the injury incurred is inherently undiscoverable and the evidence of injury is objectively verifiable.” These two elements of inherent undiscoverability and objective verifiability balance the conflicting policies in statutes of limitations: the benefits of precluding stale or spurious claims versus the risks of precluding meritorious claims that happen to fall outside an arbitrarily set period. Restated, the general principle is this: accrual of a cause of action is deferred in cases of fraud or in which the wrongdoing is fraudulently concealed, and in discovery rule cases in which the alleged wrongful act and resulting injury were inherently undiscoverable at the time they occurred but may be objectively verified. This principle, while not expressed in every deferred accrual case, is derived from them and best defines when the exception to the legal injury rule has been and should be applied.</p>
<p id="65eff449-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have considered the “inherently undiscoverable” element of the discovery rule in several cases. <i>Willis</i>, 760 S.W.2d at 645 (lawyer’s error could not be discovered by client who was ignorant of the law); <i>Nelson</i>, 678 S.W.2d at 923 (malpractice in muscular dystrophy gene screening could not be discovered by parents until child showed symptoms); <i>Kelley</i>, 532 S.W.2d at 949 (false credit report could not be discovered until credit denied); <i>Hays</i>, 488 S.W.2d at 414 (“One who undergoes a vasectomy…and then after tests is told that he is sterile, cannot know that he is still fertile…until either his wife becomes pregnant or he is shown to be fertile by further testing.”); <i>Gaddis</i>, 417 S.W.2d at 578 (“it is often difficult, if not impossible, to discover that a foreign object has been left within the body within the statutory period of limitation”). The common thread in these cases is that when the wrong and injury were unknown to the plaintiff because of their very nature and not because of any fault of the plaintiff, accrual of the cause of action was delayed.</p>
<p id="65eff44a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To be “inherently undiscoverable,” an injury need not be absolutely impossible to discover, else suit would never be filed and the question whether to apply the discovery rule would never arise. Nor does “inherently undiscoverable” mean merely that a particular plaintiff did not discover his injury within the prescribed period of limitations; discovery of a particular injury is dependent not solely on the nature of the injury but on the circumstances in which it occurred and plaintiff’s diligence as well. An injury is inherently undiscoverable <span title="542" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-542">p. 542</span>if it is by nature unlikely to be discovered within the prescribed limitations period despite due diligence.</p>
<p id="65eff44b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have also considered the “objectively verifiable” element of the rule in a number of cases. In <i>Gaddis</i>, a patient claimed that her doctors were negligent in leaving a sponge inside her body after surgery. The presence of the sponge in her body—the injury—and the explanation for how it got there—the wrongful act—were beyond dispute. The facts upon which liability was asserted were demonstrated by direct, physical evidence. In contrast, <i>Robinson</i> involved a claim by a patient against his doctors for misdiagnosis of his back condition. We summarized the issue this way:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65eff44c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff, to prove his cause of action, faces the burden of proving both a mistake in professional judgment and that such mistake was negligent. Expert testimony would be required. Physical evidence generally is not available when the primary issue relevant to liability concerns correctness of past judgment. Unlike <i>Gaddis v. Smith</i> there exists in the present case no physical evidence which in-and-of-itself establishes the negligence of some person. What physical evidence was to the cause of action alleged in <i>Gaddis v. Smith</i>, expert testimony is to the cause of action in the present case. Even the fact of injury is a matter of expert testimony.</p></div>
<p id="65eff44d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Expert testimony, we concluded, did not supply the objective verification of wrong and injury necessary for application of the discovery rule.</p>
<p id="65eff44e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the present case plaintiff R. claims that her father sexually abused her and that she unconsciously repressed all memory of it for years. If the legal injury rule were applied, R.’s claims against S. would each have accrued on the date the alleged incident of abuse occurred. In applying the statute of limitations, however, the years of her minority are not included. In effect, then, under the legal injury rule, R. is in the same position as if her claims all accrued on her eighteenth birthday and limitations began to run on that date, expiring about four months before she filed suit. R.’s claims are therefore barred unless she is entitled to an exception to the legal injury rule. R. does not allege fraud or fraudulent concealment, nor could she. R. was not deceived into thinking that she was not being abused when she was. To the contrary, R.’s contention is that she was fully aware of the episodes of abuse, so painfully so that she repressed all memory of them for years. Thus, for accrual to be deferred the discovery rule must apply. For the discovery rule to apply, R.’s claim must have been inherently undiscoverable within the limitations period and objectively verifiable.</p>
<p id="65eff44f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have twice held a fiduciary’s misconduct to be inherently undiscoverable. <i>Willis</i>, 760 S.W.2d at 645 (attorney); <i>Slay</i>, 187 S.W.2d at 394 (trustee). The reason underlying both decisions is that a person to whom a fiduciary duty is owed is either unable to inquire into the fiduciary’s actions or unaware of the need to do so. While a person to whom a fiduciary duty is owed is relieved of the responsibility of diligent inquiry into the fiduciary’s conduct, so long as that relationship exists, when the fact of misconduct becomes apparent it can no longer be ignored, regardless of the nature of the relationship. Because parents <span title="543" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-543">p. 543</span>generally stand in the role of fiduciaries toward their minor children, <i>see Thigpen v. Locke</i>, 363 S.W.2d 247, 253 (Tex. 1962), R. was not obliged to watch for misconduct by her father as long as she was a minor. Again, however, R. does not claim to have been misled.</p>
<p id="65eff450-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nevertheless, given the special relationship between parent and child, and the evidence reviewed in detail below that some traumas are by nature impossible to recall for a time, we assume without deciding that plaintiff can satisfy the inherent undiscoverability element for application of the discovery rule. We therefore focus on the second element of objective verifiability. The question is whether there can be enough objective verification of wrong and injury in childhood sexual abuse cases to warrant application of the discovery rule.</p>
<p id="65eff451-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The literature on repression and recovered memory syndrome establishes that fundamental theoretical and practical issues remain to be resolved. These issues include the extent to which experimental psychological theories of amnesia apply to psychotherapy, the effect of repression on memory, the effect of screening devices in recall, the effect of suggestibility, the difference between forensic and therapeutic truth, and the extent to which memory restoration techniques lead to credible memories or confabulations. Opinions in this area simply cannot meet the “objective verifiability” element for extending the discovery rule.</p>
<p id="65eff452-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, we conclude that the discovery rule does not apply in this case.</p>
<p id="65f01b63-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not, of course, impose any additional requirements on proof of a childhood sexual abuse case brought within the applicable limitations period. The objective verifiability requirement of the discovery rule does not apply in proving the case on the merits.</p>
<p id="65f01b64-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor are we insensitive to the terrible wrong of childhood sexual abuse and the strong public policies condemning it as reflected in the criminal statutes. False accusations of abuse are equally devastating to families, however. As several state legislatures have already realized, the law must approach these difficult cases with an appreciation of all the interests affected. We believe the best approach is to apply the discovery rule in the same manner that we have applied it today…and would apply it in any other case.</p>

<p id="65f01b68-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Interpreting the Word “Accrue.”</i></b> When analyzing any statute of limitation issue, it is important to understand that the judicial history of interpreting a particular statute may impact its meaning in a significant way. Many statutes of limitation—which are frequently phrased to run from the time a claim “accrues”—are interpreted in light of the <i>legal injury rule</i>. This means, as the court held above, that because a cause of action is complete when injury has occurred, the claim accrues upon the happening of the physical injury <span title="544" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-544">p. 544</span>regardless of whether the plaintiff realizes she has been injured. <i>See e.g.</i>, Rod v. Farrell, 291 N.W.2d 568 (Wis. 1980) (interpreting the medical malpractice statute of limitation use of the word “accrue” to refer to the date of the injury and finding the claim barred even though plaintiff had no way to discover the claim until 17 years later). Sometimes, however, a court will interpret a statute of limitation to implicitly incorporate a discovery rule so that the claim does not “accrue” under it until the plaintiff knew or should have known he had a possible claim. <i>See e.g.</i>, Hanley v. Citizens Bank of Massachusetts, 2001 W.L. 717106 (Mass. Super. 2001) (interpreting a statute of limitation that granted a plaintiff “three years after the cause of action accrues” to mean the plaintiff had until three years after an event took place that would “reasonably likely put the plaintiff on notice that someone may have caused her injury”). Some statutes of limitation expressly incorporate a discovery rule into the text of the statute. For example, Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §16.010 provides that in a claim for misappropriation of trade secrets, the claim must be brought within “three years after the misappropriation is discovered or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have been discovered.” What is significant is that a lawyer should not assume, in the absence of express statutory language, that a client is entitled to the benefit of a discovery rule.</p>
<p id="65f01b69-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Alternative Definitions of “Accrue” in Statutes.</i></b> Sometimes the legislature will draft particular statutes of limitation that expressly contain an alternative definition for when the claim accrues. For example, many wrongful death claims are governed by statutes of limitation that expressly state that the claim accrues on the death of the injured person. In cases where, following an accident, the primary victim does not die for an extended period of time, the normal time to file suit could significantly increase.</p>
<p id="65f01b6a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Limitations in Repressed Sexual Abuse Cases.</i></b> Other courts have reached similar conclusions as the Texas Supreme Court did in <i>S.V.</i> For example, in Doe v. Maskell, 679 A.2d 1087, 1093 (Md. 1996), the court found that plaintiff’s claims of repressed memory of sexual abuse as a minor by a chaplain at a parochial school were barred by the applicable statute of limitations and that the discovery rule was inapplicable: “[W]e are unconvinced that repression exists as a phenomenon separate and apart from the normal process of forgetting. Therefore we hold that the mental process of repression of memories of past sexual abuse does not activate the discovery rule.”</p>

<p id="65f04280-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Statutes of limitation typically run from the date a cause of action “accrues,” which is either the date of injury (damage or legal injury being the last element of a tort cause of action) or, when the discovery rule applies, the date that the plaintiff knew or should have known of a possible claim. Sometimes the legislature is concerned that a case might be filed against a defendant long after the defendant’s conduct giving rise to the claim has occurred. This could happen if the defendant’s negligence sets in motion a sequence of events that does not harm the plaintiff for many years. For example, if you negligently exposed your workers to asbestos but it did not result in injury for two decades, a worker’s suit against you might still be timely under a two-year statute of limitation so long as the sick worker filed suit soon after becoming ill. Or, in cases where the discovery rule is applied to a statute of limitation, the plaintiff’s lengthy delay in bringing suit might be justified where the plaintiff’s injury was inherently undiscoverable for a period of time.</p>
<p id="65f04281-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For these reasons, legislatures sometimes will craft a <i>statute of repose</i>—an additional or alternative requirement for bringing a suit within a period of time running from the date of a particular event, such as the date of the defendant’s negligence. These are increasingly enacted in many states for medical malpractice cases, product liability cases, and construction defect cases. Although the terms of the particular statutes ultimately guide the analysis, courts typically find that the discovery rule is inapplicable to statutes of repose. To apply a discovery rule would undermine the definite deadline offered by such a statutory scheme. In this instance, the only avenue around missing such a deadline might be through the doctrine of <i>fraudulent concealment</i>—that the defendant concealed the existence of the claim. The <i>Kern</i> case below discusses this equitable tolling doctrine in a statute of repose scenario. Statutes of repose also raise the possibility that someone might be barred from bringing a claim based upon a deadline that had already passed prior to the plaintiff even being injured or owning a cause of action. Efforts to attack the unconstitutionality of such statutes of repose are often difficult, as we will see.</p>

<p id="65f06998-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This medical malpractice action is before us on writ of certiorari. [Plaintiff’s decedent Dale Kern appealed from the affirmance of the trial court’s summary judgment in favor of defendants Dr. Doyle Simmons and X-Ray Associates based upon the statute of repose.] We reverse the Court of Appeals and the trial court.</p>
<p id="65f06999-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dale Kern received external beam radiation therapy for cancer of the bladder at St. Joseph Hospital in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The treatments were administered by defendant Dr. Simmons, an employee of defendant-respondent, X-Ray Associates, from August 16, 1977, through September 22, 1977. Kern and his wife were told by Dr. Simmons that Kern’s therapy would consist of 30 treatments of radiation. After Kern had received 25 treatments, however, the therapy was discontinued without explanation. When Kern and his wife asked Dr. Simmons the reason for the early termination of the therapy, Dr. Simmons did not respond and appeared to stare off in the other direction. After the radiation treatments, Kern experienced problems with frequency of urination and the passing of blood in his bowel movements and urine. Kern died on August 30, 1982. The cause of death listed on the death certificate was sepsis-urinary tract infection due to or as a consequence of irradiation cystitis and proctitis and/or urinary bladder cancer.</p>
<p id="65f0699a-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both Kern and his wife believed that the problems Kern experienced after the radiation therapy were acceptable complications of the treatments. They were never informed that Kern had received an excessive amount of radiation. However, after reading a newspaper article in 1981 regarding excessive radiation having allegedly been administered at St. Joseph Hospital, they began to suspect the propriety of Kern’s treatment. Kern and his wife employed a lawyer to investigate whether Kern’s radiation therapy had been administered properly.</p>
<p id="65f0699b-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This lawsuit was filed on March 21, 1983, by Kern’s widow in her capacity as personal representative of her husband’s estate. She alleged that her husband’s death was due to the negligent administration and calculation of external beam radiation therapy. Dr. Simmons and X-Ray Associates filed a motion for summary judgment contending that petitioner’s lawsuit was barred by NMSA 1978, Section 41-5-13. The trial court and the Court of Appeals agreed.</p>
<p id="65f0699c-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 41-5-13 requires that a claim be filed “within three years after the date that the act of malpractice occurred.…” Petitioner argues that there is no malpractice until there is injury and that the statute, therefore, should not start to run until the injury has manifested itself in a physically objective manner and is ascertainable. She argues that <i>Peralta v. Martinez</i>, 564 P.2d 194 (N.M. Ct. App.), <i>cert. denied</i>, 567 P.2d 485 (1977) and the general rules of statutory construction compel such an interpretation. We disagree.</p>
<p id="65f0699d-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prior to the enactment of the Medical Malpractice Act in 1976, malpractice actions were governed by the general statute of limitations applicable to all <span title="547" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-547">p. 547</span>personal injury actions, NMSA 1953, Section 23-1-8, which is now NMSA 1978, Section 37-1-8. This statute reads, in applicable part, “for an injury to the person or reputation of any person, within three years.” Primarily because of the use of the word “injury,” <i>Peralta</i> interpreted this statute of limitations “to run from the time the injury manifests itself in a physically objective manner <i>and</i> is ascertainable.” <i>Peralta v. Martinez</i> at 394, 564 P.2d at 197 (emphasis in original). <i>Peralta</i> is not controlling in the present case, therefore, for two reasons. First, it construes a different statute of limitations. Second, Section 41-5-13 makes no reference to “injury” or any such comparable term. In fact, <i>Peralta</i> recognized this significant wording difference between the general statute of limitations it was construing and NMSA 1953, Section 58-33-13 (Int. Supp. 1976), the precursor of Section 41-5-13.</p>
<p id="65f0699e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree with the Court of Appeals that the meaning of Section 41-5-13 is clear and unambiguous. If the language of a statute is not ambiguous, the literal meaning of the words must be applied. The statute clearly starts to run from the time of the occurrence of the act giving rise to the cause of action. Since we find the meaning of this statute unambiguous, there is no need to resort to rules of construction.</p>
<p id="65f0699f-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We recognize that this statute may be harsh when applied to latent injury cases. Although the “wrongful act rule,” as our type of statute has become known, was once the general rule, it is now generally disfavored and many states have enacted some form of discovery provision which typically provides for the cause of action not to accrue until the patient discovers or should have discovered the injury. Any changes to our statute, however, should be made by the Legislature and not by the courts.</p>
<p id="65f069a0-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the present case, petitioner’s lawsuit was filed more than three years after Kern’s last radiation treatment and is barred by Section 41-5-13 unless the statute was tolled by the doctrine of fraudulent concealment. New Mexico recognizes the doctrine of fraudulent concealment in medical malpractice actions. <i>Hardin v. Farris</i>, 530 P.2d 407 (N.M. Ct. App. 1974). The doctrine is based not upon a construction of the statute, but rather upon the principle of equitable estoppel. The theory is premised on the notion that the one who has prevented the plaintiff from bringing suit within the statutory period should be estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense.</p>
<p id="65f069a1-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Hardin</i>, the court recognized the estoppel nature of fraudulent concealment and stated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="65f069a2-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We therefore conclude that where a party against whom a cause of action accrues prevents the one entitled to bring the cause from obtaining knowledge thereof by fraudulent concealment…the statutory limitation on the time for bringing the action will not begin to run until the right of action is discovered, or, by the exercise of ordinary diligence, could have been discovered.</p></div>

The statute of limitations, however, is not tolled if the patient knew, or through the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known, of his cause of action within the statutory period. If tolled by fraudulent concealment, the statute commences to run again when the patient discovers, or through the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the malpractice.</p>

<p id="65f08fb7-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To toll the statute of limitations under the doctrine of fraudulent concealment, a patient has the burden, therefore, of showing (1) that the physician knew of the alleged wrongful act and concealed it from the patient or had material information pertinent to its discovery which he failed to disclose, <i>and</i> (2) that the patient did not know, or could not have known through the exercise of reasonable diligence, of his cause of action within the statutory period.</p>
<p id="65f08fb8-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When we consider the record, we find that petitioner did present sufficient evidence to raise an issue of material fact regarding Dr. Simmons’ knowledge of excessive radiation having been administered to Kern. The record reveals that in opposition to [defendants’] motion for summary judgment, [Kern] presented the affidavit of a doctor knowledgeable in the field of therapeutic radiology who stated that although the intended treatment plan for Kern conformed with the customary standards at that time, the dose levels given did not follow the plan and were greatly excessive and that such dose levels “will cause unacceptable complications such as those recorded in the medical records as being suffered by Dale Kern, deceased.” In addition, the affidavit of a radiation physicist stated, “Whoever calculated the treatment times needed to implement this treatment plan performed a <i>gross calculation error</i>.” (Emphasis added.) Petitioner also presented her own affidavit which contained the facts set forth at the beginning of this opinion.</p>
<p id="65f08fb9-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In support of his motion for summary judgment, Dr. Simmons filed an affidavit denying knowledge of any malpractice and denying concealment of any material facts. Resolving, however, all doubts in favor of petitioner, we find the evidence sufficient to create a fact issue. The early termination of the treatments without explanation, Dr. Simmons’ failure to answer the Kerns’ question concerning the early termination, and the statements in the affidavits filed by petitioner lend possible support to petitioner’s claims of excessive radiation having been given to Kern, and of “a gross calculation error” having been made in implementing Kern’s treatment plan.</p>

<p id="65f08fbd-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. <i>Statute of Repose.</i></b> Statutes of repose are intended to operate in a stricter fashion than statutes of limitation. This is often accomplished in one of two ways. First, the statute often begins the running of the deadline from a more specific date, such as the date of the alleged medical malpractice, the date a manufacturer sold a product, or the date a construction project was completed. Second, such statutes are generally considered to be exempt from possible application of any discovery rule, unless the plaintiff facing a possibly stale claim is able to plead and prove fraudulent concealment as in <i>Kern.</i></p>
<p id="65f08fbe-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Fraudulent Concealment.</i></b> As discussed by the court in <i>Kern</i>, fraudulent concealment might consist of the defendant affirmatively covering up information that would reveal a cause of action, perhaps by lying to the plaintiff about certain facts. On the other hand, where there is a fiduciary or special relationship between the parties, fraudulent concealment is possible where the defendant is merely silent. Either way, courts generally hold that the equitable doctrine of fraudulent concealment can be a defense to the application of either a statute of limitation or a statue of repose. By contrast, the discovery rule typically is only available (if at all) as a defense to a statute of limitation.</p>
<p id="65f0b6cf-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Constitutionality of Statutes of Repose.</i></b> Some plaintiffs particularly aggrieved by the harsh application of a statute of repose have challenged its legality, either under a due process or equal protection argument. One noteworthy example is Sedar v. Knowlton Construction Co., 551 N.E.2d 938 (Ohio 1990) in which the plaintiff was injured in a dormitory at Kent State University. In 1985, his arm was injured in a panel of wire-reinforced glass due to alleged faulty design and construction. Unfortunately for the plaintiff, the trial court dismissed his lawsuit filed less than two years later because of the applicable statute of repose for cases involving construction or improvement defects. This statute of repose precluded all claims brought “more than ten years after…the furnishing [of construction] services.” Because the dormitory was completed in 1966, all claims for defective construction were required to be brought by 1976—nine years before plaintiff was even hurt. The only way the plaintiff’s suit could have been timely was to bring it nearly a decade before he had any injuries. Of course, no such suit was possible then. Nevertheless, the court upheld the statute as a rational exercise of the legislature’s power to limit the liability of architects and builders to “encourage [them] to experiment with new designs and materials.” By contrast, in Kennedy v. Cumberland Engineering Co., 471 A.2d 195 (R.I. 1984), the Rhode Island Supreme Court held unconstitutional a 10-year statute of repose for product manufacturers—the statute required all claims to be brought within 10 years of the initial sale of the product. The plaintiff was first injured by defendant’s product 9 years after its <span title="550" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-550">p. 550</span>initial sale; plaintiff had no way of discovering when the product was first sold until after filing suit several years later and obtaining the sales history of the product during discovery. The court held that such harsh application—even to the point where one might not be injured until long after the deadline for suits had passed—violated the right to a forum guaranteed by the state constitution, stating: “[A] product with a life expectancy much greater than ten years can unfairly enjoy a total immunity from the effect of its defect for a great part of the product’s useful life. The application of this statute to this plaintiff is no less harsh and unjust.” <i>Id</i>. at 200.</p>

<li class=""><p id="65f0b6d3-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A month after the actual conversation with their doctor about the abrupt termination of Mr. Kern’s radiation, Mr. Kern overhears a nurse say, “I sure hope none of our patients were hurt from their exposure to radiation.” Mr. Kern is not completely sure what this means and is concerned, but he fails to inquire about it any further.</p></li></ol>

The transformation of a good tort claim into one fraught with a technical deficiency is not only a cause for concern for the lawyer, but also for the lawyer’s legal malpractice insurance carrier. Whether as a plaintiff’s lawyer trying to screen a new case to be sure it is still viable, or as a defense lawyer reading a new complaint and trying to identify possible affirmative defenses, all trial lawyers need to be able to accurately determine the timetable during which a particular claim must be filed. Generalities will not suffice. Instead, counsel needs to isolate the applicable statute, determine if it is a statute of limitation or a statute of repose, clarify what stops the applicable time period from commencing, and identify if any equitable tolling doctrines might extend the time period during which the claim must be filed.</p>

<p id="65f0b6db-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-indent-flush">Paula is on the rooftop of her Colorado home installing Christmas lights on an early December morning. A low-flying military F-18 fighter jet flies overhead circling the mountain on which Paula’s home was built. Paula was amazed by the sight of the aircraft, though alarmed at how low it was flying. Rather than leaving her rooftop, however, she decided to stay where the view was good and take photographs of it with her smartphone. Finally it headed directly toward her home; Paula was giddy at the prospect of the image she might capture. However, as it passed overhead, the wind gust generated by the plane’s movement through the air literally knocked Paula off her feet, causing her to roll off the edge of the roof and suffer a serious neck fracture. Paula incurred extensive medical bills and it will take her years of therapy to regain the ability to walk. In the meantime, she complained to the Department of Defense within a month of the accident about the low flight of the aircraft. The government official, in response to Paula’s complaints, erroneously advised her that the aircraft was never lower than 300 feet—well above the 200-foot ceiling for aircraft practicing combat maneuvers over residential areas dictated by Department of Defense regulations. Three years pass since the accident. Out of desperation to pay her continuing medical bills, she finally consults a lawyer. The lawyer obtains the actual flight records for that F-18’s operations on the day of the incident (through a Freedom of Information Act request) and learns that the aircraft was recorded flying as low as 150 feet and that his commander had authorized the low flight as “good training.” Assume that there is a governing statute that states, “Any claims for personal injuries caused by aircraft must be brought within two years of the date of the flight.”</p>

Nine courts adopted pure comparative fault. In two of these states, legislatures subsequently enacted a modified form. Two courts adopted a modified form of comparative fault. <i>See Bradley v. Appalachian Power Co.</i>, 163 W. Va. 332, 256 S.E.2d 879 (1979) (plaintiff may recover if his negligence is less than defendants’); <i>Nelson v.

At trial plaintiff contended that the release was invalid, asserting that a release does not bind the releasor if at the time of its execution he suffered from so weak a mental condition that he was unable to comprehend the effect of his act. The jury, however, found against plaintiff on this issue. Since the verdict of the jury established that plaintiff either knew or should have known the significance of the release, this appeal raises the sole question of whether the release can stand as a matter of law.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="65eac37e-4ca1-11e8-b97c-cd7dc85dbd6b"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10742_a395957c-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d" id="note-N10742_a395957c-342a-11e8-be72-59d377edbd9d">6</a></span>&nbsp;The view that the exculpatory contract is valid only if the public interest is not involved represents the majority holding in the United States.

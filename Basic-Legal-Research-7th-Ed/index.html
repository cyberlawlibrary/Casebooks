<p id="9cdbd514-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The seventh edition of <i>Basic Legal Research: Tools and Strategies</i> is fully updated and contains the following new material:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="9cdbfc25-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Updated sample pages and screen shots</b>—The annotated examples, screen shots, and sample pages have all been updated.</p></li>
<li><p id="9cdbfc26-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Updated coverage of online sources</b>—The text covers the latest releases of Lexis Advance, Westlaw, and Bloomberg Law, including Bloomberg Law’s natural language searching, BCite citator, and Points of Law function. It also discusses other services such as Fastcase, Casetext, and govinfo.gov (the successor to the Federal Digital System as the official digital repository of federal documents).</p></li>
<li><p id="9cdc2337-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Updated coverage of citation</b>—The text has been updated to cover both the ALWD Guide to Legal Citation (6th ed.) and the Bluebook (20th ed.).</p></li>
<li><p id="9cdc2338-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Coverage that reflects both teaching needs and actual practice</b>— Several chapters have been reorganized to better align the text’s coverage with the holdings in most law libraries. Many libraries have significantly reduced their print collections, making online sources the predominant focus of instruction. Chapter 4 (Secondary Source Research), Chapter 5 (Case Research), and Chapter 7 (Statutory Research) have been revised so that professors can skip print materials in classes that emphasize online research. For those who teach print research, the text retains thorough print coverage to give students a strong foundation in print research, as well as the information about print material necessary to understand legal citations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="9cdc2339-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The philosophy and the format of the seventh edition remain the same as those of earlier editions. The genesis of this book was a conversation I had with Todd Petit, a student in my Lawyering Skills class at Catholic University, in the fall of 1994. Todd was working on a research project, and he came to me in frustration and bewilderment over the research process. Over the course of the year, Todd ultimately mastered the skill of legal research. Nevertheless, our conversation that fall caused <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="xvi" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-xvi">p. xvi</span>me to start thinking about how I could teach research more effectively, a process that ultimately culminated in this book.</p>
<p id="9cdc4a4a-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I do not believe Todd’s experience was unique. Mastering a skill is a form of experiential learning—learning that can be done only by doing. And the “doing” aspect necessarily involves periods of trial and error until a person grasps the skill. It is not surprising that this can be frustrating and even bewildering at times.</p>
<p id="9cdc4a4b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having said that, however, even experiential learning has to be built on a base of information. My goal with this book is to provide two kinds of information necessary for students to learn the process of legal research: basic information about a range of research sources and a framework for approaching research projects.</p>
<p id="9cdc4a4c-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This text provides instruction for using a variety of legal research sources, including secondary sources, cases and digests, citators, statutes, federal legislative history, and federal administrative regulations. Each of these sources is described in a separate chapter that includes the following components:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="9cdc4a4d-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">introductory information about the source</p></li>
<li><p id="9cdc715e-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">step-by-step instructions for print research</p></li>
<li><p id="9cdc715f-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">an explanation of online research tools available for the source</p></li>
<li><p id="9cdc7160-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">an explanation of citation rules for the source</p></li>
<li><p id="9cdc7161-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">an annotated set of sample pages and screen shots illustrating the research process for the source</p></li>
<li><p id="9cdc7162-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">a checklist summarizing both the research process and the key features of the source.</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="9cdc9873-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The range of material in each of these chapters is intended to accommodate a variety of teaching and learning styles. These chapters contain textual explanations, charts, and checklists that can be used for in-class discussions and for out-of-class reference as students are conducting research. In addition, the sample pages and screen shots illustrating the research process provide both instructional material and a useful summary synthesizing the information on the source from the rest of the chapter.</p>
<p id="9cdc9874-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This text does more, however, than simply explain the bibliographic features of various research sources. It also provides instruction in research as a process, and it does this in two ways. First, Chapters 1–3 provide an overview of research sources and the research process. These chapters provide a framework for understanding the relationships among different types of legal authority, a method for generating and prioritizing search terms, and an overview of different approaches to searching. Through this material, these chapters set the stage for a process-oriented introduction to research instruction. Second, Chapter 11 provides a framework for creating a research plan. By setting out a process based on a series of questions students can ask to define the contours of any type <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="xvii" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-xvii">p. xvii</span>of research project, it provides a flexible approach that can be adapted to a variety of assignments. Although Chapter 11 is the last chapter in the text, it can be used whenever students are required to develop a strategy for approaching a research project.</p>
<p id="9cdc9875-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most legal research is now accomplished online. The coverage of online research within each chapter devoted to an individual research source covers online search techniques specifically suited to that source. General techniques for conducting online research, however, appear in a separate chapter, Chapter 10. This chapter can be used in conjunction with other chapters at any point in the research course.</p>
<p id="9cdcbf86-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, the text provides instruction in a wide range of online research sources. It discusses research using commercial services such as Westlaw, Lexis Advance, and Bloomberg Law. But it also covers a range of other online research options, including subscription services and publicly available websites. As part of this instruction, the text discusses cost considerations so that students can learn to make informed decisions about when to use online sources and how to select the best online source for any research project.</p>
<p id="9cdcbf87-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This text seeks to provide students with not only the bibliographic skills to locate the legal authorities necessary to resolve a research issue, but also an understanding of research process that is an integral component of students’ training in problem-solving skills. I hope this text will prove to be a useful guide to students as they undertake this intellectual challenge.</p>

<p id="9ce80a72-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What is legal research and why do you need to learn about it? Researching the law means finding the rules that govern conduct in our society. To be a successful lawyer, you need to know how to research the law. Lawyers are often called upon to solve problems and give advice, and to do that accurately, you must know the rules applicable to the different situations you and your clients will face. Clients may come to you after an event has occurred and ask you to pursue a remedy for a bad outcome, or perhaps defend them against charges that they have acted wrongfully. You may be asked to help a client accomplish a goal like starting a business or buying a piece of property. In these situations and many others, you will need to know your clients’ rights and responsibilities, as defined by legal rules. Consequently, being proficient in legal research is essential to your success in legal practice.</p>
<p id="9ce80a73-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a starting point for learning about how to research the law, it is important to understand some of the different sources of legal rules. This chapter discusses what these sources are and where they originate within our legal system. It also provides an introduction to the process of legal research, an overview of some of the research tools you will learn to use, and an introduction to legal citation. Later chapters explain how to locate legal rules using a variety of resources.</p>

<p id="9ce83188-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are four main sources of law, which exist at both state and federal levels:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="9ce83189-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">constitutions;</p></li>
<li><p id="9ce8589a-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">statutes;</p></li>
<li><p id="9ce8589b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">court opinions (also called cases);</p></li>
<li><p id="9ce8589c-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">administrative regulations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="9ce8589d-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A constitution establishes a system of government and defines the boundaries of authority granted to the government. The United States Constitution is the preeminent source of law in our legal system, and all other rules, whether promulgated by a state or the federal government, must comply with its requirements. Each state also has its own constitution. A state’s constitution may grant greater rights than those secured by the federal constitution, but because a state constitution is subordinate to the federal constitution, it cannot provide lesser rights than the federal constitution does. All of a state’s legal rules must comport with both the state and federal constitutions.</p>
<p id="9ce87fae-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since grade school, you have been taught that the U.S. Constitution created three branches of government: the legislative branch, which makes the laws; the judicial branch, which interprets the laws; and the executive branch, which enforces the laws. State governments are also divided into these three branches. Although this is elementary civics, this structure truly does define the way government authority is divided in our system of government.</p>
<p id="9ce87faf-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The legislative branch of government creates statutes, which must be approved by the executive branch (the president, for federal statutes; the governor, for state statutes) to go into effect. The executive branch also makes rules. Administrative agencies, such as the federal Food and Drug Administration or a state’s department of motor vehicles, are part of the executive branch. They execute the laws passed by the legislature and create their own regulations to carry out the mandates established by statute.</p>
<p id="9ce87fb0-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judicial branch is the source of court opinions. Courts interpret rules created by the legislative and executive branches of government. If a court determines that a rule does not meet constitutional requirements, it can invalidate the rule. Otherwise, however, the court must apply the rule to the case before it. Court opinions can also be an independent source of legal rules. Legal rules made by courts are called “commonlaw” rules. Although courts are empowered to make these rules, legislatures can adopt legislation that changes or abolishes a common-law rule, as long as the legislation is constitutional.</p>

<p id="9ce87fb2-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An example may be useful to illustrate the relationships among the rules created by the three branches of the federal government. As you know, the U.S. Constitution, through the First Amendment, guarantees the right to free expression. Congress could pass legislation requiring television stations to provide educational programming for children. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is the administrative agency within the executive branch that would have responsibility for carrying out Congress’s will. If the statute were not specific about what constitutes educational programming or how much educational programming must be provided, the FCC would have to create administrative regulations to execute the law. The regulations would provide the information not detailed in the statute, such as the definition of educational programming. A television station could challenge the statute and regulations by arguing to a court that prescribing the content of material the station must broadcast violates the First Amendment. The court would then have to interpret the statute and regulations to decide whether they comport with the Constitution.</p>
<p id="9ce8a5c3-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another example illustrates the relationship between courts and legislatures in the area of common-law rules. The rules of negligence have largely been created by the courts. Therefore, liability for negligence is usually determined by common-law rules. A state’s highest court could decide that a plaintiff who sues a defendant for negligence cannot recover any damages if the plaintiff herself was negligent and contributed to her</p>

This decision would create a common-law rule governing future cases of negligence within that state. The state legislature could step in and pass a statute that changes the rule. For example, the legislature could enact a statute providing that juries are to determine the percentage of negligence attributable to each party and to apportion damages accordingly, instead of completely denying recovery to the plaintiff. Courts in that state would then be obligated to apply the rule from the statute, not the former common-law rule.</p>
<p id="9ce91b01-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although these examples are simplified, they demonstrate the basic roles of each of the branches of government in enunciating the legal rules governing the conduct of society. They also demonstrate that researching a legal issue may require you to research several different types of legal authority. The answer to a research question may not be found exclusively in statutes or court opinions or administrative regulations. Often, these sources must be researched together to determine all the rules applicable to a research issue.</p>

<p id="9ce94216-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One term used to describe the rules that govern conduct in society is “authority.” “Authority,” however, is a broad term that can describe both legal rules that must be followed and other types of information that are not legal rules. To understand the weight, or authoritative value, an authority carries, you must learn to differentiate “primary” authority from “secondary” authority and “binding” authority from “nonbinding” authority.</p>
<p id="9ce94217-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Primary authority is a term used to describe a source of a rule of law. All of the sources of rules discussed so far in this chapter are primary authorities. Constitutional provisions, statutes, cases, and administrative regulations contain legal rules, and as a consequence, are primary authorities. Because “the law” consists of legal rules, primary authority is sometimes described as “the law.”</p>
<p id="9ce94218-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Secondary authority, by contrast, refers to commentary on the law or analysis of the law, but not “the law” itself. An opinion from the U.S. Supreme Court is a primary authority, but an article written by a private party explaining and analyzing the opinion is a secondary authority. Secondary authorities are often quite useful in legal research because their analysis can help you understand complex legal issues and refer you to primary authorities. Nevertheless, a secondary authority is not “the law” and therefore is distinguished from a primary authority.</p>
<p id="9ce94219-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Binding and nonbinding authority are terms courts use to categorize the different sources of law they use in making their decisions. Binding authority, which can also be called mandatory authority, refers to an authority that the court is obligated to follow. A binding authority <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="5" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-5">p. 5</span>contains one or more rules that you must apply to determine the correct answer to your research question. Nonbinding authority, which can also be called persuasive authority, refers to an authority that the court may follow if it is persuaded to do so, but is not required to follow. A nonbinding authority, therefore, will not dictate the answer to your research question, although it may help you figure out the answer. Whether an authority is binding or nonbinding depends on several factors, as discussed in the next section.</p>

<p id="9ce9692c-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The degree to which an authority controls the answer to a legal question is called the weight of the authority. Not all authorities have the same weight. The weight of an authority depends on its status as primary or secondary, as well as its status as binding or nonbinding.</p>
<p id="9ce9692d-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An authority’s status as a primary or secondary authority is fixed. An authority is either part of “the law,” or it is not. Anything that does not fit into one of the categories of primary authority is secondary authority. Distinguishing primary authority from secondary authority is the first step in determining how much weight a particular authority has in the resolution of your research question. Then you can determine whether the authority is binding or nonbinding.</p>
<p id="9ce9692e-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>(1) Secondary authority: always nonbinding</i></b></p>
<p id="9ce9692f-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once you identify an authority as secondary, you can be certain that it will not control the outcome of the question you are researching because all secondary authorities are nonbinding. Nevertheless, some are more persuasive than others. Some are so respected that a court, while not technically bound by them, would need a good reason to depart from or reject their statements of legal rules. Others do not enjoy the same degree of respect, leaving a court free to ignore or reject such authorities if it is not persuaded to follow them. Further discussion of the persuasive value of various secondary authorities appears in Chapter 4. The important thing to remember for now is that secondary authorities are always categorized as persuasive or nonbinding.</p>
<p id="9ce96930-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>(2) Primary authority: sometimes binding, sometimes nonbinding</i></b></p>
<p id="9ce99041-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sometimes a primary authority is a binding, or mandatory, authority, and sometimes it is not. You must be able to evaluate the authority to determine whether it is binding on the question you are researching.</p>
<p id="9ce99042-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One factor affecting whether a primary authority is binding is jurisdiction. A rule contained in a primary authority applies only to conduct occurring within the jurisdiction in which the authority is in force. For example, all laws in the United States must comport with the federal Constitution because it is a primary authority that is binding, or mandatory, in all United States jurisdictions. The New Jersey constitution is <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="6" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-6">p. 6</span>also a primary authority because it contains legal rules establishing the scope of state government authority, but it is binding authority only in New Jersey. The New Jersey constitution’s rules do not apply in Illinois or Michigan.</p>
<p id="9ce99043-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Determining the weight of a case is a little more complex. All cases are primary authorities. Whether a particular case is binding or nonbinding is a function not only of jurisdiction, but also level of court. To understand how these factors work together, it is easiest to consider level of court first and jurisdiction second.</p>
<p id="9ce99044-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>(i)<i> Determining the weight of a case: level of court</i></b></p>
<p id="9ce99045-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judicial branches of government in all states and in the federal system have multiple levels of courts. Trial courts are at the bottom of the judicial hierarchy. In the federal system, the United States District Courts are trial-level courts, and each state has at least one federal district court. Intermediate appellate courts hear appeals of trial court cases. Most, but not all, states have intermediate appellate courts. In the federal system, the intermediate appellate courts are called United States Courts of Appeals, and they are divided into 13 separate circuits: 11 numbered circuits (First through Eleventh), the District of Columbia Circuit, and the Federal Circuit. The highest court or court of last resort is often called the supreme court. It hears appeals of cases from the intermediate appellate courts or directly from trial courts in states that do not have intermediate appellate courts. In the federal system, of course, the court of last resort is the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p id="9ce99046-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Trial court opinions, including those from federal district courts, bind the parties to the cases but do not bind other trial courts considering similar cases, nor do they bind courts above them in the court structure. They are usually nonbinding, or persuasive, authority.</p>
<p id="9ce99047-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The opinions of intermediate appellate courts bind the courts below them. In other words, intermediate appellate cases are binding authorities for the trial courts subordinate to them in the court structure. The weight of intermediate appellate cases on the intermediate appellate courts themselves varies. In jurisdictions with multiple appellate divisions, the opinions of one division may or may not be binding on other divisions. In addition, in some circumstances, intermediate appellate courts can overrule their own prior opinions. Intermediate appellate cases are nonbinding authorities for the court of last resort.</p>
<p id="9ce9b758-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court of last resort may, but is not required to, follow the opinions of the courts below it. Its opinions, however, are binding authorities for both intermediate appellate courts and trial courts subordinate to the court of last resort in the court structure. The court of last resort is not bound by its own prior opinions but will be reluctant to change an earlier ruling without a compelling justification.</p>

<p id="9ce9de6f-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second factor affecting the weight of court opinions is jurisdiction. As with other forms of primary authority, rules stated in court opinions are binding authority only within the court’s jurisdiction. An opinion from the Texas Supreme Court is binding only on a court applying Texas law. A California court deciding a question of California law would consider the Texas opinion nonbinding authority. If the California court had to decide a new issue not previously addressed by binding California authority (a “question of first impression”), it might choose to follow the Texas Supreme Court’s opinion if it found the opinion persuasive.</p>
<p id="9ce9de70-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On questions of federal law, opinions of the U.S. Supreme Court are binding authority for all other courts because it has nationwide jurisdiction. An opinion from a circuit court of appeals is binding only within the circuit that issued the opinion and is nonbinding everywhere else. Thus, a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit would be binding within the Eleventh Circuit, but not within the Seventh Circuit. <b>Figure 1.3</b> shows the geographic boundaries of the federal circuit courts of appeals.</p>

On questions of state law, each state’s courts get the last word, and on questions of federal law, the federal courts get the last word. For an issue governed by state law, the opinions of the courts within the relevant state are mandatory authority. For an issue governed by federal law, the opinions of the relevant federal courts are binding authority.</p>
<p id="9cea2ca4-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ordinarily, understanding how jurisdiction affects the weight of authority is fairly intuitive. When a Massachusetts trial court resolves a case arising out of conduct that took place in Massachusetts, it will treat the opinions of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court as binding authority. Sometimes, however, a court has to resolve a case governed by the law of another jurisdiction. State courts sometimes decide cases governed by the law of another state or by federal law. Federal courts sometimes decide cases governed by state law. When that happens, the court deciding the case will treat the law of the controlling jurisdiction as binding authority.</p>
<p id="9cea2ca5-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, assume that the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, a federal trial court, has to decide a case concerning breach of a contract to build a house in El Paso, Texas. Contract law is, for the most part, established by the states. To resolve this case, the federal court will apply the contract law of the state where the dispute arose, in this case, Texas. The Texas Supreme Court’s opinions on contract law are binding authority for resolving the case. Now assume that the same court has to decide a case concerning immigration law. Immigration law is established by the federal government. To resolve the case, the court will apply federal law. The opinions of the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit are binding authority for resolving the case.</p>

You have a key in your hand, but you have no idea which car it starts. The key is not much use to you unless you have some way of figuring out which car it starts. The more information you can gather about the car, the easier the car will be to find. Knowing the make, model, or color would narrow the options.

You have to know the features of the research tools available to you to conduct research, just as you must have the key to start the car. But that is not enough to make you an effective researcher. Effective legal research combines mastery of the mechanics of research with legal problem-solving skills. The research process is part of the reasoning process. It is not a rote task you complete before you begin to evaluate an issue. Rather, it is an analytical task in which you narrow the field of all legal information available to the subset of information necessary to assess an issue. As you locate and evaluate information, you <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="11" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-11">p. 11</span>will learn about the issue you are researching, and that knowledge will help you determine both whether you have located useful information and what else you should be looking for to complete your understanding of the issue.</p>
<p id="9ceac8fa-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To understand the process of research, you must first understand how legal information is organized. Most, if not all, of the authorities you will learn to research are available from a variety of sources. They may be published in print, online, or in both formats. Online research services that provide access to legal publications include commercial databases that charge a fee for access and websites freely available to anyone. Of course, you can obtain legal information from a general search engine like Google or a general source of information like Wikipedia, but lawyers often conduct legal research with more specialized tools.</p>
<p id="9ceaf00b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most legal information is organized by type of authority and jurisdiction. In print, this means individual types of authority from individual jurisdictions are published in separate sets of books. Court opinions from Maryland will be in one set of books (called “reporters”), and those from Massachusetts will be in another set of reporters. The same holds true for print collections of statutes and other types of legal authority.</p>
<p id="9ceaf00c-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Online research tools are organized similarly. Some are like print sets of books in that they provide access to one type of authority from one jurisdiction. The website for the Arizona Supreme Court, for example, contains only Arizona Supreme Court opinions. Others provide access to multiple types of authority from many different jurisdictions. Although these services aggregate a wide range of legal authority, they generally subdivide their contents much like print sources into individual databases organized by jurisdiction and type of authority. There are many commercial and government sources that provide online access to legal authority.</p>
<p id="9ceaf00d-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Westlaw and Lexis Advance are the best known online legal research services. Bloomberg Law is another online provider. All three are commercial databases that allow you to access all of the types of legal authority discussed in this chapter. They charge subscribers for use of their services, although your law school undoubtedly subsidizes the cost of student research while you are in school. Other commercial and free research services you may encounter in law school include Fastcase, Casemaker, Findlaw, and Cornell Law School’s Legal Information Institute, among others. They provide access to many of the same types of authorities you can find in Lexis Advance and Westlaw. You will also learn about federal, state, and local government websites you can use for legal research.</p>
<p id="9ceaf00e-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The organization of legal information by jurisdiction and type of authority affects the way individual legal authorities are identified. All <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="12" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-12">p. 12</span>legal authorities have citations assigned to them. The citation is the identifying information you can use to retrieve a document from a book or database. Thus, if you have the citation to an authority, you can locate it using that identifying information. To return to the key analogy, this is like knowing the state and license plate number of the car you are trying to locate in the parking lot.</p>
<p id="9ceaf00f-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Citations were originally formulated so that researchers could find authorities in print. Although most authorities are now available online, they are still primarily identified by their print citations. In print research, the citation generally includes the name of the book in which the source is published, the volume of the book containing the specific item, and the page or section number where the item begins. For example, each court opinion is identified by a citation containing the volume number of the reporter in which it is published, the name of the reporter, and the starting page of the opinion. If you had the citation for a case, you could go to the library or get online and locate it easily. Statutes, secondary sources, and other forms of authority also have citations you can use to retrieve specific documents.</p>
<p id="9ceaf010-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, with most research projects, you will not know the citations to the authorities you need to find. You will have been assigned the project to find out which legal authorities, if any, pertain to the subject of your research issue. Moreover, although occasionally you will need to locate only one specific item, such as a specific case, more often you will need to collect a range of authorities that pertain to the issue, such as a statute and cases that have interpreted the statute. Therefore, you will need to narrow the field of all legal information to that subset of information necessary to analyze your research issue.</p>
<p id="9ceaf011-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You will generally narrow the field of information using two types of criteria: general document characteristics and specific content. General document characteristics include the jurisdiction and type of authority (e.g., cases, statutes, secondary sources). By narrowing the field of information to documents with particular characteristics, you can identify binding authority relevant to your research issue. Focusing on documents that contain specific content is another way to narrow the field to information relevant to your research question. Although you will usually use both types of criteria in conducting research, the order in which you use them affects your research process.</p>
<p id="9ceb1722-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With some research tools, you must determine jurisdiction and type of authority before you begin to look for content related to your research issue because the information available is organized into separate books or databases according to jurisdiction and type of authority. In other words, you filter the available information by source first and then identify relevant content within each source. When you filter first by source, you use a source-driven approach to research.</p>

<p id="9ceb654f-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With some online services, including Westlaw, Lexis Advance, and Bloomberg Law, you can, but do not have to, filter by jurisdiction or type of authority before you execute a search. You have the option of searching for content related to your research issue first and then filtering the results by jurisdiction, type of authority, or both. When you filter first by content, you use a content-driven approach to research.</p>
<p id="9ceb6550-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With either approach, once you locate information, you must evaluate the results of your research to determine whether the information you have found is useful. The source-driven and content-driven approaches are illustrated in <b>Figure 1.5</b>.</p>
<p id="9ceb6551-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One question you may have is whether it is better to use a sourceor content-driven approach. The answer depends on the nature of your research project and your level of expertise about the subject matter. With a source-driven approach, you have to think carefully about a research issue to figure out which type(s) of authority are most likely to contain relevant information. Although selecting a type of authority can be challenging, choosing specific types of authority to research can make it easier to analyze the results because they are confined to the particular type of authority you selected. In addition, a savvy researcher may know exactly what type of authority governs—such as a state statute— and may not want to bother filtering through other types of authority included in the results. Conversely, if you are not sure which type(s) of authority to use, you may miss some relevant material altogether if it is in a source you did not consider using.</p>
<p id="9ceb6552-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="14" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-14">p. 14</span>Because the content-driven approach allows you to search without first selecting a source, it shifts much of the analytical work involved in research to filtering the search results. This can be an advantage because the search results can include sources you might not have considered using. On the other hand, this approach frequently retrieves a large amount of information that has to be sifted carefully. Retrieving hundreds or thousands of documents can feel overwhelming if you do not understand your research issue well enough to filter the results effectively. Chapter 3 explains source-driven and content-driven searching in greater detail to help you learn how to determine which approach is better for your research project.</p>

<p id="9ceb8c65-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The chapters that follow explain how to use a range of research tools to locate various types of legal authority. As noted above, however, knowing the mechanics of the research tools available to you is only part of learning to be an effective researcher. To research effectively, you must incorporate your technical knowledge into a research plan so that you can find the information you need to analyze your research issue. To do this, you will want to proceed in an organized manner to make sure your research is accurate and complete. Chapter 11, Developing a Research Plan, explores research planning in depth. This introduction to the planning process will help provide context as you learn the features of various research tools.</p>
<p id="9ceb8c66-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When you have a research task to complete, you will ordinarily proceed as follows:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="9ceb8c67-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Define the scope of your research project and the issue(s) you need to research.</p></li>
<li><p id="9ceb8c68-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Generate a list of search terms specific to your research issue(s).</p></li>

</ul>
<p id="9cebb37d-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is always a good idea to define the scope of your project before searching for information. Think about what you are being asked to do. Are you being asked to spend three weeks locating all information from every jurisdiction on a particular subject, or do you have a day to find <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="15" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-15">p. 15</span>out how courts in one state have ruled on an issue? Will you write an extensive analysis of your research, or will you summarize the results orally to the person who made the assignment? Evaluating the type of work product you are expected to produce, the amount of time you have, and the scope of the project will help you determine the best way to proceed.</p>
<p id="9cebb37e-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You should also think carefully about the issue(s) you are being asked to research. Sometimes you will be asked to research a specific issue. Sometimes you will be presented with a research scenario and asked to determine the issue(s) it presents. It sounds almost silly to say this, but knowing what you are looking for will make it easier to find what you need.</p>
<p id="9cebb37f-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once you have defined your research task, you will need to generate search terms to use to search for information. Chapter 2 discusses different ways to do this. In general, however, you will need to construct a list of words or concepts to use to search for relevant content.</p>
<p id="9cebb380-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You will then want to plan your research path. The more you know about your research issue going in, the easier it will be to plan your research process. The less you know, the more flexible you will need to be in your approach. One of the goals of this text is to help you learn to plan your research path and assess the appropriate starting, middle, and ending points for your research.</p>
<p id="9cebb381-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Your ultimate goal in most research projects will be to locate binding primary authority, if it exists, on your research issue. Thus, regardless of whether you use a sourceor content-driven approach, at some point you must consider type of authority and jurisdiction because these two factors determine whether the information you have located is binding primary authority. If binding primary authority is not available or does not directly answer your research question, nonbinding authority (either primary or secondary) may help you analyze the issue. Therefore, in planning your research path, it may be helpful for you to think about three categories of authority: binding primary authority, nonbinding primary authority, and secondary authority.</p>
<p id="9cebb382-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because your goal will usually be to locate binding primary authority, you might think that that should be the starting point for all your research. In fact, if you know a lot about the issue you are researching, you might begin with binding primary authority, but that is not always the case. Secondary authorities that cite, analyze, and explain the law can provide a very efficient way to obtain background information and references to primary authority. Although secondary authorities are not controlling in your analysis, they are invaluable research tools and can be a good starting point for your project. Nonbinding primary authority will rarely provide a good starting place because it provides neither the controlling rules nor analysis explaining the law. <b>Figure 1.6</b> shows the relationships among these three categories of authority.</p>

<p id="9cec28bc-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many research sources contain notes that refer to other sources, so once you locate one relevant source, you may be able to use the research notes to find additional useful information. Thus, there may be more than one appropriate starting point for your research. This text explains the features of a wide range of research sources so you can learn to make this assessment for different types of research projects.</p>
<p id="9cec28bd-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once you have planned your research path, you will execute your plan to search for information. As you locate information, you will need to evaluate its relevance to your research issue. One important aspect of assessing the information you find is making sure it is up to date. The law can change at any time. New cases are decided; older cases may be over-<div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="17" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-17">p. 17</span>ruled; statutes can be enacted, amended, or repealed. Therefore, keeping your research current is essential. One way to update your research is with a specialized research tool called a citator, which is explained in Chapter 6. In addition, most sources of legal information will indicate how recently they have been updated to help you assess whether the information is current.</p>
<p id="9cec28be-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most print research sources consist of hardcover books that can be difficult to update when the law changes. Some print resources are published in chronological order. For those resources, new books are published periodically as new material is compiled. Many, however, are organized by subject. For those resources, publishers cannot print new books every time the law changes. This would be prohibitively expensive, and because the law can change at any time, the new books would likely be out of date as soon as they were printed. To keep the books current, therefore, many print sources are updated with softcover pamphlets containing new information that becomes available after the hardcover book is published. These supplementary pamphlets are often called “pocket parts” because many of them fit into a “pocket” in the inside back cover of the hardcover book. The hardcover book and the pocket part will each indicate the period of time it covers. You will see pocket parts mentioned throughout this text in reference to print research tools.</p>
<p id="9cec28bf-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Online sources also usually contain publication or revision date information that you can use to assess how current it is. Online sources can be updated easily in the sense that new information can be added and older information revised at any time and as frequently as necessary. Westlaw, Lexis Advance, and Bloomberg Law update at least some of their content on a daily basis. Providers other than major commercial vendors may not update their content as frequently. In addition, updates for some content may only become available when the print version of the source is updated, which means the online version may only be as current as the latest print version. No matter how you locate information, you must pay careful attention to the date of any information you find.</p>
<p id="9cec28c0-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because research is not a linear process, you may find that you have to revise your search terms or your research plan to complete your work. If you do not find any information, or find too much information, you may need to backtrack or rethink your approach. Even if you find relevant information from the start, what you learn when you assess that information may take you in new directions. The process of searching, reading, and assessing will continue until you have narrowed the field of all legal information to the subset of information necessary to evaluate your research issue. This text explains a variety of search strategies you can use to tailor your research process to the specific issue you are researching.</p>

Rules for formatting legal citations appear in <i>The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation</i> (20th ed. 2015) and the <i>ALWD Guide to Legal Citation</i> (6th ed. 2017). Citation formats are the same using either source. Any minor differences are typically addressed in online updates to maintain consistency between both manuals. You should use whichever citation manual your professor directs you to use.</p>
<p id="9cec4fd4-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This section provides a brief overview of the organization of both citation manuals and will make the most sense if you have your citation manual in front of you as you read.

The online version offers search options unavailable in the print version. Additionally, it allows you to bookmark commonly used rules and add your own annotations to the rules, tasks you would otherwise need to do manually with a print <i>Bluebook.</i> The online version also requires an annual subscription fee, whereas a print <i>Bluebook</i> requires only a single purchase. Most of the discussion in this section applies equally to the print and online versions of the <i>Bluebook,</i> but a few variations are noted.</p>
<p id="9cec4fd7-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first part of the <i>Bluebook</i> that you should review is the Introduction. This section explains how the <i>Bluebook</i> is organized. As you will see when you review the Introduction, the <i>Bluebook</i> contains two sets of instructions for citing authority: “basic” citation rules used in legal practice and more complex rules used for citations in scholarly publications such as law journals, a type of secondary source discussed in more detail in Chapter 4. The “basic” citation rules apply to the types of documents most students write in their first year of law school, such as briefs, memoranda, and other documents used in legal practice. The remainder of the citation rules apply primarily to law journals, although some aspects of these rules also apply to practice documents. You are unlikely to write documents in law journal format at the beginning of your legal studies; therefore, you will want to focus your attention on the format for citations in briefs, memoranda, and other similar legal documents.</p>

<p id="9cec9e00-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>■ THE TEXT OF THE CITATION RULES</b></p>
<p id="9cec9e01-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most of the <i>Bluebook</i> is devoted to explaining the rules for citing different types of authority. In print, the Rules section appears in the white pages in the middle of the <i>Bluebook.</i> Online, use the <b>Rules</b> link. These rules can be divided into five categories:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-decimal">
<li class=""><p id="9cec9e02-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rules 1 through 9 are general rules applicable to a citation to any type of authority. For example, Rule 5 discusses the proper format for quotations.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="9cec9e03-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rules 10 through 17 contain rules for citing various primary and secondary authorities published in print. For example, Rule 10 explains how to cite a court opinion, and Rule 12 explains how to cite a statute.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="9cec9e04-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 18 contains rules for citing authorities published online.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="9cecc515-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 19 contains rules for citing authorities published in services for researching law related to specific subject areas.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="9cecc516-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rules 20 and 21 contain rules for citing foreign and international materials.</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="9cecc517-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some of the material contained in the Rules section also appears in the Bluepages. If the information you need for the authority you are citing is contained in the Bluepages, you may not need to consult the individual rules in the Rules section. If you face a citation question not addressed in the Bluepages, however, you should consult the individual rules for more detailed guidance. Most of the rules for citing specific types of legal authority begin with a description of the elements necessary for a full citation. The remainder of the rule will explain each component in greater detail.</p>
<p id="9cecc518-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="20" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-20">p. 20</span>Most rules are accompanied by example citations showing the format for citing various authorities. These examples are not always in the same typeface required for a citation used in a memorandum or other practice document. The examples in the Rules section are in the typefaces required for law journals, which are not always used in other types of legal documents. Therefore, although the examples in the Rules section will be somewhat useful to you in understanding how to cite legal authority, you cannot rely on them exclusively. The instructions in Bluepages B2 explain the differences between typeface conventions for citations in law journals and other documents.</p>
<p id="9cecc519-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>■ THE TABLES</b></p>
<p id="9cecc51a-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In print, the Tables appear in the white pages with blue edges at the back of the <i>Bluebook.</i> Use the <b>Tables</b> link online. The citation rules in the Bluepages and Rules sections of the <i>Bluebook</i> explain the general requirements for different types of citations. Often they require that certain words be abbreviated. The Tables contain abbreviations necessary for proper citations. For example, Table T1 lists each jurisdiction in the United States, and under each jurisdiction, it shows the proper abbreviations for citations to that jurisdiction’s cases and statutes. Whenever you have a citation that includes an abbreviation, you will need to check the appropriate Table to find the precise abbreviation required for a proper citation. You should note, however, that the type styles of some of the abbreviations in the Tables are in law journal format and may need to be modified according to Bluepages B2 for the work you will produce in your first year of law school.</p>
<p id="9cecc51b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>■ THE FINDING TOOLS FOR LOCATING INDIVIDUAL RULES</b></p>
<p id="9cecec2c-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As noted above, the Bluepages should be your starting point for determining how to construct a citation in <i>Bluebook</i> format. If you cannot find what you need in the Bluepages, you can find individual citation rules in the Rules section using the Table of Contents or the Index. In print<i>,</i> the Index references in black type refer to the pages with relevant rules. Those in blue type refer to examples of citations. The online Index refers only to rule and table numbers, not page numbers.</p>
<p id="9cecec2d-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the print version, you can also refer to the Quick Reference examples of different types of citations on the inside front and back covers. The examples on the inside front cover are in the format for law review and journal footnotes and will be of little or no use to you in your first year of law school. The examples on the inside back cover are in the proper format for the types of documents you are likely to draft in your first year.</p>
<p id="9cecec2e-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The online version does not contain the Quick Reference examples. It has a Quick Style Guide with limited citation examples formatted for law review and journal footnotes. Although these examples may be of <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="21" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-21">p. 21</span>limited use to you in your first year, they are different from those in the print Quick Reference and are available to view without a subscription. Additionally, the search box at the top of the screen allows you to do a basic search of <i>Bluebook</i> content. You can, as noted above, bookmark frequently used rules and add annotations to the rules. With an Advanced Search, you can tailor a search more specifically to target rules, examples, and tables, as well as your bookmarked rules and annotations.</p>
<p id="9cecec2f-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>■ <i>BLUEBOOK</i> UPDATES</b></p>
<p id="9cecec30-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You will find updates to the <i>Bluebook</i> on the <i>Bluebook</i> website. Updates (as well as the online Table of Contents, Index, and Quick Style Guide) are available without a subscription, so you will want to look for updates whether you use the <i>Bluebook</i> in print or online. The URL for the <i>Bluebook’s</i> online resources appears in Appendix A at the end of this text.</p>
<p id="9ced1341-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All of the pieces of the <i>Bluebook</i> work together to help you determine the proper citation format for a legal authority:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-decimal">
<li class=""><p id="9ced1342-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Use the Bluepages to find citation instructions governing the authority you want to cite.</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="9ced1344-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Use the Tables to find abbreviations and other information necessary for a complete citation.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="9ced1345-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If necessary, convert the typefaces in the examples and Tables into the proper format for briefs and memoranda according to Bluepages B2.</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="9ced1346-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As you read the remaining chapters in this text, you will find more specific information about citing individual legal authorities. In general, however, you will be able to use the <i>Bluebook</i> to figure out how to cite almost any type of authority by following these four steps.</p>
<p id="9ced3a57-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. THE <i>ALWD GUIDE</i></b></p>
<p id="9ced3a58-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>ALWD Guide</i> is a print publication. Although it is available as a Kindle e-book, it is not published online through a dedicated website the way the <i>Bluebook</i> is. The first part of the <i>ALWD Guide</i> that you should review is Part 1, Introductory Material. This section explains what citations are and how to use them, how to use the <i>ALWD Guide,</i> how local citation rules can affect citation format, and how your word processing settings may affect citations. It explains the <i>ALWD Guide’s</i> organization, <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="22" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-22">p. 22</span>so it would be redundant to repeat all of that information here. Nevertheless, a few comments on the <i>ALWD Guide</i> may be useful as you begin learning about it.</p>
<p id="9ced3a59-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>ALWD Guide</i> is organized differently than the <i>Bluebook</i> in that the <i>ALWD Guide</i> incorporates information on citations for practice documents and scholarly publications together within each citation rule. The <i>Bluebook,</i> by contrast, largely separates rules for practice documents into the Bluepages, as explained above. When you are using the <i>ALWD Guide,</i> you do not need to refer to a separate set of rules for different types of documents.</p>
<p id="9ced3a5a-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As you will see when you review Part 1, learning to cite authority using the <i>ALWD Guide</i> requires you to become familiar with five items:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="9ced3a5b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">the finding tools for locating individual citation rules (Table of Contents and Index);</p></li>

<p id="9ced6170-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>■ THE TABLE OF CONTENTS AND INDEX</b></p>
<p id="9ced6171-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To locate individual citation rules, you can use the Table of Contents at the beginning of the <i>ALWD Guide</i> or the Index at the end. Unless otherwise indicated, the references in the Index are to rule numbers, not page numbers or specific examples.</p>
<p id="9ced8882-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>■ THE TEXT OF THE CITATION RULES</b></p>
<p id="9ced8883-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most of the <i>ALWD Guide</i> is devoted to explaining the rules for citing different types of authority. The rules are divided into the following Parts:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-decimal">
<li class=""><p id="9ced8884-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Part 2 (Rules 1 through 11) contains general rules applicable to a citation to any type of authority. For example, Rule 3 discusses spelling and capitalization.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="9ced8885-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Part 3 (Rules 12 through 29) contains rules for citing various primary and secondary authorities. For example, Rule 12 explains how to cite a court opinion, and Rule 14 explains how to cite a statute.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="9ced8886-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Part 4 (Rules 30 through 33) contains rules for citing online sources.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="9ced8887-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Part 5 (Rules 34 through 37) contains rules for incorporating citations into documents.</p></li>

<p id="9cedaf99-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In each citation rule in Parts 3 and 4, you will find a description of the elements necessary for a full citation to an authority, followed by an annotated example showing how all of the elements fit together to <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="23" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-23">p. 23</span>create a complete citation. You should read this part of the rule first. The remainder of the rule will explain each component in greater detail.</p>
<p id="9cedaf9a-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Within the text of each rule in the <i>ALWD Guide,</i> you will find cross-references to other citation rules and to Appendices containing additional information that you may need for a complete citation. An explanation of the Appendices appears below.</p>
<p id="9cedaf9b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You will also find “Sidebars” in some rules. The “Sidebars” are literally asides on citation. They provide information about sources of legal authority, help you avoid common citation errors, and offer citation tips.</p>
<p id="9cedaf9c-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>■ THE APPENDICES</b></p>
<p id="9cedaf9d-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>ALWD Guide</i> contains seven Appendices that follow the Parts containing the citation rules. The citation rules in Parts 3 and 4 explain the general requirements for citations to different types of authority. Most of these rules require that certain words be abbreviated. Appendices 1, 3, 4, and 5 contain abbreviations necessary for proper citations. For example, Appendix 1 lists Primary Sources by Jurisdiction. It lists each jurisdiction in the United States, and under each jurisdiction, it shows the proper abbreviations for citations to that jurisdiction’s cases, statutes, and other primary authorities. Whenever you have a citation that includes an abbreviation, you will need to check the appropriate Appendix to find the precise abbreviation required for a proper citation.</p>
<p id="9cedaf9e-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appendix 2 contains references to local court citation rules. As noted above, some courts require special citation formats for authorities cited in documents filed with those courts. The <i>ALWD Guide</i> provides information on these local rules in Appendix 2.</p>
<p id="9cedaf9f-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appendix 6 contains information on citations to federal taxation materials, and Appendix 7 contains information on selected federal administrative publications.</p>
<p id="9cedafa0-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>■ THE “FAST FORMATS” AND “SNAPSHOTS”</b></p>
<p id="9cedd6b1-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before the text of each rule for citing an individual type of authority in Parts 3 and 4, you will find a section called “Fast Formats.” The “Fast Formats” provide citation examples for each rule, in addition to the examples interwoven with the text of the rule. A “Fast Formats Locator” appears on the inside front cover of the <i>ALWD Guide.</i> You can use this alphabetical list to find “Fast Formats” pages without going to the Table of Contents or Index.</p>
<p id="9cedd6b2-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Snapshots” also accompany the citation rules for some of the most commonly cited types of legal authority. “Snapshots” are annotated sample pages from sources of law that show you where to find the components of a full citation within the document.</p>

<p id="9cee24de-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because different research projects have different starting and ending points, it is not necessary for you to follow all of the chapters in this text in order. The sequence of assignments in your legal research class will determine the order in which you need to cover the material.</p>
<p id="9cee24df-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although you may not cover the chapters in order, a brief overview of the organization of this text may provide useful context for the material that follows. As noted earlier, Chapter 2 discusses how to generate search terms, one of the first steps in any research project, and Chapter 3 describes sourceand content-driven search strategies. Chapters 4 through 9 explain how to research different types of authority. Chapter 10 discusses online search techniques, and Chapter 11 covers how to create a research plan.</p>
<p id="9cee24e0-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chapters 4 through 9 are each organized in a similar way. They all begin with an overview of the type of authority discussed. Then you will find an explanation of the process of researching the authority. After the discussion of the research process, you will find information on citation format. The next item in each of these chapters is a section of sample pages. The sample pages contain step-by-step illustrations of the research process described earlier in the chapter. As you read through the text, you may find it helpful to review both the excerpts within the chapter and the sample pages section to get a sense of the research process for each type of authority. These chapters conclude with research checklists <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="25" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-25">p. 25</span>that summarize the research process and may be helpful as you conduct research.</p>
<p id="9cee24e1-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chapter 10 discusses general techniques for online research. The process of using print research sources varies according to the type of authority you are researching. With online research, however, there are certain common search techniques that can be used to research many types of authority. As a consequence, the discussion of online research in Chapters 4 through 9 focuses on search techniques specific to individual sources, and Chapter 10 focuses on more general online search techniques and strategies. As you learn about online research, you may also want to review Appendix A at the end of the text, which lists a number of research websites.</p>
<p id="9cee24e2-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The final chapter, Chapter 11, discusses research strategy and explains how to create a research plan. You do not need to read all of the preceding chapters before reading Chapter 11, although you may find Chapter 11 easier to follow after you have some background on a few research sources. Learning about research involves more than simply learning how to locate individual types of authority. You must also be able to plan a research strategy that will lead to accurate research results, and you must be able to execute your research strategy efficiently and economically. Chapter 11 sets out a process that will help you achieve these goals in any research project, whether in your legal research class or in legal practice.</p>

<p id="9cf26aa7-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When presented with a set of facts, you could generate a list of search terms by constructing a random list of words that seem relevant to the issue. But a more structured approach—working from a set of categories—will help ensure that you are covering all of your bases in conducting your research.</p>
<p id="9cf26aa8-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are a number of ways that you could categorize the information in your research issue to create a list of search terms. Some people prefer to use the six questions journalists ask when covering a story: who, what, when, where, why, and how. Another way to generate search terms is to categorize the information presented by the facts as follows.</p>
<p id="9cf26aa9-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">■ <b>THE <i>PARTIES</i> INVOLVED IN THE PROBLEM, DESCRIBED ACCORDING TO THEIR RELATIONSHIPS TO EACH OTHER</b></p>
<p id="9cf26aaa-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, you might be concerned not only with parties who are in direct conflict with each other, but also any other individuals, entities, or groups <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="28" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-28">p. 28</span>involved. These might include fact witnesses who can testify as to what happened, expert witnesses if appropriate to the situation, other potential plaintiffs (in civil cases), or other potential defendants (in criminal or civil cases).</p>
<p id="9cf26aab-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In describing the parties, proper names will not ordinarily be useful search terms, although if one party is a public entity or corporation, you might be able to locate other cases in which the entity or corporation was a party. Instead, you will usually want to describe the parties in terms of their legal status or relationships to each other, such as landlords and tenants, parents and children, employers and employees, or doctors and patients.</p>
<p id="9cf26aac-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">■ <b>THE <i>PLACES AND THINGS</i> INVOLVED IN THE PROBLEM</b></p>
<p id="9cf291bd-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In thinking about place, both geographical locale and type of location can be important. For example, the conduct at issue might have taken place in Pennsylvania, which would help you determine which jurisdiction’s law applies. It might also have taken place at a school or in an office, which could be important for determining which legal rules apply to the situation.</p>
<p id="9cf291be-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Things” can involve tangible objects or intangible concepts. In a problem involving a car accident, tangible things could include automobiles or stop signs. In other types of situations, intangible “things,” such as a vacation or someone’s reputation, could be useful search terms.</p>
<p id="9cf291bf-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">■ <b>THE <i>POTENTIAL CLAIMS AND DEFENSES</i> THAT COULD BE RAISED</b></p>
<p id="9cf291c0-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As you become more familiar with the law, you may be able to identify claims or defenses that a research problem potentially raises. The facts could indicate to you that the problem potentially involves particular claims (such as breach of contract, defamation, or bribery) or particular defenses (such as consent, assumption of the risk, or self-defense).</p>
<p id="9cf291c1-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lawyers use their accumulated knowledge, including both specialized knowledge gained in practice and foundational legal principles that all lawyers learn in law school, to identify legal doctrines that may apply to a client’s situation. Even as a beginning law student, you are being introduced to a body of information common to all lawyers that you can use to brainstorm potential legal theories. When that is the case, you can often use claims and defenses effectively as search terms to help you identify applicable rules of law.</p>
<p id="9cf291c2-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If you are dealing with an unfamiliar area of law, however, you might not know of any claims or defenses potentially at issue. In that situation, you can generate search terms by thinking about the conduct and mental states of the parties, as well as the injury suffered by the complaining party. Claims and defenses often flow from these considerations, and as a result, these types of terms can be used to locate useful information. When considering conduct, consider what was not done, as well as what was done. The failure to do an act might also give rise to a claim or defense.</p>
<p id="9cf291c3-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="29" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-29">p. 29</span>For example, you could be asked to research a situation in which one person published an article falsely asserting that another person was guilty of tax evasion, knowing that the accusation was not true. You might recognize this as a potential claim for the tort of defamation, which occurs when one person publishes false information that is damaging to another person’s reputation. Even if you were unfamiliar with this tort, however, you could still generate search terms relevant to the claim by considering the defendant’s conduct (publication) or mental state (intentional actions), or the plaintiff’s injury (to reputation). These search terms would likely lead you to authority on defamation.</p>

<p id="9cf2b8d7-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As an example of how you might go about using these categories to generate search terms, assume you have been asked to research the following situation:</p>

<p id="9cf2dff1-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once you have developed an initial set of search terms for your issue, the next task is to try to expand that list. The terms you originally generated may not appear in an index or a database. Therefore, once you have developed your initial set of search terms, you should try to increase both the breadth and the depth of the list. You can increase the breadth of the list by identifying synonyms and terms related to the initial search terms, and you can increase the depth by expressing the concepts in your search terms both more abstractly and more concretely.</p>
<p id="9cf2dff2-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Increasing the breadth of your list with synonyms and related terms is essential to your research strategy. This is especially true for word searches. As <b>Chapter 3</b> explains in more detail, some research tools can cross-reference content related to your search terms. A literal word search, however, searches only for the specific terms you identify. Therefore, to make sure you locate all of the pertinent information on your issue, you need to have a number of synonyms for the words and concepts in your search. In the research scenario described above, there are several synonyms and related terms for one of the initial search terms: ownership. As <b>Figure 2.1</b> illustrates, you might also search for terms such as title or possession.</p>

<p id="9cf32d1b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once you have generated and expanded a list of search terms, you must prioritize them. Recall the key analogy from Chapter 1: If you had the key to a car parked at Disney World, how would you figure out which car it starts? Three relevant criteria would be make, model, and color, and ideally you would narrow the field by all three together. If that were not possible, which criterion would you use first? When you generate an extensive list of search terms for legal research, you will often use some combination of terms together, but you usually will not use all of them simultaneously. You can only look up one term or concept at a time in a print index. You can combine terms together in a word search, but putting too many in one search may limit the search’s effectiveness. Consequently, you must decide where to focus your attention first.</p>
<p id="9cf32d1c-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You may find it helpful to think about two goals when you prioritize your search terms: identifying the legal rules that apply to your client’s situation, and determining how the facts of the situation fit with the requirements of the rules. Of course, this is a bit of a chicken-or-egg problem in that the facts of the situation determine which rules apply and the application of the rules depends on the facts of the situation. Nevertheless, one element of your search strategy will be deciding whether to prioritize terms describing legal doctrines or terms describing the specific facts of your client’s situation. This does not mean that you will ignore or discard other terms; it simply means that you must decide which terms to emphasize initially and which to use in fine-tuning the search results.</p>
<p id="9cf32d1d-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prioritizing terms relating to legal doctrines makes sense when you know the theory or theories most likely to apply to your client’s situation. To return to the key analogy, using the make and model to narrow the field of options would make sense. Prioritizing search terms related to the legal doctrine that applies to your research issue can similarly be an effective way to narrow the field of legal information.</p>
<p id="9cf32d1e-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As you begin learning about legal research, your professor may specify the legal doctrines you are to research. In the research scenario in Section A, above, regarding the dissolution of a long-term relationship, <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="32" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-32">p. 32</span>your professor might direct you to research whether the parties formed a common-law marriage. You would certainly prioritize “common-law marriage” as a search term based on your professor’s instructions.</p>
<p id="9cf32d1f-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In real life, clients bring the facts of their problems to you, not instructions to research particular legal theories, and as you become a more experienced researcher, your professor is less likely is to identify the legal doctrines or rules that apply to your research scenario. As you gain experience in the law, you will learn to identify the legal issues a situation presents and will be able to prioritize terms related to those issues in your research.</p>
<p id="9cf32d20-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sometimes, however, you will not begin your research with a sense of the applicable legal doctrines and will need to prioritize the facts of your client’s situation instead. You can then use the search results to determine the legal doctrines that govern situations involving those types of facts. To return to the key analogy again, prioritizing facts is like trying to find the parked car by searching by color. This will narrow the field, but the remaining choices will reflect substantial diversity of makes and models. Similarly, prioritizing terms relating to the specific facts of the client’s situation can lead to diffuse search results involving many different legal rules. The search results will also be affected by the level of abstraction of your terms. Search terms that are too concrete may yield little information, or little relevant information. More abstract factual terms may better steer you toward authority that describes applicable legal doctrines.</p>
<p id="9cf32d21-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the example involving dissolution of a client’s long-term relationship, prioritizing factual terms relating to the parties’ relationship could lead to rules about common-law marriage but would also likely lead to information about a variety of other legal doctrines. This is especially true for concrete terms like “boyfriend” or “girlfriend,” which can occur in virtually any legal context. Although prioritizing factual terms may not be a useful approach when you need to locate information about a particular legal doctrine (such as common-law marriage), it can be useful when you need to identify all possible avenues of recovery for a client or do not have a sense of the legal doctrines that may apply to the situation.</p>
<p id="9cf32d22-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Neither the list nor the priority of your search terms should remain static. Reading the information you find early in your research may reveal new search terms you can use to locate better information. The terminology of applicable legal rules that you did not consider at first might appear in the documents you locate in your initial research efforts, and they can then become useful terms for additional research (unless you have been instructed to limit your research to a particular legal doctrine). Facts that did not seem important at first could turn out to be critical to your analysis. As you work through your research path, therefore, you should revise both the content and priority of your search terms.</p>

<p id="9cf501e5-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recall the research scenario introduced in Chapter 2:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="9cf501e6-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Your client recently ended a long-term relationship with her partner. She and her partner never participated in a formal marriage ceremony, but they had always planned to get married “someday.” They lived together for five years and referred to each other as husband and wife. Your client and her former partner orally agreed to provide support for each other, and your client’s former partner repeatedly made statements like, “What’s mine is yours.” Your client wants to know if she is entitled to part of the value of the assets her former partner acquired during their relationship or to any support payments.</p>
</div>
<p id="9cf501e7-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Assume that your supervisor asked you to find out whether the parties’ relationship qualified as a common-law or “informal” marriage under the state’s family law statutes and to submit a summary of your research by the end of the day. How would you approach the task?</p>
<p id="9cf501e8-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Assume instead that your supervisor gave you a week to research the law and submit a memorandum analyzing any legal theories that might apply to your client’s situation. How would you approach that task?</p>
<p id="9cf501e9-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Neither of these assignments requires you to explain how you conducted your research. Your supervisor and the client will be focused on the substantive results of your research, not on the process. But each <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="34" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-34">p. 34</span>of these research tasks is different in terms of the complexity of the research required, the work to be produced, and the deadline for completion. Accordingly, you would use a different research process for each one. Knowing how to vary your research process to suit the task you need to accomplish is vital for performing complete, accurate, and efficient research.</p>
<p id="9cf528fa-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chapter 1 gave you a brief introduction to the source-driven and content-driven approaches to research and summarized the research planning process. This chapter will explain these search approaches in more detail so you can learn how to assess which approach is best for the specific research tasks you will be asked to do as a student and in legal practice. This assessment is important for effective research planning. As you read this chapter, consider how you might approach the research tasks described above. The last section of this chapter sets out possible approaches to these assignments. You can compare your approaches with those outlined in Section D.</p>

<p id="9cf52900-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The source-driven approach can be used with virtually any source of information: print, Lexis Advance, Westlaw, Bloomberg Law, and other providers of legal information. When you use the source-driven approach, you will select a source to search, search for content within the source, and read and evaluate the information you find.</p>
<div id="9cf52901-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="9cf52902-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d">1.&nbsp;WHAT SOURCE(S) WILL BE INCLUDED IN MY SEARCH?</p></h3></div>

<p id="9cf52903-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With the source-driven approach, only the publication(s) you select will be included in the search. In print, each publication is a separate book or set of books, and, as explained in Chapter 1, the publication will often be organized by jurisdiction and type of authority. For example, each set of statutes for each jurisdiction is in a separate set of books. The California state code is in one set of books, and the Illinois state code is in another. Therefore, the source you would select to research California statutes is the California state code.</p>
<p id="9cf52904-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="35" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-35">p. 35</span>Online services typically divide individual sources of information into separate databases organized by jurisdiction and type of authority, although some databases will combine related information. For example, in Westlaw, Lexis Advance, and Bloomberg Law, you could research California statutes by selecting the California code database and Illinois statutes by selecting the Illinois code database, but a database containing all state codes is also available in each of those services.</p>
<p id="9cf55015-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To research effectively with the source-driven approach, you need to know two things: the range of publications or databases available to you and the type of source you want to research. You have to know that a publication or database exists to select it as a source. You also have to have at least a general idea about the type of information you need so you can select a source that contains that information. If you do not realize that an issue is likely one of federal law instead of state law or statutory law instead of common law, you may have trouble finding relevant information because you will not be looking in the right source or sources. Conversely, however, when you know the source of the information you need, researching only that source is efficient because all the information you find will be from the appropriate source.</p>

<p id="9cf55018-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once you have selected a source, you are ready to search for information within that source. In print or online, you can search by subject. Online providers also allow you to execute word searches. Both of these methods of searching are discussed below.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead" id="9cf55019-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d">
<div class="epub-heading  left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="9cf5501a-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d">a.&nbsp;Subject Searching</p></div>
<p id="9cf5501b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You can search for information within a specific publication by subject using the publication’s table of contents or index. The index will usually contain more detail than the table of contents, and because it is organized by subject, will contain cross-references to related material. Online providers also often offer specialized subject-searching tools, such as a directory of subject area topics.</p>
<p id="9cf5501c-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One advantage to subject searching is that if the concept you are searching is described with commonly used words, an index or other subject compilation will reference only significant discussions of the concept, not every occurrence of commonly used words. For example, virtually every civil law suit is initiated by the filing of a document called a complaint. “Complaint,” however, is both a legal term of art and a common, everyday word. If you wanted to research “complaints,” you would want references to the document used to initiate a civil suit, not <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="36" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-36">p. 36</span>to the everyday use of the term. Subject-searching tools like an index prioritize the information within a source to help direct you to the most important information even when the topic you are researching is described with commonly used words.</p>
<p id="9cf5501d-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another advantage of subject searching is that index cross-references will point you in the right direction if you look up terms that are close to, but perhaps not exactly on point with, the topic you are researching. For example, a concept in contract law called the “mailbox” rule is also known as the “deposit acceptance” rule and the “postal acceptance” rule. If you knew one of those terms but not the others, index cross-references could direct you to an alternative entry containing relevant information under a different heading.</p>
<p id="9cf5772e-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, if you want to search for terms or topics that the publisher did not include in the index or subject compilation, you have no way to find the information you need. And if the publisher has compiled the material using topic names that are completely unfamiliar to you, you may not be able to find index or subject entries that are helpful.</p>
</div>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead" id="9cf5772f-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d">
<div class="epub-heading  left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="9cf57730-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d">b.&nbsp;Word Searching</p></div>
<p id="9cf57731-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Word searching is a search option when you research online. You have probably executed thousands of word searches in search engines like Google. Different services offer different options for word searching that may include terms and connectors searching, natural language searching, or plain language searching. The various types of word searches are discussed in Chapter 10.</p>
<p id="9cf57732-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because word searches look for specific terms, you can establish your own search criteria without regard for whether the publisher included those words in the index. This can be helpful for fact-specific research, such as when you are searching for cases with specific facts similar to the facts of your research issue, or when the applicable legal concepts are expressed with relatively unique phrasing, such as “negligence per se,” a well-known tort doctrine.</p>
<p id="9cf57733-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But because a word search focuses on individual words in a document instead of general concepts, it can retrieve irrelevant documents or miss important documents. For example, executing a word search for a commonly used term such as “complaint” can retrieve many documents that use the term in an everyday sense instead of as a term of art. Although all concepts must ultimately be expressed in words, a literal search for the individual terms that express a general concept may not be focused enough to be as effective as a subject search. Conversely, a word search for the “mailbox” rule in a source that uses the alternative label “deposit acceptance” rule to characterize the concept may miss important documents because the search term “mailbox” will not appear in that source.</p>

<p id="9cf59e46-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The content-driven approach uses the same steps as the source-driven approach, but it modifies the order of the steps. With content-driven research, you can execute a word search for specific content before you select a source.</p>

<p id="9cf59e49-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With services such as Lexis Advance, Westlaw, and Bloomberg Law, you can do a true general search for information from all jurisdictions and all types of authority, much as you search for content without regard to source in Google. Although this sort of broad search is possible, it is not likely to be a strategy you will use often. What you are more likely to do is pre-filter or narrow the scope of your research before you execute a search for specific content. For example, if you pre-filter by selecting a specific jurisdiction, the search results will be limited to sources from that jurisdiction but will include many types of information, including cases, statutes, secondary sources, court filings, and the like.</p>
<p id="9cf59e4a-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When you search this way, you may retrieve hundreds or thousands of documents. Your task then becomes one of narrowing the results to target the information you need. You can narrow or filter the results by general document characteristics, such as type of authority or level of court. You can also filter by specific content by searching for terms within the results.</p>
<p id="9cf59e4b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The advantage of this approach is that it may prompt you to review sources you would not otherwise have considered. For example, if you thought an issue was governed by common law, but in fact, a statute applied to the issue, the general search may retrieve the relevant statute. The disadvantage is that a search that retrieves a large number of documents may be overwhelming, especially if you do not know enough about the issue to filter the results effectively. Another caution is the need to pay close attention to differences among sources of information. Regulations issued by agencies may look very similar to statutes. Briefs and other court filings may look very similar to a court’s opinion, but only the opinion constitutes legal authority. When all sources of information are combined in a single search result, it is easy to lose track of the authoritative value of an individual document.</p>

<p id="9cf5c55e-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When you execute a word search, the search engine searches a database of documents and retrieves those that meet the criteria you set for the <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="38" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-38">p. 38</span>search. To do this, the search engine uses an algorithm, or set of rules, to evaluate the search criteria and the documents in the database. Legal research services use three types of search algorithms: terms and connectors (also called Boolean), natural language, and plain language.</p>
<p id="9cf5c55f-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The type of search you execute will affect the content of the results. A terms and connectors or natural language search will retrieve documents that include one or more of your search terms. A plain language search retrieves not only documents that contain your search term(s), but also other content that the search algorithm has identified as relevant to your search term(s). The differences among search algorithms means the same search executed in multiple services can retrieve somewhat different content.</p>

<p id="9cf5c564-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now that you have read about the source-driven and content-driven approaches to research, consider how you might approach the research tasks described at the beginning of this chapter. Compare your approach with the potential research strategies outlined below.</p>
<p id="9cf5c565-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The scenario involved disposition of assets upon dissolution of a non-marital relationship:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="9cf5c566-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Your client recently ended a long-term relationship with her partner. She and her partner never participated in a formal marriage ceremony, but they had always planned to get married “someday.” They lived together for five years and referred to each other as husband and wife. Your client and her former partner orally agreed to provide support for each other, and your client’s former partner repeatedly made statements like, “What’s mine is yours.” Your client wants to know if she is entitled to part of the value of the assets her former partner acquired during their relationship or to any support payments.</p>
</div>
<p id="9cf5ec77-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first task was to determine whether the parties’ relationship qualified as a common-law or “informal” marriage under the state’s family law statutes and summarize your research by the end of the day.</p>
<p id="9cf5ec78-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="39" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-39">p. 39</span>For this task, your supervisor has given you some direction about the type of authority you need to locate: family law statutes. The statutes will likely set out the requirements for establishing a common-law marriage. The statutory language alone, however, may not fully answer the question. For example, if the statutory language does not say how long people must hold themselves out as married to establish a common-law marriage, cases interpreting the statute may provide some guidance.</p>
<p id="9cf5ec79-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After you generate your search terms, using a source-driven approach would be a good way to accomplish your research task. You know the jurisdiction and type of authority you need, so you can limit your search to the state code. This will reduce the number of documents you locate and make it easier to evaluate what you have found. Your search terms would relate to the legal theory you have been instructed to research. Looking up index entries or executing word searches for terms such as “common-law marriage” or “informal marriage” would likely lead you in the right direction.</p>
<p id="9cf5ec7a-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once you locate the relevant provision(s) of the code, you can read the language to determine the requirements for this type of marriage. Research notes accompanying the statute will likely summarize cases interpreting the statute, making it easy for you to locate and read pertinent cases. Given the short deadline for reporting the results of your research, this would be a good approach for making a preliminary assessment of the law so that you and your supervisor can decide whether further research is appropriate.</p>
<p id="9cf5ec7b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now consider the second task: to research any legal theories that might apply to your client’s situation. This is a more complex research task because you have not been instructed to research any specific legal theory or type of authority. Your job is to identify the theories that potentially provide a remedy. Unless you are already familiar with applicable legal rules, you will need to begin in a more general way by learning about potential theories of recovery and then evaluating the potential success of those theories under your state’s law. This work could be accomplished with either a source-driven or content-driven approach.</p>
<p id="9cf5ec7c-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Again, you would begin by generating search terms. Terms relating to property rights of unmarried cohabitants or boyfriend and girlfriend living together would likely be relevant. From there, you could use a source-driven approach for your research. You know that your state is the controlling jurisdiction, but you may not know which type(s) of binding primary authority will apply to your client’s situation. Recall from Chapter 1, however, that secondary authorities can be a good starting point for research when you need background information because they cite, analyze, and explain the law. You could begin your research by selecting a secondary source. Chapter 4, on secondary source research, describes a range of secondary sources you could use to obtain background information. One that might be useful is <i>American Jurisprudence</i>, Second Edition, a legal encyclopedia with general <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="40" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-40">p. 40</span>information about a wide range of legal issues. You could use <i>American Jurisprudence</i> in print or online to search for content related to property rights of unmarried cohabitants. The results of your search would reveal that legal rules relating to detrimental reliance on a promise, commonlaw marriage, and breach of contract (among other theories) may apply to your client’s situation. You could then use this information to search for relevant cases and statutes to determine whether your client might be able to prevail under these or other theories.</p>
<p id="9cf5ec7d-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another option would be to use a content-driven approach in Lexis Advance, Westlaw, or Bloomberg Law. You would likely pre-filter the search by selecting your state as the jurisdiction. By searching for content related to property rights of unmarried cohabitants, you could retrieve secondary sources, cases, statutes, and other material that may be germane to your client’s situation. After executing a search, you could filter this information according to any number of criteria and read what you found to identify rules that might apply to your client’s situation. For example, you might retrieve secondary sources describing detrimental reliance on a promise, a statute regarding the status of common-law marriage in your state, and a case analyzing a breach of contract claim by an unmarried person against a former partner. The search might also retrieve documents relating to domestic violence, wills and estates, same-sex marriage, or any number of other legal matters that could arise between unmarried partners but that do not apply to your client’s situation. With no limitation on the type of authority, the search would likely retrieve several hundred to several thousand documents, making the post-search filtering process critical to identifying relevant information.</p>
<p id="9cf5ec7e-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The differences between the source-and content-driven approaches can seem abstract when you read a textual description of the research process. When you start doing research, the differences will become readily apparent. You might try searching for information about the property rights of unmarried cohabitants in your state using the source-and content-driven approaches to see how the results differ and which you think is most effective. More detailed information on research planning appears in Chapter 11.</p>
<p id="9cf6138f-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As you begin conducting research independently, you may find yourself gravitating toward the content-driven process. It will likely feel familiar because it strives to replicate the types of online searching everyone does on a regular basis, and it has appealing features that make it a good choice for many types of research. It is worthwhile for you to learn effective content-driven searching.</p>
<p id="9cf61390-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nevertheless, it is important for you to gain facility with source-driven searching as well. Source-driven searching is often the most effective way to conduct research, which is why it remains an option in services that also offer content-driven searching. Many employers continue to rely on providers of legal information that offer only <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="41" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-41">p. 41</span>source-driven searching. And some employers have invested thousands of dollars in print collections and see more benefit in having their attorneys use those resources than in investing in new online services.</p>
<p id="9cf61391-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Incentives such as reward points that can be redeemed for products may also provide inducements unrelated to your research goals to use particular research services. There is nothing wrong with these incentives as long as you understand that they are marketing efforts by commercial entities directed toward you as a consumer of information products. You do not rely exclusively on sellers’ marketing messages when making pur-chases in your daily life. You should not do so when you select research services, either. As a consumer, you should make your own assessment of the resources available to you so that you can employ search processes most in line with your professional goals and needs.<div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="42" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-42">p. 42</span></p>

<p id="9cf7c144-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As you read in Chapter 1, primary authority refers to sources of legal rules, such as cases, statutes, and administrative regulations. Secondary sources, by contrast, provide commentary on the law. Although they are not binding on courts and are not cited as frequently as primary sources, secondary sources are excellent research tools. Because they often summarize or collect authorities from a variety of jurisdictions, they can help you find binding or nonbinding primary authority on a subject. They also often provide narrative explanations of complex concepts that would be difficult for a beginning researcher to grasp thoroughly simply from reading primary sources. Equipped with a solid understanding of the background of an area of law, you will be better able to locate and evaluate primary authority on your research issue.</p>
<div id="9cf7c145-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="9cf80f66-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d">1.&nbsp;WHEN SECONDARY SOURCES WILL BE MOST USEFUL</p></h3></div>

<p id="9cf80f67-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Secondary sources will be most useful to you in the following situations:</p>
<p id="9cf80f68-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>(1)WHEN YOU ARE RESEARCHING AN AREA OF LAW WITH WHICH YOU ARE UNFAMILIAR.</b> Secondary sources can give you the necessary background to generate search terms. They can also lead you directly to primary authorities.</p>
<p id="9cf83679-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="44" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-44">p. 44</span>(2)WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING FOR NONBINDING PRIMARY AUTHORITY BUT DO NOT KNOW HOW TO NARROW THE JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE LIKELY TO HAVE USEFUL INFORMATION.</b> If you need to find nonbinding primary authority on a subject, conducting a nationwide survey of the law on the topic is not likely to be an efficient research strategy. Secondary sources can help you locate nonbinding authority relevant to your research issue.</p>
<p id="9cf8367a-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>(3)WHEN YOU ARE RESEARCHING AN UNDEVELOPED AREA OF THE LAW.</b> When you are researching a question of first impression, commentators may have analyzed how courts should rule on the issue.</p>
<p id="9cf8367b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>(4)WHEN AN INITIAL SEARCH OF PRIMARY SOURCES YIELDS EITHER NO AUTHOR-ITY OR TOO MUCH AUTHORITY.</b> If you are unable to find any authority at all on a topic, you may not be looking in the right places. Secondary sources can educate you on the subject in a way that may allow you to expand or refocus your research efforts. When your search yields an unmanageable amount of information, secondary sources can do two things. First, their citations to primary authority can help you identify the most important authorities pertaining to the research issue. Second, they can provide you with information that may help you narrow your search or weed out irrelevant sources.</p>
</div>
<div id="9cf8367c-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="9cf8367d-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d">2.&nbsp;LIMITS ON THE APPROPRIATE USE OF SECONDARY SOURCES</p></h3></div>

<p id="9cf8367e-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Knowing when <i>not</i> to use secondary sources is also important. As noted above, secondary sources are not binding on courts. Therefore, you will not ordinarily cite them in briefs or memoranda. This is especially true if you use secondary sources to lead you to primary authority. It is important never to rely exclusively on a discussion of a primary authority that appears in a secondary source. If you are discussing a primary authority in a legal analysis, you must read that authority yourself and update your research to make sure it is current.</p>
<p id="9cf8367f-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is true for two reasons. First, a summary of a primary authority might not include all of the information necessary to your analysis. It is important to read the primary authority for yourself to make sure you represent it correctly and thoroughly in your analysis.</p>
<p id="9cf83680-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the information in the secondary source might not be completely current. Although most secondary sources are updated on a regular basis, the law can change at any time. The source may contain incomplete information simply because of the inevitable time lag between changes to the law and the publication of a supplement. One mistake some beginning researchers make is citing a secondary source for the text of a case or statute without checking to make sure that the case has not been overturned or that the statute has not been changed. Another potential error is citing a secondary source for a proposition <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="45" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-45">p. 45</span>about the state of the law generally, such as, “Forty-two states now recognize a cause of action for invasion of privacy based on disclosure of private facts.” While statements of that nature were probably true when the secondary source was written, other states may have acted, or some of those noted may have changed their law, in the intervening time period. Accordingly, secondary sources should only be used as a starting point for locating primary authority, not an ending point.</p>

<p id="9cf85d93-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This section describes the following commonly used secondary sources: legal encyclopedias, treatises, legal periodicals, <i>American Law Reports</i>, Restatements of the law, and uniform laws and model acts.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead" id="9cf85d94-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d">
<div class="epub-heading  left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="9cf85d95-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d">a.&nbsp;Legal Encyclopedias</p></div>
<p id="9cf85d96-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Legal encyclopedias are just like the general subject encyclopedias you have used in the past, except they are limited in scope to legal subjects. Legal encyclopedias provide a general overview of the law on a variety of topics. They do not provide analysis or suggest solutions to conflicts in the law. Instead, they simply report on the general state of the law. Because encyclopedias cover the law in such a general way, you will usually use them to get background information on your research topic and, to a lesser extent, to locate citations to primary authority. You will rarely, if ever, cite a legal encyclopedia.</p>
<p id="9cf85d97-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are two general legal encyclopedias, <i>American Jurisprudence</i>, Second Edition (Am. Jur. 2d) and <i>Corpus Juris Secundum</i> (C.J.S.). In addition, encyclopedias are published for many individual states (e.g., <i>California Jurisprudence</i>, <i>Maryland Law Encyclopedia</i>, and <i>Michigan Law and Practice</i>). When you are researching a question of state law, state encyclopedias are often more helpful than general encyclopedias for two reasons. First, the summary of the law will be tailored to the law of that state, and therefore is likely to be more helpful. Second, the citations to primary authority will be from the controlling jurisdiction. Consequently, state encyclopedias can be more useful for leading you to primary sources.</p>
</div>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead" id="9cf85d98-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d">
<div class="epub-heading  left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="9cf884a9-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d">b.&nbsp;Treatises</p></div>
<p id="9cf884aa-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Treatises have a narrower focus than legal encyclopedias. Where legal encyclopedias provide a general overview of a broad range of topics, treatises generally provide in-depth treatment of a single subject, such as torts or constitutional law. The goal of a treatise is to address in a systematic fashion all of the major topics within a subject area. Treatises often trace the history of the development of an area of law and explain <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="46" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-46">p. 46</span>the relationship of the treatise’s subject to other areas of the law. To provide a comprehensive treatment of the subject’s major topics, a treatise will explain the legal rules in the subject area, analyze major cases and statutes, and address policy issues underlying the rules. In addition to providing textual explanations, treatises also usually contain citations to many primary and secondary authorities.</p>
<p id="9cf884ab-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some treatises are widely respected and considered definitive sources in their subject areas. These treatises have often existed for a number of years and may be identified by the names of their original authors, even though other scholars now update and revise them. These well-known treatises may address broad areas of the law (Prosser on torts, Corbin on contracts, Wright &amp; Miller on federal civil procedure) or more specialized subjects (Nimmer on copyright, White &amp; Summers on the Uniform Commercial Code, Sutherland on statutory interpretation). These are not, however, the only treatises. Any book that provides comprehensive treatment of a single subject in a systematic fashion is a treatise, and many treatises exist on both broad areas of the law and narrower subjects. If you use a definitive treatise in your research, you might cite it in a brief or memorandum. Ordinarily, however, you will use treatises for research purposes and will not cite them in your written analysis.</p>
<p id="9cf884ac-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Using a treatise, once you have located it, ordinarily is not difficult. The more difficult aspect of using treatises is finding one on your research topic. Because treatises do not usually have titles identifying them as treatises, sometimes it can be difficult figuring out which sources constitute treatises. The reference librarians in your library are a great asset in this area; they should be able to recommend treatises on your subject. Further, although many treatises are accessible online, some are still only available in print. Your library may keep important treatises on reserve.</p>

<p id="9cf884af-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Articles in legal periodicals can be very useful research tools. Many law schools publish periodicals known as law reviews or journals that collect articles on a wide range of topics. Many other types of legal periodicals also exist, however, including commercially published journals, legal newspapers, and magazines.</p>
<p id="9cf884b0-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The commercial legal press includes magazines such as the <i>ABA Journal</i> and local bar journals, as well as newspapers such as <i>The National Law Journal</i>. These publications are good for keeping abreast of newsworthy developments in the law. Because they are news sources, their articles are generally short and focused more on describing legal developments than on analysis. These types of articles can provide limited background information, but they usually do not focus on the kinds of issues first-year law students research.</p>
<p id="9cf884b1-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Articles published in law reviews or journals, by contrast, are thorough, thoughtful treatments of legal issues by law professors, judges, <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="47" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-47">p. 47</span>practitioners, and even students. The articles are usually focused fairly narrowly on specific issues, although they often include background or introductory sections that provide a general overview of the topic. They are generally well researched and contain citations to many primary and secondary authorities. In addition, they often address undeveloped areas in the law and propose solutions for resolving problems in the law. As a result, periodical articles can be useful for obtaining an overview of an area of law, finding references to primary and secondary authority, and developing ideas for analyzing a question of first impression or resolving a conflict in the law.</p>
<p id="9cf8abc2-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Law review or journal articles fall into the following general categories:</p>
<p id="9cf8abc3-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">■ <b>ARTICLES WRITTEN BY LEGAL SCHOLARS</b></p>
<p id="9cf8abc4-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These are articles written by law professors and other scholars. They frequently address problems or conflicts in the law. They may propose solutions to legal problems, advocate for changes to the law, identify new legal theories, or explore the relationship between the law and some other discipline. Articles by leading or established scholars may be helpful in your research, especially if they explain doctrines or developments in a useful way. The weight of an individual article will depend on a number of factors, including the author’s expertise, the reputation of the journal in which it is published, the article’s age, and the depth of the article’s research and analysis.</p>
<p id="9cf8abc5-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">■ <b>ARTICLES WRITTEN BY JUDGES AND PRACTITIONERS</b></p>
<p id="9cf8abc6-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These are articles written by people who work with the law on a daily basis in very practical ways. Judges often write about their judicial philosophies or offer advice or insights to practitioners. Practitioners may write about areas of law in which they practice. These articles may help you understand a legal issue and provide an overview of important authorities, but practitioner articles in particular may not have the depth of other types of articles.</p>
<p id="9cf8abc7-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">■ <b>STUDENT NOTES OR COMMENTS</b></p>
<p id="9cf8abc8-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These are articles written by law students. Often, they describe a significant new case or statute. They may analyze a problem in the law and propose a solution. Because these articles are written by students, they carry less weight than other periodical articles and are useful primarily for background information and citations to primary authorities.</p>
<p id="9cf8abc9-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These are, of course, generalizations that may not hold true in every instance. For the most part, however, law review and journal articles will be useful to you as research tools, rather than as support for written analysis. You will not ordinarily cite an article if you can support your analysis with primary authority. If you cannot find primary support, however, you might cite a persuasive article. Additionally, if you <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="48" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-48">p. 48</span>incorporate an argument or analysis from an article in your written work, it is important to cite the source to avoid plagiarism.</p>
<p id="9cf8abca-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Periodical articles are unique among legal authorities in that there is no way to update an individual article, short of locating later articles that add to or criticize an earlier article. As a consequence, it is important to note the date of any periodical article you use. If the article is more than a few years old, you may want to supplement your research with more current material. In addition, if you use the article to lead you to primary authority, you will need to update your research using the updating tools available for those primary sources to make sure your research is completely current.</p>

A.L.R. combines the breadth of topic coverage found in an encyclopedia with the depth of discussion in a treatise or legal periodical. Nevertheless, A.L.R. is different from these other secondary sources in significant ways. Because A.L.R. Annotations provide summaries of individual cases, they are more detailed than encyclopedias. Unlike treatises or legal periodicals, however, they mostly report the results of the cases without much analysis or commentary.</p>
<p id="9cf8d2de-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A.L.R. Annotations are especially helpful at the beginning of your research to give you an overview of a topic. Because Annotations collect summaries of cases from many jurisdictions, they can also be helpful in directing you toward binding or nonbinding primary authority. More recent Annotations also contain references to other research sources, such as other secondary sources and tools for conducting additional case research. Although A.L.R. is a useful research tool, you will rarely, if ever, cite an A.L.R. Annotation.</p>
<p id="9cf8d2df-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are ten series of A.L.R. that address United States law: A.L.R. first through seventh series and A.L.R. Fed. first through third series. Each series contains multiple volumes organized by volume number. A.L.R. Fed. covers issues of federal law. The remaining series cover issues of state law, although they do bring in federal law as appropriate to the topic. One additional series, A.L.R.

<p id="9cf92111-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In determining what the common-law rules are, the Restatements often look to the rules in the majority of United States jurisdictions. Sometimes, however, the Restatements will also state emerging rules where the rules seem to be changing or proposed rules in areas where the authors believe a change in the law would be appropriate. Although the Restatements are limited to common-law doctrines, the rules in the Restatements are set out almost like statutes, breaking different doctrines down into their component parts. In addition to setting out the common-law rules for a subject, the Restatements also provide commentary on the proper interpretations of the rules, illustrations demonstrating how the rules should apply in certain situations, and summaries of cases applying and interpreting the Restatement.</p>
<p id="9cf92112-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although a Restatement is a secondary source, it is one with substantial weight. Courts can adopt a Restatement’s view of an issue, which then makes the comments and illustrations especially persuasive in that jurisdiction. If you are researching the law of a jurisdiction that has adopted a Restatement, you can use the Restatement effectively to locate persuasive authority from other Restatement jurisdictions. As a result, a Restatement is an especially valuable secondary source.</p>

Two examples with which you may already be familiar are the Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.) and the Model Penal Code.

<p id="9cf9482a-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You can locate secondary sources using either a source-driven or contentdriven approach. If you use a source-driven approach, the first step will be deciding which type(s) of source(s) to use.</p>
<p id="9cf9482b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once you know which types of secondary sources are likely to meet your research needs, you will need to locate relevant information within each source. Three common search techniques are retrieving a document from its citation, searching by subject, and executing a word search. Some secondary sources are only published in print. Few of the ones published online are available from publicly available websites. Therefore, you will use these search techniques most often either in print or in a commercial database such as Westlaw or Lexis Advance.</p>
<p id="9cf9482c-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If you are just beginning your research, searching by subject is often a good strategy. Most secondary sources, other than legal periodicals, have subject indexes (in print) and tables of contents (in print and online). To locate legal periodicals, you can use a separate periodical index that organizes periodical citations by subject. Word searching is another search option for locating secondary sources in a full-text database and may be an option in a periodical index as well.</p>
<p id="9cf9482d-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If you choose content-driven searching in Westlaw, Lexis Advance, or Bloomberg Law, your search results will include secondary sources. When you view the secondary sources your search retrieves, you can filter the results according to a number of criteria to focus on specific publications or types of content.</p>
<p id="9cf9482e-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many secondary sources cross reference other secondary sources. Therefore, once you have located one secondary source on your research issue, it may provide links or citations to other secondary sources.</p>
<p id="9cf9482f-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sections B and C, below, explain how to research secondary sources in print and online.

<p id="9cf94832-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Researching secondary sources in print generally involves three steps:</p>
<p id="9cf94833-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(1) using an index or table of contents to find references to material on the topic you are researching; (2) locating the material in the main text of the source; and (3) updating your research.</p>
<p id="9cf94834-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first step is using an index or table of contents to find out where information on a topic is located within the secondary source. As with the index or table of contents in any other book, those in a secondary source will refer you to volumes, chapters, pages, or sections where you will find text explaining the topic you are researching. Some secondary sources consist only of a single volume. In those situations, you need simply to look up the table of contents or index references within the text. Often, however, the information in a secondary source is too comprehensive to fit within a single volume. In those cases, the source will consist of a multivolume set of books, which may be organized alphabetically by topic or numerically by volume number. The references in the index or table of contents will contain sufficient information for you to identify the appropriate book within the set, as well as the page or section number specifically relating to the topic you are researching. Locating material in the main text of the source is the second step in the process.</p>
<p id="9cf96f45-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The final step in your research is updating the information you have located. Most secondary sources are updated with pocket parts, as described in Chapter 1. The pocket part will be organized the same way as the main volume of the source. Thus, to update your research, you need to look up the same provisions in the pocket part that you read in the main text to find any additional information on the topic. If you do not find any reference to your topic in the pocket part, there is no new information to supplement the main text.</p>
<p id="9cf96f46-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You can research legal encyclopedias, treatises, and A.L.R.

<p id="9cf99661-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For legal periodicals, you need to use a periodical index to research articles by subject. The <i>Index to Legal Periodicals and Books</i> and <i>LegalTrac</i> are online periodical indexes discussed in Section C, below.</p>
<p id="9cf99662-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Print research with Restatements requires you to understand the unique organization of this publication. Restatements have two components: the Restatement Rules volumes, which contain the Restatement rules, comments, and illustrations; and the Appendix volumes, which contain case summaries. To research a Restatement, you must follow two steps: (1) find relevant sections of the Restatement in the Rules volumes using the index or table of contents; and (2) find case summaries interpreting the Restatement in the Appendix volumes. The Appendix volumes are not cumulative; each covers only a specific period of time. The latest Appendix volume is updated with a pocket part.</p>
<p id="9cf99663-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For print research into uniform laws and model acts, one of the best resources to use is a publication entitled <i>Uniform Laws Annotated, Master Edition</i> (ULA). This is a multivolume set of books containing the text of a number of uniform laws and model acts. You can locate it through the online catalog in your library.</p>
<p id="9cf99664-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once you have located the ULA set, you have several research options. To determine the best research option for your project, you should review the <i>Directory of Uniform Acts and Codes: Tables and Index</i>. This softcover booklet is published annually and explains the finding tools available in this resource. You can research uniform laws and model acts by subject, by the name of the law, or by adopting jurisdiction. Once you have located relevant information in the main volumes of the ULA set, use the pocket part to update your research.</p>

Westlaw also provides comprehensive coverage of A.L.R. Annotations. Many legal periodicals and selected treatises are available, as are Restatements of the law, uniform laws and model acts, and the <i>Uniform Laws Annotated</i> (ULA) set described in Section B, above.</p>
<p id="9cf9bd7a-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Westlaw allows you to retrieve a secondary source by entering the citation in the search box. Source-driven searching is another option. You can search across secondary sources or within individual publications.</p>

One option is executing a word search. Another option is searching by subject by browsing the table of contents for a secondary source. This will allow you to retrieve sections of the publication by selecting them from the table of contents without having to execute a word search. Table of contents searching is available for legal encyclopedias, treatises, Restatement rules, and many uniform laws but not for A.L.R. Annotations or legal periodicals. Westlaw also provides access to the indexes to selected secondary sources, including A.L.R.</p>
<p id="9cf9bd7c-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To select a specific secondary source, browse the menu options on the home page until you locate the publication you want to research. You can choose <b>Secondary Sources</b> under the <b>All Content</b> tab to select a publication. You can also use the options under the <b>State Materials</b> tab for state-specific secondary sources or under the <b>Practice Areas</b> tab for subject-specific secondary sources. On the page for an individual publication you will see the table of contents. If the index is available, a link to the index will appear under <b>Tools &amp; Resources</b> on the right side of the screen.</p>
<p id="9cf9bd7d-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To research Restatements, remember that each Restatement consists of two components: rules (including comments and illustrations) and annotations summarizing cases interpreting the rules. Westlaw combines all of the components for individual Restatements together. When you view a Restatement section, the case annotations will follow the comments and illustrations in a single document. This means that any word search you execute that includes a Restatement will search for the terms in both the rules and the case annotations (unless you specifically limit the search).</p>
<p id="9cf9bd7e-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To research uniform laws in <i>Uniform Laws Annotated</i> (ULA), you must select the database for that publication. One way to access that database is by selecting <b>Statutes and Court Rules</b> under the <b>All Content</b> tab on the home page. A link to <i>Uniform Laws Annotated</i> appears on the right under <b>Tools &amp; Resources</b>.</p>
<p id="9cf9e48f-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You can also locate secondary sources using a content-driven search. After you execute a search, the <b>Secondary Sources</b> section of the search results will include secondary sources such as legal encyclopedias, A.L.R. Annotations, treatises, Restatements, and uniform laws. You can filter the results as you would other search results by publication type, words in the documents, and other criteria. If you pre-filter your search by jurisdiction, Westlaw will include secondary sources from that jurisdiction in the search results, as well as resources that are not jurisdiction-specific such as Am. Jur. 2d and A.L.R.</p>

You can also select the source you want to search from the <b>Browse</b> menu. Choose the option to browse by <b>Source</b> and enter the publication name. If you search by <b>Category</b>, most secondary sources appear under the category for <b>Secondary Materials</b>, but uniform laws and model acts appear under <b>Statutes and Legislation</b>. Within each category, you can select one or more publications. Once you select a publication, you can add it as a search filter to execute a word search within the publication. You may also have the option to view the publication’s table of contents. If so, selecting that option will allow you to search within the table of contents or expand the outline to view the publication’s content.</p>
<p id="9cf9e496-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To research Restatements, remember that each Restatement consists of rules (including comments and illustrations) and annotations summarizing cases interpreting the rules. Lexis Advance separates these two components of Restatements. You can execute word searches or browse the table of contents for the rules component of an individual Restatement. When you view an individual Restatement section, the link to <b>Citators</b> in the <b>About this Document</b> section retrieves case annotations.</p>
<p id="9cf9e497-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You can execute a word search for secondary sources generally by selecting <b>Secondary Material</b> under the <b>Explore Content</b> tab or executing a content-driven search and viewing the results in the <b>Secondary Materials</b> section.

Two popular indexes are the <i>Index to Legal Periodicals &amp; Books</i> (ILP) and LegalTrac. Both of these services index a wide range of periodicals and provide full text access to many articles. You can access one or both through your law library portal.</p>
<p id="9cfa0bb5-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">ILP is divided into two separate databases: <i>Index to Legal Periodicals Retrospective</i>, which indexes articles from 1908 to 1980, and <i>Index to Legal Periodicals Full Text</i>, which covers articles from 1980 to the present and includes the full text of selected articles. LegalTrac indexes articles from 1980 to present and also provides access to the full text of some articles. Both services allow you to search for legal periodicals in a variety of ways, including by author, subject, or keyword.

Some journals now publish exclusively through Digital Commons and no longer produce physical print copies. Because Digital Commons is a publicly accessible repository, articles published here will appear in Google search results.</p>
<p id="9cfa59ec-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">General legal research websites may also contain links to legal periodicals. Google Scholar, a specialty version of Google’s search engine described in more detail in Chapter 5, allows you to search for law journal articles. Sometimes, however, access to the full text requires a subscription to the service (such as HeinOnline) that hosts the article. A few law schools publish special online versions of their law journals. Virtually all make at least their current volume, and often prior volumes, available on their websites. If you have the citation or title of an article that is available online, this can be a quick and economical way to obtain it.</p>
<p id="9cfa59ed-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The secondary sources discussed so far in this chapter are the traditional sources used for legal research, but many non-traditional secondary sources are available online. Sources such as Wikipedia contain information about the law. Free legal research sites like FindLaw often include articles written by lawyers or legal, and websites located through a Google search can provide useful information. These nontraditional Internet sources are secondary sources, and all of the caveats regarding appropriate uses of traditional legal secondary sources apply to them with equal force. Lawyers do not consider these sources authoritative, and it is difficult to imagine circumstances under which you would cite one.</p>
<p id="9cfa59ee-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Using publicly available Internet sites can be both easier and harder than using more traditional legal research tools. It can be easier in the sense that Internet sources are cost-effective to use and can provide easy access to information relevant to your research. It can be harder in the sense that you cannot assume that a non-traditional secondary source is reliable. It is important to remember that any person with a message and the appropriate equipment can publish material online. Because online sources can be updated at any time, they may be perceived as providing current information even if they have not been updated for a long period of time. Therefore, you must take special care to evaluate any secondary information you find on the Internet. Chapter 10, on online legal research, discusses publicly available websites, blogs, and other Internetbased research sources. You may want to review that chapter before using the Internet to locate non-traditional secondary sources. In addition, Appendix A lists websites that may be useful for secondary source research.<div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="63" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-63">p. 63</span></p>

The citation consists of five elements: (1) the volume number; (2) the abbreviated name of the encyclopedia; (3) the name of the topic, underlined or italicized; (4) the section cited (with a space between the section symbol (§) and the section number); and (5) a parenthetical containing the date of the book, including, if appropriate, the date of the pocket part or supplement. Here is an example:</p>

The answer is always a function of where a reader would have to look to find all of the text and footnote information on the section you are citing. If all of the information appears in the main volume of the encyclopedia, the date in the parenthetical should refer only to the main volume. If the section is a new section that appears only in the pocket part, the date should refer only to the pocket part. If the reader must refer both to the main volume and to the pocket part, the parenthetical should list both dates. Here are several examples:</p>

<p id="9cfb6a9b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Legal periodicals are published in two formats. Some publications begin the first issue within each volume with page one and continue numbering the pages of subsequent issues within that volume consecutively. These are called consecutively paginated publications. Most law reviews and journals are consecutively paginated. Other publications, such as monthly magazines, begin each new issue with page one, regardless of where the issue falls within the volume. These are called nonconsecutively paginated publications.</p>

<p id="9d01accc-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The United States has more than 50 separate court systems, including the federal system, the 50 state systems, and the District of Columbia system. You may recall from Chapter 1 that there are three levels of courts in the federal system: the United States District Courts (the trial courts), the United States Courts of Appeals (the intermediate appellate courts), and the United States Supreme Court (the court of last resort). Most state court systems are structured the same way as the federal court system.</p>
<p id="9d01accd-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Judges from all of these courts issue written decisions, and their decisions are one source of legal rules. This chapter focuses on where these decisions are published, how they are organized, and how to locate them.</p>

<p id="9d01d3e0-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a court issues a written decision, the decision is a public document filed with the clerk of the court and is called a slip opinion. Written opinions are collected together and published in chronological order in print. The books containing court opinions, or cases, are called reporters. Although most cases are also available online, they are still largely organized and cited according to the print reporter system. Additionally, <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="82" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-82">p. 82</span>you can tell much about the authoritative value of a case from its citation if you understand the print reporter system. Therefore, you need to be familiar with both print and online sources of cases.</p>
<p id="9d01d3e1-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many sets of reporters are limited to opinions from a single jurisdiction or level of court. Thus, for example, federal reporters contain opinions from federal courts, and state reporters contain opinions from state courts. In addition, each set of reporters may be subdivided into different series covering different time periods.</p>
<p id="9d01d3e2-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A reporter published under government authority is known as an official reporter.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1004C_47375847-3cfa-11e8-bf95-f78ecb0bbffd" href="http://www.html-merge.com/result#note-N1004C_47375847-3cfa-11e8-bf95-f78ecb0bbffd">1</a></span> Reporters published by commercial publishers are called unofficial reporters. Because these two types of reporters exist, the same opinion may be published in more than one reporter. The text of the opinion should be exactly the same in an official and an unofficial reporter; the only difference is that the former is published by the government, and the latter is not. When a case appears in more than one reporter, it is described as having parallel citations. This is because each set of reporters will have its own citation for the case.</p>
<p id="9d01d3e4-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The only federal cases published by the government are those of the U.S.Supreme Court; these are published in a reporter called <i>United States Reports</i>. State governments usually publish the decisions of their highest courts, and most also publish decisions from some of their lower courts.</p>
<p id="9d01d3e5-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Perhaps the largest commercial publisher of cases is Thomson Reuters/West, formerly West Publishing Company. West has created a network of unofficial reporters called the <i>National Reporter System</i>, which comprises reporters with decisions from almost every U.S. jurisdiction.</p>
<p id="9d01d3e6-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">West publishes U.S. Supreme Court decisions in the <i>Supreme Court Reporte</i>r. Decisions from the U.S. Courts of Appeals are published in the <i>Federal Reporter</i>, and those from U.S. District Courts are published in the <i>Federal Supplement</i>. West also publishes some specialized reporters that contain decisions from the federal courts. For example, <i>Federal Rules Decisions</i> (F.R.D.) contains federal district court decisions interpreting the Federal Rules of Civil and Criminal Procedure, and the <i>Federal Appendix</i> (F. App’x) contains non-precedential decisions from the federal courts of appeals. (Non-precedential decisions are discussed in more detail below.)</p>
<p id="9d01d3e7-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">West publishes state court decisions in what are called regional reporters.

<p id="9d02704b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many appellate courts post their slip opinions online as soon as cases are decided. Because a slip opinion is issued before the case appears in a reporter, these opinions are ordinary typed documents. They are identified by case number or party names instead of by reporter citations.</p>
<p id="9d02704c-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After the court issues a slip opinion, the case may be published in print in an official reporter, an unofficial reporter, or both. A published case begins with a heading containing the case name, the court that rendered the decision, and the date of the decision. If the case has parallel citations, the heading may also include the citations to the other reporters where the case is published. After the heading, you will see the names of the attorneys who represented the parties and the judge or judges who decided the case. The opinion of the court follows these preliminary items. If the decision has any concurring or dissenting opinions, they will follow immediately after the majority or plurality opinion.</p>
<p id="9d02704d-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Published cases often include editorial enhancements to help you with your research. Commercial publishers frequently add this type of information, but free online sources typically do not. Editorial enhancements can include a synopsis of the case and one or more paragraphs summarizing the key points in the case. These summary paragraphs are called headnotes. Headnotes allow you to research cases by subject, as explained more fully in Sections B and C, below.</p>
<p id="9d02704e-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Editorial enhancements that accompany a case are written by case editors, not by the court. Although they are useful for research, anything that is not part of the court’s opinion does not constitute primary authority. In a few jurisdictions, the court adds its own summary or syllabus that contains the holding of the case. Unless you see a notation indicating otherwise, however, you should treat only the text of the court’s opinion as authoritative.</p>

<p id="9d02966b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not all cases are published; only those designated by the courts for publication appear in print reporters. The decisions not designated for publication are called unpublished decisions. In the past, the only ways to obtain copies of unpublished decisions were from the parties to the case or from the clerk’s office at the courthouse. This is still true today for some unpublished decisions, especially those issued by state courts. Many unpublished decisions, however, are available online. The federal courts of appeals make many of their unpublished decisions available on their websites. In addition, unpublished decisions issued by the federal courts of appeals since 2001 are available in print in the <i>Federal Appendix</i>, a West reporter.</p>
<p id="9d02966c-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because these decisions are increasingly available online and in print, the term “unpublished” opinion has become a misnomer. A more accurate term is “non-precedential” opinion. Non-precedential decisions are often subject to special court rules. For example, unlike decisions published in the <i>Federal Reporter</i>, those appearing in the <i>Federal Appendix</i> are not treated as binding precedent by the courts, which is why they are described as “non-precedential” decisions. In the past, the federal courts of appeals often limited the circumstances under which non-precedential decisions could be cited, although all non-precedential opinions issued on or after January 1, 2007 may now be cited without restriction. Because of restrictions on citations to earlier non-precedential opinions, many decisions in the <i>Federal Appendix</i> contain notations indicating that they are not binding precedent and cautioning readers to check court rules before citing the opinions. Non-precedential decisions by other courts may also be subject to special rules.</p>
<p id="9d02966d-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although courts have issued non-precedential opinions for many years, the practice is not without controversy. The authoritative value of non-precedential decisions is a subject of ongoing debate in the legal community. Regardless of the controversy, non-precedential decisions can be valuable research tools. Therefore, you should not disregard them when you are conducting case research.</p>

<p id="9d029670-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You can locate cases in several ways. If you have the citation to a case that you have obtained from another source, such as a secondary source, you can easily locate the case in print or online.</p>
<p id="9d029671-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When you do not have a citation, you can locate cases using either a source-driven or content-driven approach. If you use a source-driven approach, the first step will be deciding which jurisdiction’s cases you want to research. Once you select a jurisdiction, you can search for cases by subject, by words in the document, or by party name.</p>
<p id="9d029672-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="89" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-89">p. 89</span>Researching by subject is often a useful way to locate cases. Reviewing summaries of cases arranged by subject can help you identify those that address the topic of your research. You can search by subject in print using a research tool called a digest. You can also sort cases by subject categories in Lexis Advance, Westlaw, and other services. Word searching is another way to locate cases online. This option is available in free and fee-based commercial services as well as some court websites. One additional search option is locating a case by party name. In print, you can use a directory of cases organized by party name. Online, you can use a party name as a term in a word search; many services also have search templates that allow you to enter party names.</p>
<p id="9d029673-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If you choose content-driven searching in Lexis Advance, Westlaw, or Bloomberg Law, your search results will include cases. You will ordinarily pre-filter your search by jurisdiction unless you are researching the law of all U.S. jurisdictions. Once you execute the search, the results will include a section with cases. When you review the cases your search has retrieved, you can filter the results according to a number of criteria, such as cases from a particular level of court.</p>

<p id="9d029679-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reporters are published in chronological order; they are not organized by subject. Trying to research cases in chronological order would be impossible. The research tool that organizes cases by subject is called a digest, and that is the finding tool you will ordinarily use to locate cases by topic.</p>
<p id="9d02967a-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The term “digest” literally means to arrange and summarize, and that is exactly what a digest does. In a digest, the law is arranged into different subject categories, such as torts, contracts, or criminal law. Then, within each category, the digest provides summaries of cases that discuss the law on that subject. You can use the summaries to decide which cases you should read to find the answer to your research question.</p>
<p id="9d02967b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The digest system created by West is the most commonly used print digest in legal research. West has divided the law into more than 400 subject categories, called topics. Under each topic, West provides summaries of cases relevant to the subject. Each topic is listed alphabetically in the digest. Because there are so many topics, a digest actually consists of a multivolume set of books. This is similar to a set of encyclopedias with multiple volumes covering topics in alphabetical order.</p>

<p id="9d02bd96-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The West topics are quite broad. Subject areas such as torts or contracts generate thousands of cases. Therefore, the topics have been further subdivided into smaller categories. Each subdivision within a topic is assigned a number that West calls a key number. Thus, the case summaries within a West digest will appear under the relevant key number. Instead of requiring you to read summaries of all the cases on a very broad topic, the key number subdivisions allow you to focus more specifically on the precise issue you are researching.</p>

<p id="9d02e4b5-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reporters and digests are similar in several ways. Just as there are different reporters containing cases from different jurisdictions, there are also different sets of digests for finding cases from these various jurisdictions. And just as a case can be published in more than one reporter, a case can also be summarized in more than one digest. Thus, the first step in finding cases that will help you answer a research question is choosing the correct digest set.</p>
<p id="9d02e4b6-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="92" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-92">p. 92</span>Digest sets are organized by jurisdiction and by date. The four jurisdictional categories for digests are federal, state, regional, and combined. A federal digest, as you might imagine, summarizes federal cases. A state digest contains summaries of decisions from that state as well as opinions from the federal courts located in that state. A regional digest summarizes state court decisions from the states within the region, but it does not contain summaries of any federal cases. West publishes regional digests for some, but not all, of its regional reporters. A combined digest summarizes cases from all state and federal jurisdictions.</p>
<p id="9d02e4b7-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Within each category, the digest set may be divided into different series covering different time periods. For example, <i>West’s Federal Practice Digest</i>, Fifth Series begins with 2003. Earlier cases, from the early 1980s to 2003, can be found in the Fourth Series of the digest. Ordinarily, you will want to begin your research in the most current series available. If you are unable to find information in the most current series, however, you could locate older cases by looking in the earlier series.</p>
<p id="9d02e4b8-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Figures 5.6</b> through <b>5.8</b> summarize some of the characteristics of West digests.</p>
<p id="9d02e4b9-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To decide which digest is the best choice for your research, you will need to consider the nature and scope of the project. Usually, you will want to choose the narrowest digest that still has enough information for you to find relevant legal authority. Sometimes you will need to use more than one digest to find all of the cases you need.</p>
<p id="9d02e4ba-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>West’s Federal Practice Digest</i> is the best place to start looking for federal cases. If you are researching case law from an individual state, the digest from that state is usually the best starting place. If you do not have access to the state digest, the regional digest is another good place to look. It is also a good place to find nonbinding authority from surrounding jurisdictions. Remember, however, that regional digests summarize only state court decisions, not federal decisions. Therefore, if you also want to find cases from the federal courts located within an individual state, you will need to supplement your regional digest research by using <i>West’s Federal Practice Digest</i>.</p>
<p id="9d02e4bb-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The combined digests have the most comprehensive coverage, but they are also the most difficult to use. <i>West’s General Digest</i> summarizes the most recent cases. It is noncumulative. The Decennial Digests cover earlier time periods. Many libraries no longer carry the combined digests, so even if you conduct print research, you are not likely to use the combined digests.<div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="93" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-93">p. 93</span></p>

<p id="9d038124-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once you have decided which set or sets of the digest to use, the next step is locating topics and key numbers relevant to your research issue. You can do this in three ways:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-decimal">
<li class=""><p id="9d038125-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Using the headnotes in a case on point;</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="9d038126-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Using the Descriptive-Word Index;</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="9d038127-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Going directly to topics relevant to your research.</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="9d038128-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The easiest way to find relevant topics and key numbers is to use the headnotes in a case that you have already determined is relevant to your research. If you have read other chapters in this book, you already know that the digest is not the only way to locate cases. Many other research sources, including secondary sources (covered in Chapter 4) and statutes (covered in Chapter 7), can lead you to relevant cases. Therefore, when another source has led you to a relevant case that is published in a West reporter, you can use the headnotes to direct you to digest topics and key numbers.</p>
<p id="9d038129-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If you do not already have a case on point, you will need to use the index to find topics and key numbers in the digest. The index in a West digest is called the Descriptive-Word Index (DWI). The DWI consists of several volumes that may be located either at the beginning or at the end of the digest set, and it lists subjects in alphabetical order. Once you have identified relevant topics and key numbers, you can look them up within the digest volumes. Digest topics appear alphabetically, and key numbers follow in numerical order.</p>
<p id="9d03812a-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because digest topics are arranged alphabetically, you can bypass the DWI and go directly to the topic you are interested in researching. This <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="95" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-95">p. 95</span>can be a difficult way to start your research unless you are already familiar with that area of law and know which topics are likely to be relevant. For example, cases involving some types of real estate transactions are listed under the topic “Vendor and Purchaser,” which might not be a topic you would have considered using.</p>
<p id="9d03812b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although you might not want to start your research by going directly to a digest topic, once you have identified useful topics through other means, you may want to review the overview section at the beginning of a topic. The list of subjects included and excluded and the outline of key numbers can provide additional helpful research leads.</p>

<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead" id="9d03812c-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d">
<div class="epub-heading  left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="9d03812d-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d">c.&nbsp;Reading Case Summaries</p></div>
<p id="9d03812e-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once you have reviewed the topic overview, you are ready to begin reading case summaries. In general, summaries are organized in descending order from highest to lowest court. If the digest contains summaries of both federal and state cases, federal cases will appear first. If the digest contains summaries of cases from multiple states, the states will be listed alphabetically. Summaries of multiple decisions from the same level of court and the same jurisdiction are listed in reverse chronological order.</p>
<p id="9d03812f-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of the most difficult aspects of digest research is deciding which cases to read based on the summaries. The court and date abbreviations at the beginning of each entry will help you decide which cases to review. If you are using a digest with cases from more than one jurisdiction, paying attention to the abbreviations will help you stay focused on the summaries of cases from the appropriate jurisdiction. The abbreviations will also help you figure out which cases are from the highest court in the jurisdiction and which are the most recent decisions. In addition, many case summaries include not only a synopsis of the rule the court applied in the case, but also a concise description of the facts. You can use the factual summaries to narrow down the cases applicable to your issue.</p>
<p id="9d038130-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even a fact-specific summary, however, does not provide the full context of the case. Using the digest is only the first step in researching cases; all the digest can do is point you toward cases that may help answer your research question. Digest summaries, like headnotes, are editorial enhancements designed to assist you with your research. They are not authoritative, and you should never rely on one as a statement of the law. Always read the case in full before relying on it to answer a research question.</p>

<p id="9d03a843-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The final step in digest research is updating. Each subject volume should have either a pocket part or a separate supplement on the shelf next to the hardcover book. This is the first place to look to update your research.</p>
<p id="9d03a844-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="96" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-96">p. 96</span>The pocket part is organized the same way as the main volume. The topics are arranged alphabetically, and the key numbers are arranged in numerical order within each topic. If newer cases have been decided since the main volume was published, you will find those summaries in the pocket part. If no reference to your topic and key number appears in the pocket part, no new decisions have been issued during the time period covered by the pocket part.</p>
<p id="9d03a845-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The pocket part is not the only supplement you should check. Pocket parts are generally published only once a year. For some digest sets, West also publishes softcover interim pamphlets to update for cases decided since the pocket part was published. They are usually shelved at the end of the digest set. The pamphlets contain summaries of new decisions under all of the topics and key numbers within the digest set. Just as with pocket parts, the topics in the interim pamphlets are arranged alphabetically.</p>
<p id="9d03a846-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some interim pamphlets are cumulative, meaning you only need to look in the one book to update your research. Others, however, are noncumulative. If the pamphlets you are using are noncumulative, each one covers a specific time period, and you must check each one to update your research completely. To determine the dates covered by an interim pamphlet, check the dates on the spine or cover of the book. A table at the beginning of the interim pamphlet lists the latest volumes of each reporter covered by the supplement.</p>
<p id="9d03a847-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Each individual reporter volume contains a mini-digest summarizing cases within that volume. If necessary, you can further update by checking individual reporter volumes issued after the last volume covered by the interim pamphlet.</p>

<p id="9d03cf6b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You can retrieve a case in Westlaw from its citation or by party name if you do not have the citation. Westlaw allows source-driven searching by subject or words in the document, as well as content-driven word searching.</p>
<p id="9d03cf6c-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A good way to search by subject is with the online West digests. Recall that digests organize case summaries by topic so that you can locate cases on specific subjects. You can access the online versions of the West digests in Westlaw in three ways. One way is from a case on point. The headnotes at the beginning of each case summarize the content of the case and assign a topic name and key number subdivision to each headnote. By following the links in the headnotes, you can retrieve a list of summaries of cases that have been assigned the same topic and key number. You can filter the results or change the jurisdiction as appropriate.</p>
<p id="9d03cf6d-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second way to access the West digest system is to search through the digest topic headings. The <b>Key Numbers</b> link under the <b>All Content</b> tab opens a list of topic headings. From the headings, you can drill down through the digest topics to individual key numbers. You can also execute a search within the Key Number System as a whole, without first selecting a specific topic, to generate a list of case summaries organized by subject. A third way is through a content-driven search, as explained below.</p>

To execute a source-driven search for cases, pre-filter the search by following the appropriate links under the tabs on the <b>Browse</b> page. To execute a content-driven word search, you will usually want to prefilter by jurisdiction(s). A content-driven search will retrieve many types of authority. The results will include cases (in the <b>Cases</b> section), as well links to digest topics and key numbers (in the <b>Key Numbers</b> section). The links under <b>Key Numbers</b> take you into the digest to view case summaries under the key number(s) you select. After you execute a word search, you will have a variety of options for filtering the search results.</p>
<p id="9d03cf74-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The organization of the results may be by date or by relevance depending on the type of searching you do. You have some ability to modify the default sort options, again depending on the type of search. It is important to pay close attention to the date and level of court as you review the search results so you can assess whether each case is binding or nonbinding authority.</p>

<p id="9d03cf7a-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The format of a case in Lexis Advance is similar to the format of a case in Westlaw. At the beginning of the document, you will see a caption with the name of the case and other identifying information. The caption will be followed by information about the history of the case and the core terms used in the case. This information will be followed by an editorial summary of the decision. The summary is divided into three components: procedural posture, overview, and outcome. No key number headnotes appear in the Lexis Advance version of a case because the key number system is an editorial feature unique to West. Lexis Advance has a similar editorial feature, however, called LexisNexis Headnotes. These headnotes are summary paragraphs organized by subject that quote passages from the case. Even though the LexisNexis Headnotes usually quote the opinion verbatim, they are not part of the decision and are not authoritative.</p>

In an employment setting, you may be required to use one of these services before using more costly services to keep client research costs low. These services provide access to state and federal case law and offer a number of options for searching. Fastcase has three search features to assist with case research: the Interactive Timeline, the tag cloud, and Forecite. The Interactive Time Line uses visual mapping to display search results. Cases are represented as circles on a timeline to give you a snapshot of the results. The tag cloud displays key terms in the results sized according to their prevalence.

<p id="9d046bea-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Free online sources can be good vehicles for locating cases, although using a general search engine like Google is not likely to be an efficient strategy for comprehensive case research. Two other approaches are likely to be more effective. The first is to review the website for the court whose decisions you are trying to locate. The second is to go to general legal research websites. Many of these websites either include links to websites with court opinions or index their own databases of cases. Appendix A lists a number of legal research websites that may be useful for case research.</p>
<p id="9d046beb-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once you have located a source containing cases, several searching options may be available. You may be able to search by date, docket number, case name, or key word, depending on how the website is organized.</p>
<p id="9d046bec-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Searching free websites has some limitations. You may not have access to subject searching tools. Word searching functionality may not be as robust as in commercial services. The cases you find may not have editorial enhancements. Despite these limitations, free sites can be useful for targeted case research. Government websites may provide access to opinions unavailable elsewhere, including opinions of municipal courts or local agencies. In addition, the Internet is a more cost-effective way to access cases otherwise available in Lexis Advance, Westlaw, or other commercial services.</p>

<p id="9d0492ff-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As Chapter 1 explains, any time you report the results of your research in written form, you must cite your sources properly. This is especially important for cases because the information in the citation can help the reader assess the weight of the authority you are citing. A case citation has three basic components:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-decimal">
<li class=""><p id="9d049300-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">the case name;</p></li>

</ol>
<p id="9d049303-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You can find rules for each component in the <i>ALWD Guide</i> and the <i>Bluebook</i>. Using the <i>ALWD Guide</i> (6th ed.), you should read Rule 12 and use Appendices 1, 3, and 4 for any necessary abbreviations. Using the <i>Bluebook</i> (20th ed.), you should begin with Bluepages B10 and use Tables T1, T6, T7, and T10 to find any necessary abbreviations. <b>Figure 5.14</b> directs you to the citation rules for cases.</p>

<p id="9d050843-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The name of the case appears first and must be <u>underlined</u> or <i>italicized</i>. The case name consists of the name of the first party on either side of the “v.” In other words, if more than one plaintiff or defendant is listed in the full case name, give only the name of the first named plaintiff or first named defendant. In the example citation, Sam Anson would not be listed. Do not include “et al.” when a case has multiple parties; simply refer to the first named party on both sides. If a person is named as a party, use only the person’s last name, but if a company or other entity is listed, use the entity’s full name.</p>

In the citation, the name of the reporter will be abbreviated, so you must also determine the proper abbreviation. In the <i>ALWD Guide</i>, you can find this information in Appendix 1, which lists each jurisdiction in the United States along with reporter names and abbreviations. In the <i>Bluebook</i>, this same information appears in Table T1.</p>
<p id="9d052f5b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ordinarily, you will list the volume of the reporter, the reporter abbreviation, and the starting page of the case.

<p id="9d055677-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The place to find the proper abbreviation for the jurisdiction and level of court is Appendix 1 in the <i>ALWD Guide</i> or Table T1 in the <i>Bluebook</i>. Appendix 1 and Table T1 list the levels of courts under each jurisdiction. Next to the name of each court, an abbreviation will appear in parentheses. This is the abbreviation for both the jurisdiction and the level of court, and this is what should appear in your parenthetical. You will notice that for the highest court in each state, the jurisdiction abbreviation is all that is necessary. This alerts the reader that the decision came from the highest court in the state; no additional court name abbreviation is necessary.

You can also access the West Key Number System from the Key Numbers link under the All Content tab. Executing a word search within the West Key Number System and following the appropriate links retrieves a list of case summaries organized by topic. The search can also be pre-filtered by jurisdiction. Figure 5.19 shows the results of a search for <i>domicile</i> within the West Key Number System, as well as summaries of appellate cases from the First Circuit regarding <i>domicile</i>.</p>

Thus, New York, California, and Illinois cases may appear in three places: (1) an official state reporter; (2) a West regional reporter; and (3) a West unofficial state reporter. Some lower court opinions published in West’s New York and California reporters are not published in the regional reporters covering those states. By contrast, all of the cases in <i>West’s Illinois Decisions</i> are included in the regional reporter covering Illinois.</p></div>

<p id="9d0a5eeb-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Virtually all cases contain citations to legal authorities, including other cases, secondary sources, statutes, and regulations. These decisions can affect the continued validity of the authorities they cite. For example, cases can be reversed or overruled, or statutes can be held unconstitutional. Even if an authority remains valid, the discussion of the authority in later cases can be helpful in your research. As a consequence, when you find an authority that helps you answer a research question, you will often want to know whether the authority has been cited elsewhere, and if so, what has been said about it.</p>
<p id="9d0a5eec-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The tool that helps you do this is called a citator. Citators catalog cases, secondary sources, and other authorities, analyzing what they say about the sources they cite. Some citators also track the status of statutes and regulations, indicating, for example, whether a statute has been amended or repealed. Citators will help you determine whether an authority is still “good law,” meaning it has not been changed or invalidated since it was issued. They will also help you locate additional authorities that pertain to your research question.</p>
<p id="9d0a5eed-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="126" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-126">p. 126</span>Shepard’s Citations is the best known citator. Shepard’s was, for many years, the only citator most lawyers ever used, and checking citations came to be known as “Shepardizing.” Generations of law students learned how to interpret print Shepard’s entries, which are filled with symbols and abbreviations. Today, however, few legal researchers use Shepard’s in print, and few libraries carry the print version. Instead, virtually all legal researchers use online citators. Shepard’s is still a wellrespected citator, and it is available in Lexis Advance. Westlaw also has its own citator—called KeyCite—and Bloomberg Law has a citator called BCite. Other online service providers offer their own citators.</p>
<p id="9d0a85fe-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Shepard’s and KeyCite can be used in researching many types of authority, including cases, statutes, regulations, and some secondary sources. The process of using these citators, however, is the same for almost any type of authority. As this text goes to press, BCite is available only for cases. Accordingly, for purposes of introducing you to citators, this chapter focuses on their use in case research. Later chapters in this book discuss the use of Shepard’s and KeyCite in researching other types of authority.</p>

<div id="9d0a85ff-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="9d0a8600-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d">2.&nbsp;WHEN TO USE A CITATOR IN CASE RESEARCH</p></h3></div>

<p id="9d0a8601-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You must check every case on which you rely to answer a legal question to make sure it is still good law. In general, you will want to use a citator early in your research, after you have identified what appear to be a few key cases, to make sure you do not build your analysis on authority that is no longer valid. Using a citator at this stage will help direct you to other relevant authorities as well. You should also check every case you cite before handing in your work to make sure each one continues to be authoritative. Citing bad authority is every attorney’s nightmare, and failing to check your citations can constitute professional malpractice. As a consequence, now is the time to get in the habit of updating your case research carefully.</p>
</div>
<div id="9d0a8602-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="9d0a8603-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d">3.&nbsp;CHOOSING AMONG CITATORS</p></h3></div>

<p id="9d0a8604-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Shepard’s and KeyCite are the most widely used citators, and they enjoy the greatest acceptance as thorough and reliable services. BCite is newer, so its track record is not as established in the legal community. Other citators include <b>Authority Check</b> in Fastcase and <b>V.Cite</b> in VersusLaw. Google Scholar includes a <b>How Cited</b> tab with its search results. This is not a citator in the traditional sense, but it is a tool that can refer you to later cases that have cited the original case. (The URLs for all of these services appear in Appendix A.)</p>
<p id="9d0a8605-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When you have a choice of citators, you must decide which one(s) to use in your research. The decision will depend on several factors. As <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="127" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-127">p. 127</span>noted above, Shepard’s and KeyCite are the most accepted citators in legal research, but they are not identical. You should use both services enough to become comfortable with them while you are in law school. When you are out of school, you may continue to have access to one or both services. Shepard’s and KeyCite are fairly economical to use, costing subscribers only a few dollars per citation, and many law libraries provide free public access to these services. If you do not have access to Shepard’s or KeyCite but do have access to BCite or another citator, you should use it, understanding that the coverage of the citator may be limited to holdings within that service’s database.</p>
<p id="9d0a8606-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Using either Shepard’s or KeyCite should be sufficient to verify the continued validity of a case as long as you carefully interpret the information they provide. Citators often characterize the treatment of a case by later sources as positive or negative, and this requires the exercise of editorial judgment. Different citators may characterize the status of a case differently. Therefore, if a case is especially important to your analysis, you would do well to check it in more than one citator.</p>
<p id="9d0a8607-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If you are looking for research references, you may also want to use more than one citator. Any citator should provide references to later cases that you can use for research, but not all include references to secondary sources. Shepard’s, KeyCite, and BCite include references to secondary sources, but they do not index all the same secondary sources. Thus, you may get slightly different research results in each service. Of course, there is more than one way to find almost any source, so a single citator—even one that does not include references to secondary sources—may be sufficient for your research when used in combination with other research tools. If you are having trouble finding relevant information, however, consider using a different citator to see if it identifies additional research references.</p>

<p id="9d0a860a-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before you begin learning how to use citators, it is important to understand the terminology and procedural concepts used in the process. A case citator contains entries for decided cases that list the later authorities (cases, secondary sources, and other forms of authority) that have cited the case. This chapter uses the term “original case” to describe the case that is the subject of the citator entry. The terms “citing case” and “citing source” refer to the later authorities that cite the original case. Thus, for example, if you located the case of <i>Uddin v. Embassy Suites Hotel,</i> 165 Ohio App. 3d 699 (2005), and wanted to use a citator to verify its continued validity, <i>Uddin</i> would be referred to as the original case. The later authorities that cite <i>Uddin</i> would be referred to as citing cases or citing sources.</p>
<p id="9d0a860b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="128" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-128">p. 128</span>Two procedural concepts you need to understand are direct and indirect case history. Direct history refers to all of the opinions issued in conjunction with a single piece of litigation. One piece of litigation may generate multiple opinions. A case may be appealed to a higher court, resulting in opinions from both an intermediate appellate court and the court of last resort. A higher court may remand a case—that is, send a case back to a lower court—for reconsideration, again resulting in opinions issued by both courts. Or a court might issue separate opinions to resolve individual matters arising in a case. All of these opinions, whether issued before or after the original case, constitute direct history. Opinions issued before the original case may be called prior history; those issued after the original case may be called subsequent history or subsequent appellate history, as appropriate. Indirect history refers to an opinion generated from a different piece of litigation than the original case. Every unrelated case that cites the original case is part of the indirect history of the original case.</p>
<p id="9d0a860c-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both direct and indirect case history can be positive, negative, or neutral. Thus, if the original case is affirmed by a higher court, it has positive direct history, but if the original case is reversed, it has negative direct history. A related opinion in the same litigation on a different issue could be neutral; the opinion resolving the second issue could have no effect on the continued validity of the opinion resolving the first issue. Similarly, if the original case is relied upon by a court deciding a later, unrelated case, the original case has positive indirect history, but if the original case is overruled, it has negative indirect history. A citing case could discuss the original case in a way that does not include any positive or negative analysis. In that situation, the indirect history would be considered neutral.</p>

<p id="9d0ad443-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Shepard’s uses symbols such as a red stop sign or a yellow triangle to indicate the type of treatment the original case has received from the citing cases. These symbols are called “Shepard’s Signals.” As noted above, Shepard’s Signals also appear at the beginning of a case and in the Shepard’s summary. A list of Shepard’s Signals for cases and Lexis Advance’s definition for each signal appear in <b>Figure 6.2</b>.</p>
<p id="9d0ad444-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is often difficult to reduce the status of a case to a single notation. Determining the continued validity of an original case often requires study of the citing cases. For example, an original case with a negative Shepard’s Signal such as a red stop sign may no longer be good law for one of its points, but it may continue to be authoritative on other points. If you were to rely on the red stop sign without further inquiry, you might miss a case that is important for the issue you are researching. As a consequence, although Shepard’s Signals can be helpful research tools, you should not rely on them in deciding whether the original case is valid. Always research the Shepard’s entry and review the citing cases carefully to satisfy yourself about the status of the original case. You can view any document in the entry from the links provided.

The information in this section will help you determine whether the case is still good law. If a later opinion in the direct line of appeal affects the continued validity of the original case (e.g., reversing or affirming the original case), that information will be noted in the <b>Appellate History</b> section. The citation for the original case will be highlighted so you can identify it easily within the history. Lexis Advance will also give you a visual snapshot of the original case’s history with the <b>Map</b> view. This can be useful if a case has an extensive or complex history.</p>
<p id="9d0b2284-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <b>Citing Decisions</b> section lists indirect history, meaning later cases that have cited the original case. The information in this section will help you determine whether the case is still good law. It will also help you identify additional cases that are relevant to your research issue.</p>
<p id="9d0b2285-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When you Shepardize a federal case, the list of citing decisions will begin with U.S. Supreme Court citations. Federal cases divided according to circuit appear next. For each circuit, appellate cases will appear first, followed by federal district court cases. After all of the federal cases, state cases will be listed alphabetically by state, again with cases from higher courts first, followed by those from subordinate courts. When you Shepardize a state case, the list of citing decisions will begin with cases from the same state as the original case. Then you will see federal cases by circuit and cases from other states.</p>
<p id="9d0b2286-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Along with the full name and citation to the citing case, the entry will note the treatment the citing case has given the original case. Often, the citing case will simply have “cited” the original case without significant analysis. If, however, the citing case has treated the original case in a way that could affect its continued validity (e.g., following, criticizing, or distinguishing it), Shepard’s will note that.</p>
<p id="9d0b2287-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <b>Sort by</b> menu allows you to set the order of the citing cases with the following options: level of court (highest to lowest), type of analysis (red, meaning negative, to blue, meaning positive), depth of discussion (high to low), or date (newest to oldest).</p>
<p id="9d0b2288-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <b>Grid</b> view displays a color-coded grid that provides a snapshot of the way all of the citing cases have treated the original case. Click on a box in the grid to show the list view of the cases included in the category you selected. <b>Figure 6.4</b> shows the grid view.</p>
<p id="9d0b2289-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another feature in the <b>Citing Decisions</b> section is the headnote references. You may recall from Chapter 5, on case research, that headnotes are summary paragraphs added by case editors identifying the key points in the case. If a citing case cites the original case for a point that is summarized in a headnote at the beginning of the original case, the headnote will be referenced in the Shepard’s entry. In the example citation, <i>Uddin</i> discusses a point of law that is summarized in headnote 9. A citing case, <i>Davis v. Accor North America, Inc.,</i> has cited <i>Uddin</i> for the same proposition of law summarized in headnote 9. Thus, the Shepard’s entry includes the reference to headnote 9. The illustrations in <b>Figures 6.5</b> through <b>6.7</b> trace a headnote from an original case to a Shepard’s entry and then to a citing case. You may again recall from Chapter 5 that West publishes many state and federal reporters and adds headnotes to those cases. LexisNexis Headnotes are different from West headnotes, and the two sets of headnotes do not correspond to each other. The LexisNexis Headnotes are the ones that are displayed in the Shepard’s entry.</p>

<p id="9d0b70c3-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Westlaw provides a citator called KeyCite. Like Shepard’s, KeyCite is available for cases, statutes, and administrative materials. KeyCite is similar to Shepard’s in the information it provides, and the process of using KeyCite is very similar to the process of Shepardizing. To use KeyCite effectively, you need to know how to access the service, interpret the entries, and filter the results to target the information you want.

Westlaw’s definitions of the status flags are explained in <b>Figure 6.9</b>. If a case has a status flag, the flag will appear both at the beginning of the case and within the KeyCite entry to give you some indication of the case’s treatment in KeyCite. Like Shepard’s Signals, KeyCite status flags are useful research tools, but they cannot substitute for your own assessment of the continued validity of a case. You should always research the KeyCite entry and review the citing sources carefully to satisfy yourself about the status of a case.</p>

<p id="9d10a084-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Statutes enacted by a legislature are organized by subject matter into what is called a “code.” Codes are published by jurisdiction; each jurisdiction that enacts statutes collects them in its own code. Thus, the federal government publishes the United States Code, which contains all federal statutes. Statutes for each state are published in individual state codes. Most state codes contain the text of the state constitution, and many include the text of the U.S. Constitution as well.</p>
<div id="9d10a085-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="9d10a086-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d">1.&nbsp;THE PUBLICATION PROCESS FOR FEDERAL STATUTES</p></h3></div>

<p id="9d10a087-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a federal law is enacted, it is published in three steps: (1) it is published as a separate document; (2) it is included in a chronological listing of all statutes passed within a session of Congress; and (3) it is reorganized by subject matter and placed within the code. In the first step of the process, every law passed by Congress is assigned a public law number. The public law number indicates the session of Congress in which the law was passed and the order in which it was passed. Thus, Public Law 103-416 was the 416th law passed during the 103rd session of Congress. Each public law is published in a separate booklet or pamphlet <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="150" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-150">p. 150</span>containing the full text of the law as it was passed by Congress. This booklet is known as a slip law and is identified by its public law number.</p>
<p id="9d10a088-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the second step of the process, slip laws for a session of Congress are compiled together in chronological order. Laws organized within this chronological compilation are called session laws because they are organized according to the session of Congress during which they were enacted. Session laws are compiled in a publication called <i>United States Statutes at Large.</i> A citation to <i>Statutes at Large</i> will tell you the volume of <i>Statutes at Large</i> containing the law and the page number on which the text of the law begins. Thus, a citation to 108 Stat. 4305 tells you that this law can be located in volume 108 of <i>Statutes at Large,</i> beginning on page 4305. Both the slip law and session law versions of a statute should be identical. The only difference is the form of publication.</p>
<p id="9d10a089-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The third step in the process is the codification of the law. When Congress enacts a law, it enacts a block of legislation that may cover a wide range of topics. A single bill can contain provisions applicable to many different parts of the government. For example, a drug abuse prevention law could contain provisions applicable to subject areas such as food and drugs, crimes, and public health. If federal laws remained organized chronologically by the date of passage, it would be virtually impossible to research the law by subject. Laws relating to individual subjects could have been passed at so many different times that it would be extremely difficult to find all of the relevant provisions.</p>
<p id="9d10a08a-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the third step of the process, therefore, the pieces of the bill are reorganized according to the different subjects they cover, and they are placed by subject, or codified, within the federal code. Once legislation is codified, it is much easier to locate because it can be indexed by subject much the way cases are indexed by subject in a digest.</p>
<p id="9d10a08b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">State statutes go through a similar codification process. State laws are organized by subject in each state’s code.</p>

<p id="9d10c79f-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As noted above, a code is a subject matter compilation. A statutory code, therefore, is arranged by subject area. Each subject area is then subdivided into smaller units. A section is the smallest individual unit of a code.</p>
<p id="9d10c7a0-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although all codes are organized by subject, not all codes are numbered the same way. The federal code is organized into Titles. Each Title covers a different subject area. Title 18, for instance, contains the laws pertaining to federal crimes and criminal procedure, and Title 35 contains the laws pertaining to patents. For many years, the federal code had 50 Titles. In 2010, however, Congress enacted Title 51. As this text goes to press, the federal code has 54 Titles. Additional Titles may be enacted in the future. Each Title is subdivided into chapters and sections.</p>

<p id="9d10c7a8-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To locate a provision of the federal code, you need to know the Title and section number assigned to it. For example, 18 U.S.C. § 2113 is the provision of the federal code prohibiting bank robbery. The citation tells you that this provision appears in Title 18 of the United States Code in section 2113.</p>
<p id="9d10c7a9-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A state code can be organized in one of several ways. Some are organized by Title like the federal code. Some are organized by subject name. Some have their own unique numbering systems. Regardless of how the code as a whole is organized, state statutes are typically subdivided into chapters and sections.</p>
<p id="9d10c7aa-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To find a provision of a code organized by subject name, you need to know the subject area and the section number assigned to it.

For federal laws, the government publishes an official code, <i>United States Code</i> or U.S.C. Unofficial versions of the federal code are also available. For example, <i>United States Code Annotated</i> (U.S.C.A.) and <i>United States Code Service</i> (U.S.C.S.) are two unofficial versions of the federal code.</p>
<p id="9d10eec6-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition, a published code can come in one of two formats: annotated or unannotated. An annotated code contains the text of the law, as well as different types of research references. The research references may include summaries of cases or citations to secondary sources discussing a statute. An unannotated code contains only the text of the law. It may have a few references to the statutes’ original public law numbers, but other than that, it will not contain research references. An annotated code is a more useful research tool than an unannotated code.</p>
<p id="9d10eec7-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Figure 7.2</b> summarizes the characteristics of official and unofficial codes, and <b>Figure 7.3</b> shows some of the kinds of information that may be included in statutory annotations. Not all sections of an annotated code will contain all of these items, and some will not contain any references at all. The information provided depends on the research references appropriate for the specific section of the code and the content that the publisher chooses to include in the annotations.</p>
<p id="9d10eec8-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Statutes are available from a number of sources, but not all sources provide access to the same information. U.S.C. (the official federal code) is an unannotated code, as are many official state codes. U.S.C. and the official codes for all 50 states and the District of Columbia are publicly available online. You can locate them through government websites as well as free and commercial legal research services.</p>

<p id="9d118b2a-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You can locate codified statutes in many ways. If you have the citation to a statute that you have obtained from another source, such as a secondary source, you can easily locate the statute in a print code or online.</p>
<p id="9d118b2b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When you do not have a citation, you can locate statutes using either a source-driven or content-driven approach. If you use a source-driven approach, the first step will be deciding which jurisdiction’s statutes you want to research. Once you select a jurisdiction, you can search for statutes by subject, by words in the document, or by the name of an act.</p>
<p id="9d118b2c-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Researching by subject is often a useful way to locate statutes. The index to a code will be organized by subject, and using an index is one of the most common subject searching techniques for statutory research. All print codes have subject indexes. If you are searching online, you may or may not have access to the index.</p>
<p id="9d118b2d-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Every code also has a table of contents, which you can view in print or online. Reviewing the table of contents can be a difficult way to begin your research unless you know the subject area of the statute you are <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="157" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-157">p. 157</span>trying to find. Once you find a relevant provision of the code, however, viewing the table of contents can help you find related code sections, as described more fully below.</p>
<p id="9d118b2e-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Word searching is another way to locate statutes. Because legislatures often use technical terms in statutes, however, word searching can be more difficult than subject searching if you are not already familiar with the statutory terminology.</p>
<p id="9d118b2f-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An additional search option is locating a statute by name. Many statutes are known by their popular names, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act. In print, you can use a directory listing statutes according to their popular names. Online, you can use a statute’s name as a word search; many services also have popular name search options.</p>
<p id="9d118b30-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If you choose content-driven searching in Westlaw, Lexis Advance, or Bloomberg Law, your search results will include statutes. You will ordinarily pre-filter your search by jurisdiction unless you are researching the law of all U.S. jurisdictions. Once you execute the search, the results will include a section with statutes.</p>
<p id="9d11b241-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most search techniques will lead you to individual sections of a code. But a piece of legislation ordinarily will not appear in its entirety within a single code section. More often, a statutory scheme enacted by a legislature will be codified in a chapter or subchapter of the code comprising multiple code sections. Rarely will an individual code section viewed in isolation resolve your research question. You usually need to research the entire statutory scheme to ensure that you consider all potentially applicable code sections.</p>
<p id="9d11b242-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, assume you retrieved a code provision applicable to your research issue but failed to retrieve a nearby section containing definitions of terms used in the applicable provision. If you relied only on the one section your initial search revealed, your research would not be accurate. It is especially easy to lose sight of the need to research multiple sections when you work online because individual code sections ordinarily appear within search results as separate documents. Whether you use print or online sources for statutory research, however, be sure to research the entire statutory scheme to ensure that you consider all potentially applicable code sections.</p>
<p id="9d11b243-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once you have located a relevant code section, the easiest way to research a statutory scheme is to use the statutory outline or table of contents to identify related code provisions. In print, you will often find a chapter or subchapter outline of sections. <b>Figure 7.6</b> shows the outline for a chapter within Title 18 of the federal code in U.S.C.A. And of course, all you have to do is turn the pages to see preceding and subsequent code sections. Online sources often either display or provide links to statutory outlines or tables of contents, and most have functions that allow you to browse preceding and subsequent code sections.</p>

<p id="9d11d962-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You are probably learning about rules of procedure governing cases filed in court in your Civil Procedure class. Whenever you are preparing to file a document or take some action that a court requires or permits, the court’s rules of procedure will tell you how to accomplish your task. The rules of procedure for most courts are published as part of the code for the jurisdiction where the court is located. For example, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure appear as an appendix to Title 28 in the federal code. In many states, court procedural rules are published in a separate Rules volume.</p>
<p id="9d11d963-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If you want to locate procedural rules, therefore, one way to find them is through the applicable code. Many procedural rules have been interpreted by cases, and you may need to research cases to understand the rules’ requirements fully. If you locate rules in an annotated code, summaries of the cases will follow the rules, just as they do any other provision of the code.</p>
<p id="9d11d964-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A couple of caveats about rules of procedure are in order. First, understanding the rules can be challenging. As with any other type of research, you may want to locate secondary sources for commentary on the rules and citations to cases interpreting the rules to make sure you understand them. For the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, two helpful treatises are <i>Moore’s Federal Practice</i> and Wright &amp; Miller’s <i>Federal Practice and Procedure.</i> For state procedural rules, a state “deskbook,” or handbook containing practical information for lawyers practicing in the jurisdiction, may contain both the text of the rules and helpful commentary on them. If you locate the rules through a secondary source, however, be sure to update your research because the rules can be amended at any time.</p>
<p id="9d120075-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="159" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-159">p. 159</span>Second, virtually all jurisdictions have multiple types and levels of courts, and each of these courts may have its own procedural rules. Therefore, be sure you locate the rules for the appropriate court. Determining which court is the appropriate one may require separate research into the jurisdiction of the courts.</p>
<p id="9d120076-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, many individual districts, circuits, or divisions of courts have local rules with which you must comply. Local rules cannot conflict with the rules of procedure published with the code, but they may add requirements that do not appear in the rules of procedure. Local rules usually are not published with the code, but you can obtain them from a number of sources, including the court itself, a secondary source such as a practice deskbook, a website, or an online database. To be sure that your work complies with the court’s rules, do not neglect any local rules that may add to the requirements spelled out in the rules of procedure.</p>

Technically, they are secondary sources; their provisions do not take on the force of law unless they are adopted by a legislature. If your research project involves a statute based on a uniform law or model act, however, you may want to research these sources.</p>
<p id="9d12007a-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many uniform laws and model acts are published in a multivolume set of books entitled <i>Uniform Laws Annotated, Master Edition</i> (ULA). The ULA set is organized like an annotated code. It contains the text of the uniform law or model act and annotations summarizing cases from jurisdictions that have adopted the statute. It also provides commentary that can help you interpret the statute. Chapter 4, on secondary sources, explains how to use the ULA set. You can also search uniform laws and model acts online through Westlaw, Lexis Advance, and Bloomberg Law.</p>

<p id="9d120080-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The most common way to locate statutes by subject is through an index. The research process entails three steps:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="9d122791-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Look up the topics you want to research in the index.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="9d122792-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Locate the relevant code section(s) in the main volumes of the code, and evaluate the material in the accompanying annotations.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="9d122793-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Update your research using the pocket part and any supplementary pamphlets that accompany the code.</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="9d122794-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the code you are using contains the federal or state constitution, you can locate constitutional provisions by subject the same way you would locate a statute.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead" id="9d122795-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d">

<p id="9d122797-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The index to a code is an ordinary subject index. It may consist of several hardcover or softcover books. The index will list topics alphabetically. Next to each topic, references to code provisions will appear. The abbreviation “et seq.” means that the index is referring to a series of sections beginning with the section listed; often, this will be a reference to an entire chapter within the code. The index also contains cross-references to other subjects relevant to the topic.</p>
</div>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead" id="9d122798-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d">

<p id="9d12279a-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once you have located code references in the index, the next step is finding the statute within the books. The books may be organized alphabetically or by Title, depending on how the code itself is organized. In U.S.C.A., the books are organized numerically by Title, although some Titles span more than one volume. Sections will be listed in numerical order within the volume.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1031E_47377f59-3cfa-11e8-bf95-f78ecb0bbffd" href="http://www.html-merge.com/result#note-N1031E_47377f59-3cfa-11e8-bf95-f78ecb0bbffd">2</a></span> As noted earlier, an outline of the statute usually appears at the beginning of each chapter or subchapter.</p>
<p id="9d12279c-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Following the text of the code section, you may find a series of annotations with additional information about the statute. See <b>Figure 7.4</b> to review the annotations accompanying 18 U.S.C.A. § 915.</p>

<p id="9d124eaf-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Like other hardcover books used in legal research, hardcover statutory volumes are updated with pocket parts. If the pocket part gets too big to <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="161" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-161">p. 161</span>fit in the back of the book, you should find a separate softcover supplement on the shelf next to the hardcover volume.</p>
<p id="9d124eb0-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The pocket part or supplement is organized in the same way as the main volume. Therefore, to update your research, you need only look up the provision you located in the main volume. The pocket part or supplement will show any revisions to the statute, as well as additional annotations if, for example, new cases interpreting the section have been decided. If there is new statutory language, the text in the pocket part or supplement supersedes the text in the main volume. If you find no reference to the section, the statute has not been amended, and no new research references are available. <b>Figure 7.7</b> shows the pocket part update for 18 U.S.C.A. § 915.</p>
<p id="9d124eb1-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The pocket part for each volume is published only once a year. Statutes can be amended and cases interpreting a statute can be decided at any time. Therefore, some print codes have supplements to update beyond the pocket part.</p>
<p id="9d124eb2-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Supplementary pamphlets may be cumulative or noncumulative. Cumulative pamphlets include all available updates since the pocket part was printed. Noncumulative pamphlets cover a specific time period. The dates of coverage of each pamphlet should appear on the cover. To update your research thoroughly in a code with noncumulative supplements, you must look for your code section in each pamphlet published since the pocket part.</p>
<p id="9d124eb3-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The supplementary pamphlets are organized the same way as the rest of the code. The pamphlet, like the pocket part, will list any changes to the statute, as well as additional annotations. If no reference to the section appears in the supplementary pamphlet, then there is no additional information for you to research.</p>

<p id="9d124eb6-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Research using a subject-matter index is appropriate when you know the subject you want to research but do not know the exact statute you need to find. Sometimes, however, you will know the name of the statute you need to find. In that situation, the easiest way to find the citation may be by popular name.</p>
<p id="9d124eb7-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The index to the code may include entries for acts known by their popular names (e.g., the Americans with Disabilities Act). The code may also contain a separate alphabetical list or table of acts by popular name. The popular name table will tell you where the act is codified. Remember that when a law is passed by a legislature, it may affect many different areas of the law and, therefore, may be codified in many different places within the code. Thus, the popular name table may refer you to a number of different areas within the code. For many well-known statutes, however, the popular name table is an efficient way to locate the law within the code.</p>

<p id="9d1275d3-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As noted earlier in this chapter, you can research federal statutes with the official federal code (U.S.C.) or either of the unofficial codes (U.S.C.A. and U.S.C.S.).</p>
<p id="9d1275d4-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The index and popular name methods of locating statutes are available with U.S.C. The main difference in researching U.S.C. concerns updating. The index and main volumes of the code are published every six years. In the intervening years, U.S.C. is not updated with pocket parts. Instead, it is updated with hardcover cumulative supplements. A new supplement is issued each year until the next publication of the main set.</p>
<p id="9d1275d5-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In theory, using the supplements should be sufficient to update your research. In practice, however, the system presents some difficulties. Laws can be changed more frequently than the supplements are published, and the government is often several years behind in publishing the supplements. To update completely, you would need to research session and slip laws published since the latest supplement. Therefore, U.S.C. usually is not the best source for locating the most current version of a statute, and because it lacks the research references contained in the annotated federal codes, it is not the most useful statutory research tool.</p>
<p id="9d1275d6-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The examples in the prior section illustrate research options in U.S.C.A. The U.S.C.A. General Index is a softcover set of books updated annually. Acts are listed by popular name in the General Index and in the Popular Name Table. Hardcover volumes are updated with pocket parts and noncumulative supplementary pamphlets.</p>
<p id="9d1275d7-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">U.S.C.S. is organized much the same way as U.S.C.A. The index and popular name methods of locating statutes are available with U.S.C.S. Annotations in U.S.C.S. often have fewer references to cases than the Notes of Decisions in U.S.C.A., but the references to administrative materials are often more comprehensive than those in U.S.C.A.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN103B0_47377f59-3cfa-11e8-bf95-f78ecb0bbffd" href="http://www.html-merge.com/result#note-N103B0_47377f59-3cfa-11e8-bf95-f78ecb0bbffd">3</a></span> The nature of your research project and the materials available in your library will determine whether it is more appropriate for you to use U.S.C.S. or U.S.C.A. for federal statutory research.</p>
<p id="9d129ce9-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The process of updating U.S.C.S. research is basically the same as that for U.S.C.A. Hardcover main volumes are updated with pocket parts. In addition, at the end of U.S.C.S., you will find softcover supplements to the code as a whole called the Cumulative Later Case and Statutory Service. Unlike the supplements to U.S.C.A., the U.S.C.S. supplements are cumulative, so you only need to check the most recent one. The supplements are organized by Title and section number and will reflect both changes to the statutory language and additional annotations.</p>

<p id="9d129cec-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chapter 6 discusses citators and how to use them in conducting case research. Citators are also available as research and updating tools for state and federal statutes. Statutory citator entries typically include information about the history of a statute (i.e., whether it has been amended or repealed), as well as lists of citing cases and sources. As noted in Chapter 6, most law libraries no longer carry Shepard’s in print. Therefore, specific information about statutory citators appears in the next section on online research. As explained in more detail below, Shepard’s for statutes is available in Lexis Advance, and KeyCite for statutes is available in Westlaw.</p>

<p id="9d12c30f-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Westlaw offers several search options for statutory research. If you know you want to research statutes, you should use a source-driven strategy to search within a statutory database. You can select a database by following the links on the <b>Browse</b> page for type of content (statutes and court rules), jurisdiction, or topic.</p>
<p id="9d12ea20-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once you select a database for statutes from a particular jurisdiction, the table of contents for the code will be displayed. You can execute a word search within the code using the search box at the top of the screen. Word searching is useful when you are searching for unique terms that are not likely to be included in the statutory index or table of contents. If you execute a word search in a database that includes an annotated version of a code, the search will retrieve documents that contain your search terms not only in the text of the statute but also in any of the annotations. Sometimes this is an advantage in your research. If the statute uses technical terms that are not in your search but the research references contain your search terms, executing a search that includes the annotations can improve your search results. But sometimes searching both statutes and annotations can retrieve irrelevant results if you are trying to search only statutory language.</p>
<p id="9d12ea21-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If you want to search only the statutory language, you can execute your search in an unannotated version of the code or use special search commands to limit your search to words in the statute itself. (Word searching in general and techniques for limiting a search are discussed in Chapter 10, on online legal research.)</p>
<p id="9d12ea22-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You can browse the code’s table of contents by expanding the main headings to view chapters and individual code sections. You can also execute a word search within individual parts of the code by selecting the specific portions you want to search from the table of contents. Table of contents searching is a good option when you are familiar enough with the code to know which subject areas are likely to contain relevant statutes but do not have specific statutory citations. It is also an excellent feature for viewing an entire statutory scheme.</p>
<p id="9d12ea23-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the <b>Tools and Resources</b> section on the right, you will see additional search options, including the following:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="9d12ea24-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> The <b>Find Template</b> displays a list of templates you can use to retrieve statutory citations. You do not have to choose a statutory database to retrieve a statute from its citation, but the template may be useful if you are unsure about the citation form for statutes from a particular jurisdiction.</p></li>
<li><p id="9d12ea25-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> The code’s <b>Index</b> allows you to search the code’s subject index just as you would if you were researching in print. The index entries will refer you to statutory provisions.

If you know you want to research statutes, you should use a source-driven strategy to search within a statutory database. You can select a database by following the links on the <b>Explore Content</b> page for type of content (statutes and court rules), jurisdiction, or topic.</p>
<p id="9d13114c-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once you select a database for the code from a particular jurisdiction, the code’s table of contents will be displayed. You can execute a word search within the code using the search box at the top of the screen. Word searching is useful when you are searching for unique terms that are not likely to be included in the statutory index or table of contents. If you execute a word search in a database that includes an annotated version of a code, the search will retrieve documents that contain your search terms not only in the text of the statute but also in any of the annotations. Sometimes this is an advantage in your research. If the statute uses technical terms that are not in your search but the research references contain your search terms, executing a search that includes the annotations can improve your search results. But sometimes searching both statutes and annotations can retrieve irrelevant results if you are trying to search only statutory language.</p>

Often these sites have search functions that will allow you to retrieve statutes using word, subject, or table of contents searches. As this text goes to press, index searching is available for only a few states. Cornell Law School’s Legal Information Institute site offers a popular name table for the <i>United States Code.</i> Appendix A lists websites that may be useful for statutory research. In addition, court rules of procedure, including local court rules, are often available on court websites. If the code or rules of procedure you need to research are available and up to date online, this can be an economical alternative to research with a commercial service.</p>

First, with the exception of Fastcase, the versions of the codes available from these other online sources are usually unannotated, so you will only find the statutory text, not any additional research references. Second, it is important to check the date of any statutory material you use. Statutory compilations available online may be updated only as frequently as official print sources. If the material is not up to date, you will need to update your research.</p>

The answer is always a function of where a reader would have to look to find the full and up-to-date language of the statute in the print code. If the full statute is contained in the main volume of the code, the date in the parenthetical should refer only to the main volume. If the full statute is contained only in the pocket part, the date should refer only to the pocket part. If the reader must refer both to the main volume and to the pocket part, the parenthetical should list both dates. In making this determination, you should consider <i>only</i> the language of the statute itself, not the annotations. If the full text of the statute itself is in the main volume, you do not need to cite the pocket part even if it contains additional annotations. Once you have determined which date to place in the parenthetical, you should then refer to Appendix 1 or Table T1 to determine whether the publisher must also be included. The following are examples of citations with different date information included in the parenthetical.</p>

<p id="9d18b765-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a legislature passes a statute, it does so with a goal in mind, such as prohibiting or regulating certain types of conduct. Despite their best efforts, however, legislators do not always draft statutes that express their intentions clearly, and it is almost impossible to draft a statute that contemplates every possible situation that may arise under it. Accordingly, lawyers and judges are often called upon to determine the meaning of an ambiguous statute. Lawyers must provide guidance about what the statute permits or requires their clients to do. In deciding cases, judges must determine what the legislature intended when it passed the statute.</p>
<p id="9d18b766-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If you are asked to analyze an ambiguous statute, you have a number of tools available to help with the task. If the courts have already resolved the ambiguity, secondary sources, statutory annotations, citators, or other research resources can lead you to cases that explain the meaning of the statute.</p>
<p id="9d18b767-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the ambiguity has not yet been resolved, however, you face a bigger challenge. You could research similar statutes to see if they shed light on the provision you are interpreting. You could also look to the language <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="194" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-194">p. 194</span>of the statute itself for guidance. You may have studied what are called “canons of construction” in some of your other classes. These canons are principles used to determine the meaning of a statute. For example, one canon provides that statutory terms are to be construed according to their ordinary and plain meaning. Another states that remedial statutes are to be broadly construed, while criminal statutes are to be narrowly construed.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10033_47377f5a-3cfa-11e8-bf95-f78ecb0bbffd" href="http://www.html-merge.com/result#note-N10033_47377f5a-3cfa-11e8-bf95-f78ecb0bbffd">1</a></span> Although these tools can be helpful in interpreting statutes, they rarely provide the complete answer to determining the legislature’s intent.</p>
<p id="9d18b769-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of the best ways to determine legislative intent is to research the paper trail of documents that legislators create during the legislative process. These documents are known as the legislative history of the statute. This chapter discusses various types of documents that make up a statute’s legislative history and explains how to locate and use them. At the state level, the types of legislative history documents produced and their ease of accessibility vary widely; therefore, this chapter discusses only federal legislative history.</p>

<p id="9d18b76c-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Legislative history” is a generic term used to refer to a variety of documents produced during the legislative process; it does not refer to a single document or research tool. Courts consider some legislative history documents more important than others, depending on the type of information in the document and the point in the legislative process when the document was created. Understanding what legislative history consists of, as well as the value of different legislative history documents, requires an understanding of the legislative process. <b>Figure 8.1</b> illustrates this process.</p>
<p id="9d18b76d-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The legislative process begins when a bill is introduced into the House of Representatives or the Senate by a member of Congress. After the bill is introduced, it is usually referred to a committee. The committee can hold hearings on the bill to obtain the views of experts and interested parties, or it can refer the bill to a subcommittee to hold hearings. If the committee is not in favor of the bill, it usually takes no action. This ordinarily causes the bill to expire in the committee, although the sponsor is free to reintroduce the bill in a later session of Congress. If the committee is in favor of the bill, it will recommend passage to the full chamber of the House or Senate. The recommendation is presented in a committee report that contains the full text of the bill and an analysis of each provision. Because the committee presents its views in a report, this process is called “reporting out” the bill.</p>

<p id="9d18dd8c-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The bill then goes before the full House or Senate, where it is debated and may be amended. The members of the House or Senate vote on the bill. If it is passed, the bill goes before the other chamber of Congress, where the same process is repeated. If both chambers pass the bill, it goes <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="196" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-196">p. 196</span>to the President. The President can sign the bill into law, allow it to become law without a signature, or veto it. If the bill is vetoed, it goes back to Congress. Congress can override the President’s veto if two-thirds of the House and the Senate vote in favor of the bill. Once a bill is passed into law, it is assigned a public law number and proceeds through the publication process described in Chapter 7, on statutory research.</p>
<p id="9d18dd8d-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is a simplified explanation of how legislation is enacted. A bill may make many detours along this path before becoming a law or being defeated. One situation that often occurs is that the House and Senate will pass slightly different versions of the same bill. When this happens, the bill is sent to what is called a conference committee. The conference committee consists of members of both houses of Congress, and its job is to attempt to reconcile the two versions of the bill. If the committee members are able to agree on the provisions of the bill, the compromise version is sent back to both chambers of Congress to be reapproved. If both houses approve the compromise bill, it then goes to the President.</p>
<p id="9d18dd8e-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Documents created at each stage of this process constitute the legislative history of a law. The next section describes the major sources that make up a legislative history.</p>

<p id="9d1904a6-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These sources are listed in order from least authoritative to most authoritative. Although some of these sources are generally considered to have more weight than others, none should be viewed in isolation. Each item contributes to the documentation of the legislature’s intent. In fact, you may find that the documents contain information that is either contradictory or equally as ambiguous as the underlying statute. It is rare when an inquiry into legislative history will give you a definitive answer to a question of statutory interpretation. What is more likely is that the documents will equip you with information you can use to support your arguments for the proper interpretation of the statute.</p>

<p id="9d1904a9-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The bill as introduced into Congress, and any later versions of the bill, can be helpful in determining congressional intent.

<p id="9d1904ac-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hearings before committees and subcommittees consist of the testimony of experts and interested parties called to give their views on the bill. Documents from these hearings may contain transcripts of testimony, reports, studies, or any other information requested by or submitted to the hearing committee. Unlike interpretation of different versions of a bill, interpretation of hearings does not require speculation. The individuals or groups providing information usually give detailed explanations and justifications for their positions.</p>
<p id="9d1904ad-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress uses hearings to gather information. As a consequence, individuals or groups with opposing views are often represented, and their goal is to persuade Congress to act in a particular way. This results in the inclusion of information both for and against the legislation in the hearing documents. Sometimes it is possible to ascertain whether material from a particular source motivated Congress to act in a particular way, but this is not always the case. Therefore, hearing documents must be used carefully in determining congressional intent.</p>
</div>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead" id="9d1904ae-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d">

<p id="9d1904b0-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Floor debates are another source of legislative history. They are published in a daily record of congressional proceedings called the <i>Congressional Record.</i> Unlike hearings, which include commentary that may or may not have been persuasive to the committee, floor debates consist of statements by the legislators themselves. Thus, the debates can be a source of information about Congress’s intent in passing a bill. Debates may consist of transcripts of comments or exchanges taking place on the floor of Congress. In addition, members of Congress are permitted to submit prepared statements setting forth their views. Statements by a bill’s sponsors may be especially useful in determining legislative intent. Different members of Congress may give different reasons for supporting legislation, however, and they are permitted to amend or supplement their statements after the fact. As a consequence, floor debates are not a definitive source for determining legislative intent.</p>

<p id="9d192bc6-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You can locate federal legislative history documents the same ways you locate most other forms of legal authority: by citation; by subject; and, for documents available online, by words in the document. Although federal legislative history documents have their own citations, those created in conjunction with legislation that is enacted into law are often organized by the bill number, public law number, or <i>Statutes at Large</i> citation associated with the legislation. Not all federal legislative history documents, however, are associated with legislation enacted into law. As a consequence, the methods you choose to research federal legislative history will depend on the type of material you need. If you are researching the history of an individual statute, your approach will be different than if you are looking for legislative activity on a particular subject without regard for whether a statute was passed on the topic.</p>
<p id="9d192bc7-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If you are researching the history of an individual statute, it is important to remember that not all legislation is accompanied by all of the documents described above. A committee might elect not to hold hearings. Or the bill could be amended during floor debate, in which case the amendment would not have any history to be documented elsewhere. In addition, you may not always need to look at all of these documents to resolve your research question. If you are trying to determine Congress’s intent in enacting a specific provision within a statute, and a committee report sets out the goals Congress was attempting to accomplish with that provision, you might not need to go any further in your research. Often, however, the committee reports will not discuss the provision you need to interpret. In that case, you may need to delve further into the legislative history, reviewing floor debates or hearings to see if the provision was discussed in either of those sources. In other instances, you may need to compile a complete legislative history.</p>
<p id="9d192bc8-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Your research path will depend largely on the scope of your assignment. You will almost always begin with the statute itself. From there, you should be able to use the bill number, public law number, or <i>Statutes at Large</i> citation to locate documents relating to the statute. In most cases, you will want to begin by reviewing committee reports. If the <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="199" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-199">p. 199</span>committee reports do not address your question, you will then need to assess which other sources of legislative history are likely to assist you and which research tools provide the most efficient means of accessing those documents. If your research takes you beyond readily accessible committee reports, you may want to consult with a reference librarian for assistance in compiling the relevant documents. Remember also that a statute may be amended after its original enactment. Legislative history documents relevant to any amendments will be associated with the bill numbers, public law numbers, or <i>Statutes at Large</i> citations of the amending legislation.</p>
<p id="9d192bc9-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If you are trying to find out about legislative activity on a specific topic, rather than the history of an individual statute, you will need to conduct subject or word searches. Because most bills are not passed into law, you may find documents relating to bills that have expired. In addition, you may locate documents unrelated to a bill. For example, committees can hold hearings on any subject within their jurisdiction, even if no legislation on the subject has been introduced.</p>
<p id="9d192bca-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some research tools lend themselves more easily than others to subject and word searching, and some are more comprehensive in their coverage than others. Therefore, you will need to determine how much information you need, such as whether you need information on bills that have expired as well as existing legislation, and how far back in time you want to search. Again, you would be well advised to consult with a reference librarian for assistance in developing your research plan for this type of research.</p>

<p id="9d192bd3-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Legislative histories for major pieces of legislation are sometimes compiled and published as separate volumes. In this situation, an author or publisher collects all of the legislative history documents on the legislation and publishes them in a single place. If a legislative history on the statute you are researching has already been compiled, your work has been done for you. Therefore, if you are researching a major piece of legislation, you should begin by looking for a compiled legislative history.</p>
<p id="9d1952e4-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are two ways to locate a compiled legislative history. The first is to look in the online catalog in your library. Compiled legislative histories can be published as individual books that are assigned call numbers and placed on the shelves. The second is to look for the statute in a reference source listing compiled legislative histories. One example of this type of reference book is <i>Sources of Compiled Legislative Histories: A Bibliography of Government Documents, Periodical Articles, and Books,</i> by Nancy P. Johnson. This book will refer you to books, government documents, and periodical articles that either reprint the legislative history for the statute or, at a minimum, contain citations to and discussion of the legislative history. This book is organized by public law number, so you would need to know the public law number of the statute to get started. You should be able to find the public law number following code sections in U.S.C. or an annotated code. HeinOnline, a subscription service discussed more fully below, has an online directory of compiled legislative histories derived from Professor Johnson’s book. Another good reference for compiled legislative histories is <i>Federal Legislative Histories: An Annotated Bibliography and Index to Officially Published Sources,</i> by Bernard D. Reams, Jr.</p>

<p id="9d1952e7-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>United States Code Congressional and Administrative News,</i> or U.S.C.C.A.N., is a readily available source of committee reports on bills passed into law. For each session of Congress, U.S.C.C.A.N. publishes a series of volumes containing, among other things, the text of laws passed by Congress (organized by <i>Statutes at Large</i> citation) and selected committee reports. References to reports in U.S.C.C.A.N. usually include the year the book was published and the starting page of the document. Thus, to find a report cited as 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2166, you would need to locate the 1996 edition of U.S.C.C.A.N., find the volumes labeled “Legislative History,” and turn to page 2166. U.S.C.C.A.N. does not reprint all committee reports for all legislation. Nevertheless, U.S.C.C.A.N. is often a good starting place for research into committee reports because it is available at many law libraries and is fairly easy to use.</p>

The cross-references are usually listed in the Historical and Statutory Notes section of the annotations. If the statute has been amended, the Historical and Statutory Notes section will explain the major changes resulting from later enactments, and the legislative history section of the Historical and Statutory Notes will refer you to the year and page number of any committee reports reprinted in U.S.C.C.A.N. <b>Figure 8.2</b> shows U.S.C.C.A.N. references in U.S.C.A., and <b>Figure 8.3</b> shows the starting page of a committee report in U.S.C.C.A.N.</p>

<p id="9d1952ee-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most legislative history research is conducted online. In particular, government websites can be extremely useful in legislative history research. No matter which online source you use, your research strategy will still largely be governed by whether you are looking for information on an individual statute or searching by subject.</p>
<p id="9d1952ef-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As with print research, online research into the legislative history of an individual statute is easiest if you have a citation identifying the legislation. Most online services will allow you to search using a bill number, public law number, or <i>Statutes at Large</i> citation. Conducting a word search using the popular name of an act is also an effective strategy. Simply searching by topic or with general keywords is the least efficient means of researching material on an individual statute. It is possible that you could miss important documents if you do not have the correct terms in the search; in addition, you are likely to retrieve material on other pieces of legislation unrelated to your research. By contrast, topic or keyword searching is most effective when you want to find out about legislative activity on a particular subject.</p>

Some provide access to the full range of legislative history documents (bill versions, hearings, floor debates, and committee reports). Others are more limited in their coverage. It is important to choose a service that includes the documents you need.</p>
<p id="9d197a0e-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One form of legislative history you can research online is floor debates in the <i>Congressional Record.</i> The <i>Congressional Record</i> is the record of all activity on the floor of the House and Senate. To research the <i>Congressional Record</i> effectively, you need to understand how it is published.</p>
<p id="9d197a0f-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A new volume of the <i>Congressional Record</i> is published for each session of Congress. While Congress is in session, the current volume of the <i>Congressional Record</i> is published daily in print as a softcover pamphlet; this is called the daily edition. <b>Figure 8.4</b> is an excerpt from the daily edition. At the end of each session of Congress, the daily editions are compiled into a hardbound print set; this is called the permanent edition.</p>
<p id="9d197a10-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The material in these two editions should be identical, but the pages in each are numbered differently. The daily edition is separated into different sections, including sections for House (H) and Senate (S) materials, and the pages within each section are numbered separately. In the permanent edition, all of the pages are numbered consecutively. References to the <i>Congressional Record</i> will vary, therefore, depending on whether they are to the permanent or daily edition. References to either edition will give the volume and page number, but the page numbering will differ for each edition. Thus, 142 Cong. Rec. H8620 refers to volume 142 of the <i>Congressional Record,</i> page 8,620 of the House section of the daily edition. The “H” before the page number alerts you that the reference is to the daily edition. By contrast, a citation to 142 Cong. Rec. 11,352 refers to volume 142 of the <i>Congressional Record,</i> page 11,352 of the permanent edition. Because the page number contains no letter designation, the reference is to the permanent edition.</p>
<p id="9d197a11-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some online services provide access only to the daily edition. This can affect your research in two ways. First, if you have a citation to a floor debate in the permanent edition of the <i>Congressional Record,</i> you may not be able to retrieve it in a service that only provides access to the daily edition. Second, if you locate a floor debate using a word search, the document you retrieve may be from the daily edition even if it is several years old. This may affect your ability to cite the material properly.</p>
<p id="9d197a12-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another thing to be aware of when you conduct online legislative history research concerns hearings. Some online services provide access to testimony provided at hearings, which consists of transcripts of testimony and prepared statements of witnesses, but not to reports, studies, or other documents submitted to the committee. Therefore, if you need the complete content of a congressional hearing, you must choose your research source carefully and may need to obtain the document in print or microfiche.</p>

This is a database containing fulltext legislative histories on major pieces of legislation. Many of these compiled legislative histories contain complete .pdf versions of the legislative documents, including hearings.</p>

<p id="9d19c853-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">ProQuest Congressional is a commercial research service that provides online access to a comprehensive set of legislative documents. Its Legislative Insight database is useful for legislative history research and includes committee reports, bills, and the <i>Congressional Record.</i> Access to hearings depends on the type of subscription your library has. You may have access to hearing testimony or complete hearing documents.</p>
<p id="9d19c854-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Within Legislative Insight, you can search the full text of the documents in its database, or you can search by number. The easiest way to locate all of the available documents on a piece of legislation is to search by number using the bill number, public law number, or <i>Statutes at Large</i> citation. Searching this way retrieves an entry that lists the legislative history documents associated with the statute. You can retrieve the full text of a document by following the appropriate link. Full-text searching is also an option and is a good way to search for legislative information by topic. You can search for multiple types of documents, such as reports or hearings, simultaneously. <b>Figure 8.8</b> shows some of the search options for congressional documents.</p>

<p id="9d18dd80-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Text reads: This graphic shows the most typical way in which proposed legislation is enacted into law. There are more complicated, as well as simpler, routes, and most bills never become law. The process is illustrated with two hypothetical bills, House bill No. 1 (HR 1) and Senate bill No. 2 (S 2). Bills must be passed by both houses in identical form before they can be sent to the president. The path of HR 1 is traced by a gray line, that of S 2 by a black line. In practice, most bills begin as similar proposals in both houses.</p>
<p id="9d18dd81-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The diagram shows that the process is almost identical in the Senate and the House. It begins with the introduction of the bill (either in the Senate or the House) and then proceeds to the following committee action:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-decimal">
<li class=""><p id="9d18dd82-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Referred to committee (Senate or House)</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="9d18dd83-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Referred to subcommittee</p></li>

</ol>
<p id="9d18dd85-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Text reads: Bill goes to full committee, then usually to specialized subcommittee for study, hearings, revisions, approval. Then bill goes back to full committee where more hearings and revisions may occur. Full committee may approve bill and recommend its chamber pass the proposal. Committees rarely give bill unfavorable report; rather, no action is taken, thereby ending further consideration of the measure.</p>
<p id="9d18dd86-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The next step is where the processes in the Senate and House deviate slightly. In the House, the next step is “rules committee action,” which is not a step in the Senate process.</p>
<p id="9d18dd87-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Text reads: In House, many bills go before Rules Committee for “rule” expediting floor action, setting conditions for debate and amendments on floor. Some bills are “privileged” and go directly to floor. Other procedures exist for noncontroversial or routine bills. In Senate, special “rules” are not used; leadership normally schedules action.</p>
<p id="9d18dd88-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The process now continues in both the Senate and the House with floor action. There is a Senate or House debate and then a vote on passage.</p>
<p id="9d18dd89-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Text reads: Bill is debated, usually amended, and then passed or defeated. If passed, it goes to other chamber to follow the same route through committee and floor stages. (If other chamber has already passed related bill, both versions go straight to conference.)</p>
<p id="9d18dd8a-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once both chambers have passed related bills, conference committee of members from both houses is formed to work out differences. Compromise version from conference is sent to each chamber for final approval.</p>
<p id="9d18dd8b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Compromise bill approved by both houses is sent to the president, who can sign it into law or veto it and return it to Congress. Congress may override veto by a two-thirds majority vote in both houses; bill then becomes law without the president’s signature.</p>

<p id="9d1e0da3-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Administrative agencies exist at all levels of government. Examples of federal administrative agencies include the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Agencies are created by statute, but they are part of the executive branch because they “enforce” or implement a legislatively created scheme. In creating an agency, a legislature will pass what is known as “enabling” legislation. Enabling legislation defines the scope of the agency’s mission and “enables” it to perform its functions, which may include promulgating regulations and adjudicating controversies, among other functions. If an agency is empowered to create regulations, those regulations cannot exceed the authority granted by the legislature. Thus, for example, while the FCC may be able to establish regulations concerning television licenses, it would not be able to promulgate regulations concerning the labeling of drugs because that would exceed the authority granted to it by Congress in its enabling legislation.</p>
<p id="9d1e0da4-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="220" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-220">p. 220</span>Federal agencies often create regulations to implement statutes passed by Congress. Sometimes Congress cannot legislate with the level of detail necessary to implement a complex legislative scheme. In those circumstances, Congress charges an agency with enforcing the statute, and the agency will develop procedures for implementing more general legislative mandates. In the Family and Medical Leave Act, for instance, Congress mandated that an employer allow an employee with a “serious health condition” to take unpaid medical leave. Pursuant to the statute, the Department of Labor has promulgated more specific regulations defining what “serious health condition” means.</p>
<p id="9d1e0da5-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In format, a regulation looks like a statute. It is, in essence, a rule created by a government entity, and many times administrative regulations are called “rules.” In operation, they are indistinguishable from statutes, although the methods used to create, modify, and repeal them are different from those applicable to statutes. Federal administrative agencies are required to conform to the procedures set out in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) in promulgating regulations. State agencies may be required to comply with similar statutes at the state level. Without going into too much detail, the APA frequently requires agencies to undertake the following steps: (1) notify the public when they plan to promulgate new regulations or change existing ones; (2) publish proposed regulations and solicit comments on them before the regulations become final; and (3) publish final regulations before they go into effect to notify the public of the new requirements.</p>
<p id="9d1e0da6-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the federal level, regulations and proposed regulations are published in the <i>Federal Register.</i> The <i>Federal Register</i> is a daily publication reporting the activities of the executive branch of government. A new volume is published each year. It begins on the first business day of the new year with page one and is consecutively paginated from that point on until the last business day of the year.</p>
<p id="9d1e0da7-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After final regulations are published in the <i>Federal Register,</i> they are codified in the <i>Code of Federal Regulations</i> (C.F.R.). The C.F.R. is divided into 50 “Titles.” The C.F.R. Titles are subdivided into chapters, which are usually named for the agencies issuing the regulations. Chapters are subdivided into Parts covering specific regulatory areas, and Parts are further subdivided into sections. To find a regulation, you would need to know its Title, Part, and section number. Thus, a citation to 16 C.F.R. § 1000.3 tells you that the regulation is published in Title 16 of the C.F.R. in Part 1000, section number 1000.3. <b>Figure 9.1</b> illustrates what federal regulations look like.</p>
<p id="9d1e0da8-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The C.F.R. is updated once a year in four separate installments. Titles 1 through 16 are updated on January 1 of each year, Titles 17 through 27 on April 1, Titles 28 through 41 on July 1, and Titles 42 through 50 on October 1. Because a new set of C.F.R. volumes is published annually, the C.F.R. is not updated with pocket parts. Instead, new or amended regulations are published in the <i>Federal Register.</i> They are not codified within the C.F.R. until a new set is published.</p>

<p id="9d1e0db1-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You can locate federal regulations in several ways. Three common techniques are searching by citation, by subject, or by words in the document. Once you know the Title and Part or section number of a regulation, you can locate it in within the C.F.R. An easy way to find citations to relevant regulations is through an annotated code. Because regulations implement statutory schemes, you will often begin regulatory research by consulting the enabling statute, and the statute’s annotations may include citations to regulations. The annotations will not ordinarily direct you to a specific regulation; instead, they will direct you to the Title and Part of the C.F.R. with regulations applicable to the area of law you are researching.</p>
<p id="9d1e0db2-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Researching by subject is another useful way to locate regulations if you have access to the C.F.R. index. Each Title and Part of the C.F.R. also has a table of contents, which you can review to browse by subject. Reviewing the table of contents can be a difficult way to begin your research unless you know which agency promulgated the regulations you are trying to find. Once you find a relevant regulation, however, viewing the table of contents can help you find related regulations, as described more fully below.</p>
<p id="9d1e0db3-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Word searching is another way to locate regulations online. You can do a source-driven word search in a database limited to federal regulations or to a specific subject area. You can also do a content-driven search in Westlaw, Lexis Advance, or Bloomberg Law. As long as the search includes federal materials, federal regulations will appear in the search results. Because regulators often use technical terms in regulations, however, word searching can be more difficult than subject searching if you are not already familiar with the regulatory terminology.</p>
<p id="9d1e34c4-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two additional avenues for regulatory research are the telephone and e-mail. Agency staff can be an invaluable resource for understanding the agency’s operations, as well as for staying up to date on the agency’s activities. If you practice in an area of law subject to agency regulation, do not hesitate to contact agency staff for information. Regulatory notices published in the <i>Federal Register</i> typically provide the name and contact information of an agency staff member who can provide additional information about the regulations.</p>
<p id="9d1e34c5-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Regulatory research is similar to statutory research in that you will often need to research interrelated regulations, not individual sections of the C.F.R., to answer your research question. Therefore, regardless of the search method you use initially to locate a relevant regulation, you should plan to expand your search to consider the entire regulatory scheme. Because online sources often retrieve individual regulations as <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="223" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-223">p. 223</span>separate documents, it is especially easy to lose sight of the need to research multiple sections. You can view the detailed outline of sections at the beginning of the Part, as illustrated in <b>Figure 9.1,</b> and browse preceding and subsequent sections of the C.F.R. to ensure that you consider all potentially applicable regulations.</p>
<p id="9d1e34c6-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sections B and C, below, explain how to research regulations in print and online. Most researchers conduct C.F.R. research online because the federal government has made much regulatory material available through the Government Printing Office and agency websites. The online versions of official government sources, however, are updated on the same schedule as the print versions, and the process of updating regulations with official government sources, whether print or online, is the same. Therefore, information on updating regulatory research with official government sources appears in Section C, on online research. If you are updating federal regulations in print, you can follow the same steps using the print versions of the updating tools.</p>

<p id="9d1e5be1-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The C.F.R. is published as a set of softcover books. Once you locate the C.F.R. set, the next question is how to find regulations relevant to your research issue. There are two ways to accomplish this. One way is to use the cross-references to the C.F.R. in U.S.C.S. or U.S.C.A. The other is to go directly to the C.F.R. itself, using a subject index to refer you to relevant C.F.R. provisions.</p>
<p id="9d1e5be2-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because regulations are often used to implement statutory schemes, U.S.C.S. and U.S.C.A. frequently contain cross-references to applicable regulations. Thus, if your research leads you to statutes, the annotations are a useful tool to guide you toward regulations that bear on the area of law you are researching. You may recall from Chapter 7 that U.S.C.S. contains more extensive regulatory annotations than U.S.C.A. does. <b>Figure 9.2</b> shows C.F.R. cross-references in U.S.C.S. annotations.</p>

<p id="9d1eaa1d-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chapter 6 discusses citators and how to use them in conducting case research. Citators are also available for researching federal regulations. Regulatory citator entries typically contain lists of cases and other sources that have cited a regulation. As noted in Chapter 6, most law libraries no longer carry Shepard’s in print. The online citators (Shepard’s in Lexis Advance and KeyCite in Westlaw) are available for federal regulations, and they are explained in more detail in Section C, below.</p>
<p id="9d1eaa1e-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Using a citator in regulatory research is useful for locating research references. Some administrative regulations are reproduced as part of the U.S.C.S. and U.S.C.A. print sets and may have limited annotations; however, the coverage is very limited. If you are researching in print you are likely to be working with unannotated regulations and will find a citator useful for locating cases interpreting a regulation. Even if you are using an annotated version of the C.F.R., the regulatory annotations often do not list every source that has cited the regulation. If the annotations are too sparse to give you the information you need about a regulation, you may find more complete information in a citator.</p>

<p id="9d1ef84d-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the C.F.R. and <i>Federal Register</i> are government publications, they are widely available on online free of charge. The Government Printing Office’s govinfo site is one of the best places to research federal regulations because it provides the official version of the C.F.R. in .pdf format. You can enter a citation, execute a word search or browse the C.F.R. table of contents. <b>Figure 9.3</b> shows the main search page for govinfo. Sites for individual agencies can also be good sources for federal regulations. The URLs for several useful sites for federal regulatory research are listed in Appendix A.</p>
<p id="9d1ef84e-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If you use a government source to locate C.F.R. provisions, pay careful attention to the date of the material you are using. Government sources of regulations usually are no more up to date than the print version of the C.F.R. In govinfo, for example, the official C.F.R. database is only updated four times per year as the new print editions of the C.F.R. become available, although the <i>Federal Register</i> database is updated daily.</p>

The e-CFR is updated daily to incorporate changes to regulations as they are published in the <i>Federal Register,</i> in the same way that commercial services continually update their C.F.R. databases. Although the e-CFR is not an official source for regulations, it is a useful research tool. By comparing the official C.F.R. text with the e-CFR version, you can determine quickly and easily whether a regulation has been changed since the latest official edition of the C.F.R. was published. If you need an official source and citation for the change, you can then retrieve the <i>Federal Register</i> page containing the change in the govinfo <i>Federal Register</i> database. You can access the e-CFR from the e-CFR website (listed in Appendix A) or using the <b>Browse</b> A-Z option in govinfo.</p>
<p id="9d1ef853-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although no reason exists to doubt the accuracy of the e-CFR, there may be times when, out of an abundance of caution, you want to double check your research by updating it with official government sources. An alternate method of updating in govinfo requires you to research two sources:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="9d1ef854-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Use a monthly publication called the List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) to find any <i>Federal Register</i> notices indicating that the regulation has been affected by agency action.</p></li>
<li><p id="9d1ef855-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Use the table of CFR Parts Affected during the current month in the most current <i>Federal Register</i> to update from the date of the LSA until the present.</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="9d1ef856-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The official updating sources available online are the same as those available in print. Therefore, these are also the steps you must follow to update print research.</p>
<p id="9d1f1f67-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The LSA lists each C.F.R. part and section affected by agency action. It is a cumulative publication. The current month’s LSA will contain updates from the date of the latest C.F.R. volume through the end of the previous month. For example, if the latest C.F.R. volume had been published on January 1 and today’s date were October 5, the current LSA would be dated September, and it would contain updates from January 1 through September 30.</p>
<p id="9d1f1f68-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To locate the LSA, choose the option to <b>Browse</b> documents alphabetically or by category (Regulatory Information) and locate the <b>List of CFR Sections Affected</b>. Expand the list under <b>Monthly LSA</b> to the latest LSA and then to the Title of the C.F.R. for the regulation you are updating. Open the document and review the list to see if the C.F.R. <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="229" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-229">p. 229</span>provision you are updating appears. If you do not find the section listed in the LSA, there have been no changes to the regulation. If you do find the provision listed, the LSA will refer you to the page or pages of the <i>Federal Register</i> containing information on the agency’s action. <b>Figure 9.4</b> is an example of a page from the .pdf version of the September 2017 LSA. It indicates a change to 16 C.F.R. Part 1028, which includes § 1028.101.</p>
<p id="9d1f1f69-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The easiest way to find the <i>Federal Register</i> page with the change to the regulation is to retrieve it by citation from the govinfo home page. You can also browse the <i>Federal Register</i> by date to find the page or pages you need. Once you find the page, you can read about the change the regulation. <b>Figure 9.5</b> shows a page from the <i>Federal Register</i> with part of the change to 16 C.F.R. § 1028.101.</p>
<p id="9d1f1f6a-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second updating step requires you to use a table of CFR Parts Affected during the month to date. This table lists all of the C.F.R. Parts affected by notices published in the <i>Federal Register</i> during the current month and will update your research from the last day covered by the LSA until the present. Thus, if today’s date were October 5, the list of CFR Parts Affected During October would contain updates since the September LSA, covering the period from October 1 through October 5. See <b>Figure 9.6</b>.</p>
<p id="9d1f1f6b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To locate this table, access today’s issue of the <b><i>Federal Register</i></b>, which may be easiest to do by browsing publications A-Z or by date. View the entire issue or use the TOC link to locate the <b>Reader Aids</b> section at the end of the issue. On this page you will see a table of CFR Parts Affected for the current month. (Note that a different table of CFR Parts Affected appears in a section with the title page at the beginning of the <i>Federal Register.</i> This table is a daily listing that is not cumulative for the month. Be sure to use the monthly table in the <b>Reader Aids</b> section.)</p>
<p id="9d1f1f6c-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The table lists only the Parts affected by agency action, not individual sections. Therefore, if the table contains a reference to the C.F.R. Part you are researching, you need to retrieve the relevant page from the <i>Federal Register</i> to determine the section or sections within the C.F.R. Part affected by agency action. If the table does not list the Part you are researching, your updating is complete. <b>Figure 9.6</b> shows the cumulative table of CFR Parts Affected During October. No entry for Title 16 appears, so no additional changes occurred during the period covered.</p>

<p id="9d233e91-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As Chapter 1 explains, legal research can be accomplished using both print and online research tools. Frequently, you will use some combination of these tools in completing a research project. Although print and online resources are often used together, this chapter introduces you to some search techniques unique to online research. Earlier chapters discussed both print and online research in the context of individual types of authority, such as cases or statutes. This chapter explains some of the basics of online searching that can be used effectively in a number of services, regardless of the type of authority you need to locate. In doing so, it focuses on research with the major commercial services. But these are not the only options for online research. You should be able to adapt the techniques described here to a wide range of services.</p>
<p id="9d2365a2-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This chapter describes online search techniques in general terms and provides few specific commands for executing them. Research providers update their services regularly, thus making it impossible to describe commands with any accuracy. In fact, you will likely receive training through your law school on the use of at least Lexis Advance and Westlaw, if not other services, and those training sessions will cover the commands necessary to execute the functions in those services.</p>
<p id="9d2365a3-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Legal research providers strive to make their services as user-friendly as possible. Because most of us search online regularly, legal research providers have tried to make their services feel as familiar as general Internet search engines. Legal research, however, is different from routine Google searching, and it is important to keep those differences in mind when you conduct legal research.</p>
<p id="9d2365a4-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="246" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-246">p. 246</span>In daily life, you might go online to search for a specific item of information, such as an address or a phone number. You might use one of several largely interchangeable sources to locate generally available information, such as national news or sports scores. You might shop for something by comparing prices and shipping options from a universe of sellers that are largely already familiar to you, such as Amazon.com.</p>
<p id="9d2365a5-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These types of searches are different from legal research. The searching you do on a daily basis is often intended to locate a single item of information that meets your needs. In legal research, by contrast, it is rare for a single piece of information to answer your research question. Usually your goal is to identify a relevant group of authorities that you use together to analyze a legal issue. Additionally, the sources of authority in legal research usually are not interchangeable; one case or statute will not be as good as another, and it may be difficult to tell at the beginning of your research process which sources you need to analyze your research issue accurately. You must continue the research process until you know enough to isolate the most relevant authorities, not just any authorities.</p>
<p id="9d2365a6-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The experience you already have with online searching will inform your legal research, but it will not transfer completely to legal research. This chapter will explain search techniques and options that will help you build on the search skills you already have so that you can complete your legal research tasks thoroughly and accurately.</p>

<p id="9d238cbb-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Online legal research services can be divided into three categories. Feebased services charge individual users a fee every time the service is used. Subscription services charge the subscriber for access, but individual users ordinarily are not charged for researching with the service. Publicly available services are those available for free online. Appendix A contains the URLs for a number of publicly available research sites, including those discussed in this chapter and elsewhere in this text.

<p id="9d238ccf-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some specialty services are devoted to specific areas of the law such as employment law, tax, bankruptcy, and patent law. These providers include Bureau of National Affairs (BNA), CCH, Inc. (CCH), Clark Boardman Callaghan (CBC), Matthew Bender (MB), Pike &amp; Fischer (P &amp; F), and Research Institute of America (RIA). Most originated as print services that were published in three-ring binders and updated with new looseleaf pages, so they are still sometimes called looseleaf services. If you are researching or practicing in a specialized field of law, these services are invaluable resources because they integrate case law, statutes, regulations, and secondary material into a single source. Even as a student, you may be able to subscribe to their news services to obtain regular updates on developments in a field of law. If your law school subscribes to these services, you can access them through the library’s portal.</p>

<p id="9d23b3e8-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When you research online, you need to follow an organized plan to research effectively. Effective online searching usually involves the following four steps.</p>

<p id="9d23b3ee-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once you have selected a service, you will probably have several options for searching for authority. As Chapter 1 explains, many online research services organize their content by jurisdiction and type of authority and require you to use a source-driven approach to your research. You may be able to search by subject or execute a word search to locate information within each database. Lexis Advance, Westlaw, and Bloomberg Law also offer the option of content-driven searching, which allows you to search for content before selecting a jurisdiction or type of authority. To search effectively, you must decide which approach is most likely to retrieve the information you need. Chapter 3 describes these two research approaches in more detail.</p>

<p id="9d23b3f1-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After you select a search technique, you need to plan your search. If you use a source-driven approach, you must select a database to search or identify the subject headings you want to research. If you use a contentdriven approach, you should determine any criteria by which you can pre-filter your choices (e.g., by jurisdiction). If you use word searching, you must draft a query to search for information. Chapter 2 discusses how to generate and prioritize your search terms. Word searching options are discussed below. Once you have completed the planning process, you are ready to sign on to a service and execute the search.</p>

<p id="9d23b3f4-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After you execute a search, you need to manipulate the results in a way that allows you to determine whether the search has been successful. You may need to view a list of documents retrieved, read the text of individual documents, find specific terms within a document, or use links to other documents. You may also need to filter the results to focus on the information most relevant to your research task. Content-driven searching in particular is likely to retrieve a large number of documents. Filtering the results according to the available criteria is critical to analyzing the effectiveness of your search.</p>
<p id="9d23b3f5-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In reviewing search results, it is important to pay attention to how the results are displayed. The default display may be by relevance, which means the documents with the best match to your search criteria appear first. “Relevance,” however, is a relative concept. A document is likely to be deemed more relevant if the search terms appear frequently <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="250" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-250">p. 250</span>in the document or close to each other. The precise criteria for determining relevance varies by service, and the relevancy ranking of documents retrieved from the same search may vary depending on which service you use. You should treat the rankings as an approximation that cannot substitute for your own judgment about the relevance of the documents the search retrieves.</p>
<p id="9d23b3f6-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Depending on the service and search technique you use, your search results may not be ranked by relevance. It is common for cases to be listed in reverse date order, statutes in numerical order, and secondary sources in alphabetical order. Because most general search engines use relevancy rankings, most of us have been conditioned to review only the first few items in the results to assess the effectiveness of a search. If your results are displayed in a different way, however, the best information from your search could be in the middle or at the end of the results.</p>
<p id="9d23b3f7-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The most useful order for displaying search results will depend on your research task. Relevancy ranking is useful when the search retrieves a large number of documents. Reverse date order may be better if you are looking for the most recent authority on an issue. Often you will have the option to change the default order (from date to relevance or from relevance to alphabetical, depending on the source). Regardless of whether you can change the default setting, you must be aware of the order in which the results are listed to assess the effectiveness of the search.</p>
<p id="9d23da08-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Following these four steps is not always a linear process. You might decide first on your search technique, which could influence the service you select. Even if you follow the steps in order initially, you may repeat some of them based on the search results. For example, after reviewing your search results, you might go back to the second step and select a different search technique. A single search is unlikely to retrieve exactly the desired information, except when you are retrieving a document you need from its citation. One provider offers the following explanation of the search process in the context of word searching:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="9d23da09-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Searching is a process, not an event. This should be your mantra when using [online research services]. Searching . . .  is not about spending time and mental energy formulating the “golden query” that retrieves your desired information in a single stroke. In practice, good online searching involves formulating a succession of queries until you are satisfied with the results. As you view results from one search, you will come across additional leads that you did not identify in your original search. You can incorporate these new terms into your existing query or create a new one. After each query, evaluate its success by asking:</p>

<p id="9d23da11-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The cost of online research is something you might not notice as a law student because most, if not all, of the cost is subsidized. In practice, however, cost is an important consideration. You cannot use research services for which your client cannot or will not pay. Even if your client is willing and able to pay for some online research, you may not have unlimited ability to use fee-based services.</p>
<p id="9d240122-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, just because a service is fee-based does not mean it is a bad research option. It can be less expensive to locate authority through a feebased service than it is to purchase books that would rarely be used, and some tasks can be accomplished more quickly online. In those situations, increased efficiency can justify the cost of using a fee-based service. You should not shy away from fee-based services simply because using them costs money. You should, however, be aware of cost issues and select the most cost-effective research options for your client, whether they are print or online, fee-based or free of charge.</p>
<p id="9d240123-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is difficult to generalize about the cost of fee-based services because many pricing options exist. Generally speaking, Westlaw and Lexis Advance are often the most expensive services to use. Some organizations negotiate flat rates for use of these services. But rates are based on the amount of usage, and the subscription package may not include all types of information available in the service. Charges can also be based on the amount of time spent online, the number of searches executed, or both. Premiums may be charged for accessing certain sources, especially those outside the user’s subscription plan, and separate charges for printing or downloading information also may apply. You can view pricing information in Westlaw by reviewing the <b>Subscriber Pricing Guide</b> under the <b>Tools</b> tab. In Lexis Advance, pricing information is available from the <b>More</b> drop down menu at the top of the screen. Other fee-based services charge for use of their services as well, and you can view pricing information for these services on their websites.</p>
<p id="9d240124-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because pricing varies widely among fee-based services, it is important to investigate cost issues before you get online. When you work in a law office, you may be required to use a service such as Fastcase or <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="252" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-252">p. 252</span>Casemaker before you are permitted to research with Westlaw or Lexis Advance. If the office has a large print collection, you may be required to use some material in print instead of accessing it from a fee-based service.</p>
<p id="9d240125-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subscription and publicly available services are economical choices for your client if they will give you the information you need. Although charges for access to subscription services are usually paid by the subscriber rather than the user, users can be charged for printing or downloading information. Publicly available services are the least expensive option because they involve only the cost of access to the Internet.</p>
<p id="9d242836-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The following strategies can help you conduct cost-effective research:</p>

<p id="9d242839-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of the best ways to cut costs is to draft your word searches and plan your research path before you get online. No matter how you are being billed, a thoughtful search strategy defined before you sign on is more likely to lead to useful results. This involves thinking about your search terms and deciding which sources to search or how to pre-filter your search.</p>
<p id="9d24283a-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is especially true when you use an online service that requires you to select a source before you execute a search. Deciding in advance which sources you plan to search will allow you to search quickly and efficiently. Searching the narrowest source that meets your research needs makes evaluating your search results easier.</p>
<p id="9d24283b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If you choose content-driven searching, you will still find it worthwhile to consider any appropriate pre-filtering criteria. Pre-filtering by jurisdiction, for example, will narrow the results of a content-driven search.</p>

Citation and subject searching are discussed in more detail in the chapters devoted to individual types of authority. This section explains techniques for effective word searching that you can use to search for many kinds of authority.</p>
<p id="9d244f59-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Effective word searching requires an understanding of the types of word searches you can conduct.

<p id="9d244f5c-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When you execute a word search, the search engine searches a database of documents and retrieves the documents that meet the criteria you set for the search. To do this, the search engine uses an algorithm, or set of rules, to evaluate the search criteria and the documents in the database. Search algorithms must balance two competing factors in retrieving results: recall and precision. Recall refers to identifying the universe of documents that meet the search criteria. Precision refers to the relevance <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="254" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-254">p. 254</span>of the results. An algorithm that emphasizes recall will retrieve many documents, not all of which may be relevant. An algorithm that emphasizes precision will focus on retrieving the most relevant results, to the exclusion of some documents that do not align as closely with the search criteria. There is no perfect relationship between these factors; each involves trade-offs. The algorithms in various search engines strike the balance differently. This is one reason why you can get different search results from the same search executed in multiple services.</p>
<p id="9d244f5d-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A literal search algorithm searches for documents that contain the specific terms in your word search. A non-literal search algorithm also searches for documents that contain the search terms, but it does not limit the result to those documents. It uses the search terms to search background information or meta-data and includes in the results documents that appear relevant to the search terms even though they do not contain those terms. Legal research services use three types of search algorithms: terms and connectors (also called Boolean), natural language, and plain language.</p>
<p id="9d244f5e-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A terms and connectors search is a literal search and emphasizes precision over recall. It identifies documents containing the precise terms you identify, in the precise relationships you request. For example, you could search for documents that contain both the phrase <i>“ice cream”</i> and the term <i>sundae.</i> Alternatively, you could search for documents that contain either the phrase <i>“ice cream”</i> or the term <i>sundae,</i> but not necessarily both. AND and OR are examples of connectors, which are the commands that define the relationships among the search terms. A list of the most commonly used commands appears in <b>Figure 10.1</b>.</p>
<p id="9d244f5f-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because you use commands to steer the search logic, you can control the search results more precisely than you can with other search algorithms. If you search for <i>“ice cream” /s sundae,</i> the search will retrieve only documents that contain the phrase “ice cream” in the same sentence as sundae; if a document contains “ice cream” and sundae but not within the same sentence, that document will not appear in the search results. The search may retrieve any number of documents, or no documents at all, depending on the number of documents that meet the search criteria. Lexis Advance, Westlaw, Bloomberg Law, and most other legal research providers offer the option of terms and connectors searching. More information on specific terms and connectors commands appears below.</p>
<p id="9d244f60-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A natural language search is also a literal search, but natural language search algorithms use embedded rules to balance recall and precision. Unlike a terms and connectors search, a natural language search does not require you to specify the relationships among the terms in the documents to be retrieved. Instead, the natural language algorithm evaluates the relationships among the search terms, which it then uses to determine which documents meet the search criteria. A natural language search for <i>ice cream sundae</i> will retrieve documents that contain all or some of those terms and will rank the results by relevance. Documents in which the terms appear frequently or close together will be ranked higher than documents that contain only one of the search terms. But because a natural language search is a literal search, recall is limited to documents that contain at least one of the search terms. Lexis Advance and Bloomberg Law offer natural language searching.</p>

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="9d24c4a9-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Your client recently ended a long-term relationship with her partner. She and her partner never participated in a formal marriage ceremony, but they had always planned to get married “someday.” They lived together for five years and referred to each other as husband and wife. Your client and her former partner orally agreed to provide support for each other, and your client’s former partner repeatedly made statements like, “What’s mine is yours.” Your client wants to know if she is entitled to part of the value of the assets her former partner acquired during their relationship or to any support payments.</p>

<p id="9d24c4aa-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One legal theory you might want to investigate in connection with this scenario is palimony, which is a claim for support made by an unmarried partner after the dissolution of a romantic relationship. It is similar to alimony granted after a divorce. If you execute a search for the term <i>palimony</i> in Florida appellate cases, the results will vary depending on the type of word search you conduct. The results of the searches are summarized in <b>Figure 10.2</b>.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10315_4737a66c-3cfa-11e8-bf95-f78ecb0bbffd" href="http://www.html-merge.com/result#note-N10315_4737a66c-3cfa-11e8-bf95-f78ecb0bbffd">2</a></span></p>

All of the searches retrieve the same five cases that contain the term <i>palimony;</i> Lexis Advance retrieves one unpublished opinion that the other services did not, and Westlaw retrieves one case that contains the term <i>palimony</i> in a West headnote rather than the case itself. Natural language searches in Lexis Advance and Bloomberg Law produce the same results. This is because the search consists of only one term, and the literal searches retrieved only documents that contain the search term.</p>

A plain language search for the term <i>palimony</i> in Westlaw retrieves 20 cases: 6 that contain the term <i>palimony</i> (and were in the Westlaw terms and connectors search results) plus 14 more that do not contain the term <i>palimony.</i> The cases are listed in <b>Figure 10.2</b>.</p>
<p id="9d25af4a-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plain language search retrieved the additional 14 cases because the meta-data they contain indicated that they met the embedded rules for relevance to the search term. Westlaw expanded the search beyond the document text to include West topics and key numbers (described in Chapter 5), KeyCite data (described in Chapter 6), and retrieval data from other users who have executed similar searches. A review of the cases in the <i>palimony</i> search results reveals that several of them share a common topic heading on informal or invalid marriage, and several of them cite or are cited by the cases that contain the term <i>palimony.</i> Westlaw used these and other criteria to connect the cases to the search term, and most of the additional 14 cases are, in fact, indirectly related to palimony. Several of them concern parties seeking property or support from a former partner or discuss doctrines that have some overlap with palimony, such as constructive trust. A few simply are not relevant.</p>
<p id="9d25d65b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When only a few documents contain your search terms, documents that do not contain the search terms but that nevertheless meet certain relevancy criteria appear in the Westlaw plain language search results. The relevance of documents that do not contain any of your search terms may be low, however, so Westlaw limits these search results to 20 documents. If more than 20 documents had contained the term <i>palimony,</i> Westlaw would not have limited the results to 20 documents. Westlaw also places some limits on the results even for documents that contain the search terms, based primarily on the documents’ relevance. The Westlaw search algorithm uses these limits to balance recall and precision.</p>
<p id="9d25d65c-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once the relevance of the documents containing the search terms gets too low, Westlaw eliminates them from the search results. Westlaw also places an outer limit on the number of documents in the search results. It will not retrieve more than 10,000 documents in any single category of authority (e.g., cases, statutes, secondary sources).</p>
<p id="9d25d65d-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A plain language search in Google Scholar retrieves the nine cases listed in <b>Figure 10.2</b>. The results include the same five cases containing the term <i>palimony</i> that the literal searches retrieved, as well as four additional cases that do not contain the search term but that contain meta-data connecting them to the search term. Google Scholar does not search the same meta-data that Westlaw does, and its coverage of state cases does not go back as far in time. This is why it retrieves fewer cases than Westlaw even though it uses a non-literal search algorithm. Google Scholar does not appear to limit the search results for cases that meet the relevancy criteria based only on meta-data.</p>
<p id="9d25d65e-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="259" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-259">p. 259</span>Which results are best? The answer depends on your research task. If you only want to retrieve cases that specifically discuss palimony, the literal search results are better suited to your task because you will not have to sort through cases that do not specifically discuss palimony. If you are interested in learning about any claims the client might bring, the non-literal search results may suit your needs better because they may point you toward other legal theories that you had not considered. In a sense, the non-literal search results mimic the results you might get if you looked up a term in a print index and used cross-references to direct you to related topics.</p>
<p id="9d25d65f-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The results in <b>Figure 10.2</b> are listed by relevance. You can see that different services ranked the relevance of the documents differently. If the results that include the term <i>palimony</i> in the court’s opinions were listed in reverse date order, they would appear as follows: <i>Posik v. Layton</i>; <i>Crossen v. Feldman</i>; <i>Gilvary v. Gilvary</i>; <i>Evans v. Wall</i>; <i>Lowry v. Lowry</i>. These differences do not matter much in a search that retrieves only a few documents, but they can matter a lot in a search that retrieves 50, 100, or 1,000 documents. This simply serves to emphasize the importance of being aware of the way the results are ordered and of treating the relevancy rankings as approximate, rather than definitive.</p>

<p id="9d25fd72-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Bloomberg Law and most other services allow you to execute a word search both as your initial search for documents and as a narrowing search within your initial search results. Although most services offer these options, this section discusses specific features of word searches in Lexis Advance and Westlaw.</p>

<p id="9d25fd75-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lexis Advance treats a search typed into the search box as a natural language search unless it includes terms and connectors commands. The Lexis Advance search algorithm errs on the side of recall over precision, which means it can return large numbers of documents.</p>
<p id="9d25fd76-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With natural language searching, Lexis Advance automatically interprets many common legal phrases as phrases. The search results will include both documents that contain the phrase as well as those that contain each individual term, but documents that contain the phrase will have higher relevancy rankings. For words that Lexis Advance does not recognize as a phrase, the search algorithm searches each term separately as an individual word. Thus, it treats a search for <i>summary judgment</i> as a phrase, while terms it does not recognize as a phrase are connected with either AND or OR, depending on how commonly the terms appear <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="260" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-260">p. 260</span>within Lexis Advance (e.g., <i>ice AND cream</i> or <i>ice OR cream</i>). You can create a search phrase by putting the search terms in quotation marks.</p>
<p id="9d262487-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although natural language searching is the default option in Lexis Advance, terms and connectors searching is also an option. Entering a search that incorporates terms and connectors search commands (such as the /P or /S connectors) will cause Lexis Advance to execute the search as a terms and connectors search. The <b>Advanced Search</b> link above the search box opens a template you can use to create a terms and connectors search.</p>
<p id="9d262488-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The default display for the search results is by relevance. You can change the default display setting using the <b>Sort by</b> options.</p>
<p id="9d262489-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once you execute your initial search, the <b>Actions</b> menu gives you choices for revising the search. You can re-run the search as either a natural language or terms and connectors search. You can also expand a natural language search to include all terms in your search, effectively applying OR as the default connector. When you expand the search this way, there is no outer limit on the number of documents retrieved, so the results may include thousands of documents, depending on your search terms.</p>
<p id="9d264b9a-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To narrow the search results, use the options in the left-hand menu.

<p id="9d264b9e-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Westlaw will ordinarily treat a search typed into the search box as a plain language search. The search algorithm recognizes many common legal phrases. If you search for a common legal phrase, the results should automatically be limited to documents containing the phrase (as opposed to documents that contain one or more of the terms separately).</p>
<p id="9d264b9f-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Placing a search phrase in quotation marks can change the way Westlaw executes the search. A search that consists of a single phrase in quotation marks (<i>“ice cream sundae”</i>) will be executed as a terms and connectors search and will retrieve only documents that contain the precise phrase.</p>
<p id="9d264ba0-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the search contains a quoted phrase with additional terms, however, Westlaw will treat the search as a plain language search and will look for the quoted terms within three words of each other. Thus, a search for <i>“ice cream sundae” and chocolate</i> will retrieve documents that contain the phrase <i>ice cream sundae,</i> as well as those that contain <i>sundae with ice cream</i>, <i>ice cream cone or sundae</i>, and so on, as long as the quoted terms are within three words of each other. Additionally, if the results include <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="261" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-261">p. 261</span>documents that do not contain the quoted phrase, you will see a message indicating that and giving you the option to limit the results to documents that contain the precise phrase.</p>
<p id="9d264ba1-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If your search does not include a quoted phrase, you still have the option to use terms and connectors searching. Entering a search that incorporates a grammatical, numerical, or exclusion connector or a term expander (see <b>Figure 10.1</b>) will automatically cause Westlaw to execute the search as a terms and connectors search. The <b>Advanced</b> link to the right of the search box brings up a template you can use to create a terms and connectors search, or you can type <i>adv:</i> followed by a search to execute it as a terms and connectors search.</p>
<p id="9d264ba2-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Search results are ranked by relevance. Once you execute your initial search, you can narrow the search results using the filtering options in the <b>View</b> menu.

<p id="9d264ba3-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You can change some of these default options.

<p id="9d2672b6-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Terms and connectors searching is useful as an initial search strategy when you want to control the relationships among the search terms. It is also the form of searching you must use when you execute a narrowing search within the initial search results. Therefore, you need to understand how to use terms and connectors searching.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead" id="9d2672b7-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d">

<p id="9d2672b9-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In terms and connectors searching, you define the relationships among the terms in the search using connectors and other commands. <b>Figure 10.1</b> lists the most commonly used commands.</p>
<p id="9d2672ba-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most searches contain several terms and may contain multiple connectors. When the search is executed, Boolean logic will process the connectors in a specific sequence. In Westlaw and Lexis Advance, the OR connector is processed first, followed by the numerical and grammatical proximity connectors (/N, /P, /S), and then the AND connector. Westlaw and Lexis Advance process an exclusion connector (AND NOT, BUT NOT) last. Bloomberg Law processes connectors from left to right, in the order they appear in the search. It is important to understand this hierarchy of connectors to create an effective search.</p>
<p id="9d2672bb-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="262" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-262">p. 262</span>If you executed a search for <i>ice AND cream OR sundae</i> in Westlaw or Lexis Advance, the search for the terms <i>cream or sundae</i> would be processed first. After documents with one or the other of those terms were identified, the search for the term <i>ice</i> would begin. In effect, the query would be processed as a search for <i>ice and cream or ice and sundae.</i> If this was not the intended search, it could miss documents containing the terms you want or retrieve irrelevant documents.</p>
<p id="9d2672bc-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are two ways to modify this search so that it searches for the phrase <i>“ice cream”</i> or the individual term <i>sundae.</i> One is by searching for <i>“ice cream”</i> as a phrase instead of connecting the words with AND. Another way to vary the search would be to segregate the <i>ice AND cream</i> portion of the search. In Westlaw, Lexis Advance, and Bloomberg Law, you can accomplish this by placing a portion of the search in parentheses: <i>(ice AND cream) OR sundae.</i> The terms within parentheses would be treated as a separate unit. Thus, the AND connector would apply only to the terms within the parentheses. In this example, adding parentheses would result in a search for the terms <i>ice AND cream</i> as a unit, and then in the alternative, for the individual term <i>sundae.</i></p>

</ul>
<p id="9d2699d3-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In developing the initial search terms, you should use the process described in Chapter 2. Think about the problem in terms of the parties, any places or things, potential claims and defenses, and the relief sought.</p>
<p id="9d2699d4-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having identified the relevant terms, your next step is expanding the search. Recall that a terms and connectors search is a literal search. If an object, idea, concept, or action is expressed in a document using terms different from your search terms, a terms and connectors search will not locate the document. Unless you are searching for terms of art that need to appear precisely for a document to be useful, you need to expand the breadth and depth of the search, as explained in Chapter 2.</p>
<p id="9d2699d5-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Expanding the breadth of the search involves generating synonyms and terms related to the initial search terms. You can also expand the breadth of an individual term by using a term expander, such as the asterisk (<b>*</b>) to substitute for individual letters and the exclamation point (<b>!</b>) to substitute for variable word endings. (Although many services use term expander characters, the functions of the characters are not standard. For example, the asterisk (<b>*</b>) in some services is used for variable word endings, not the exclamation point (<b>!</b>). You should review the search <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="263" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-263">p. 263</span>commands in any service with which you are unfamiliar.) Expanding the depth involves expressing the terms with varying degrees of abstraction.</p>
<p id="9d2699d6-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once you have developed and expanded the search terms, the next step is identifying the appropriate relationships among the terms using connectors. The closer the connections you require among the terms, the more restrictive the search will be, and the broader the connections, the more open the search will be. For example, the AND connector, which requires only that both words appear somewhere within the same document, will retrieve more documents than a proximity connector such as /P, which requires the words to appear within the same paragraph. Be sure to take the hierarchy of connectors into account as you consider the relationships among the search terms. If necessary, use parentheses to group categories of terms that you want to search together.</p>
<p id="9d2699d7-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to allowing you to search for terms within the body of a document, many services will allow you to limit your search to individual components of the document, such as words in the title or the name of the author. Although you will not always use this search option, it is an important feature to understand.</p>
<p id="9d2699d8-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Westlaw, the document components are called “fields”; in Lexis Advance they are called “segments.” In either service, you can limit your search to a particular field or segment by typing specific commands in the search box. In Westlaw and Lexis Advance, field and segment searching options also appear in the <b>Advanced</b> search template. If you open the template without selecting a source, it will display limited field and segment searching options. If you select a source to search before opening the <b>Advanced</b> template, you will see the complete list of field and segment searching options available for the source you selected.</p>
<p id="9d2699d9-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although you can make a terms and connectors search very specific by using multiple search commands, an effective terms and connectors search does not have to use all or even most of the available commands. The structure and complexity of any search will depend on the nature of the information you need. The important thing is to know what the commands are so you can use them to steer the search engine to retrieve information relevant to your research task.</p>

<p id="9d2699dc-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Regardless of the type of search you execute initially, a search within the search results in Westlaw and Lexis Advance will be a terms and connectors search. The way you draft the narrowing search will depend on how you want to filter the search results. Three ways you may want to narrow the search results include:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="9d26c0ed-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">adding terms that were not part of the initial search;</p></li>
<li><p id="9d26c0ee-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">focusing on terms that were part of the initial search;</p></li>
<li><p id="9d26c0ef-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">changing the relationships among terms that were part of the initial search.</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="9d26c0f0-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="264" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-264">p. 264</span>The results of your initial search will depend in part on the level of abstraction of your search terms. If you execute a broad search for a general concept, you will likely retrieve many documents. You may want to narrow the results by adding more specific terms. For example, the doctrine of assumption of risk is a defense to a negligence claim. If you were researching assumption of risk in the context of rock climbing accidents, you might begin your research by looking more abstractly for material related to assumption of risk in sports or recreation. If that search retrieved too many documents to be useful, you could then execute a narrowing search for authority that specifically discusses rock climbing.</p>
<p id="9d26c0f1-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To use terms and connectors commands effectively in this context, the narrowing search could include <i>“rock climbing”</i> as a search phrase. You could also search for the terms in proximity to one another with a term expander to capture variations on the word <i>climb.</i> Thus, the narrowing search might look like this: <i>rock /5 climb!</i> This search would retrieve documents in which the term <i>rock</i> appears within five words before or after any variation of the word <i>climb</i> (climb, climbs, climber, climbed, climbing).</p>
<p id="9d26c0f2-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another way to narrow the search results is by focusing on terms that were part of your initial search. If you execute a search for several alternative terms and retrieve too many documents, narrowing the search to focus on one or two specific terms will limit the search results.</p>
<p id="9d26c0f3-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A third way to narrow the search results is to use terms and connectors commands to change the relationships among the words in the search. The AND connector will limit the results by identifying documents that contain all of the specific terms instead of only one. Using the grammatical or numerical connectors (/P, /S, /N) to target documents that contain the terms close together is another good strategy. The exclusion connectors (AND NOT, BUT NOT) are useful when you have a term that is relevant when used in one context but not relevant in others. By excluding documents that contain terms associated with the irrelevant context, you can target more relevant documents.</p>

<p id="9d26c0f8-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sometimes your work on a research project will be done in a few days, but other times it will extend over a longer period of time. In law school, you might work on a moot court brief or scholarly paper for several weeks or even an entire semester. In legal practice, work on individual cases often extends over months or years. When you are working on an issue over a period of time, one resource that may be useful to you is an <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="265" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-265">p. 265</span>alert or clipping service. These services automatically run searches and notify you when relevant new information is added to a database. They allow you to stay up to date on developments affecting your research while you are working on a project.</p>
<p id="9d26c0f9-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many news services offer automatic updates on general news topics and current events. Providers of legal information also frequently offer alert or clipping services. Free services, such as Law.com, offer free daily updates on top legal stories. Fee-based services will often allow you to draft specific queries to update your research on a schedule you specify. You can specify the database(s) in which to run the search, the frequency with which the search is to be run, and the manner in which the search results will be delivered to you. Once you access the service, a menu of options will set out the choices available to you.</p>
<p id="9d26c0fa-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Westlaw offers several alert services. The two that are most likely to be of use to you in law school are KeyCite Alert and WestClip. KeyCite Alert, which is described in Chapter 6 on citators, notifies you when new information is added to the KeyCite entries for cases, statutes, federal regulations, or certain federal administrative agency decisions. WestClip allows you to draft a word search to be run periodically in the database(s) you specify and delivers the search results to you. The <b>Alerts</b> link at the top of the screen will open the menu of options for creating the search. Note, however, that WestClip works only with terms and connectors searches, not plain language searches.</p>
<p id="9d26e80b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lexis Advance also allows you to create alerts. Shepard’s Alert® is similar to KeyCite Alert and is also described in Chapter 6. It notifies you when new information is added to the Shepard’s entries for cases, statutes, or federal regulations. You can also create an alert to run a word search at specified intervals and have the results delivered to you. After you Shepardize a document or run a search, click on the bell icon and follow the menu options to create the alert.</p>

<p id="9d26e810-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Legal research used to be accomplished primarily, if not exclusively, in a limited universe of research sources produced by legal publishers. As more and more information becomes available online, however, the range of sources available for researching legal issues continues to grow. Government, educational, non-profit, trade, and civic organizations that are engaged in public education efforts make useful information on many areas of the law available on their websites. In addition, blogs are becoming an increasingly important source of information both in our <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="266" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-266">p. 266</span>culture as a whole and in legal research. Law-related blogs are sometimes called blawgs.</p>
<p id="9d26e811-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Publicly available information is most likely to be useful to you when you are looking for information on a specific topic. If you find a relevant website or blog, it may provide you with background information on the topic, references to significant legal authorities, news about legislative initiatives pending at the local, state, or federal level, and links to other sites with useful information.</p>
<p id="9d26e812-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Publicly available sources are simply new types of secondary sources. When viewed this way, their role in legal research becomes clear. The caveats described in Chapter 4, on secondary source research in more traditional legal sources, also apply to publicly available websites: Use them to obtain background information on an area of law and to obtain citations to primary authority. Do not rely on them as authoritative sources of legal rules or as official sources of primary authority.</p>
<p id="9d26e813-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To make sure you use publicly available sources appropriately, you should follow four steps: (1) locate useful information; (2) assess the credibility of the source of the information; (3) save or print a copy of the information you are using; and (4) verify and update any legal authorities you locate through the source. In the following discussion of these four steps, you will find references to websites that may be useful to you. The URLs for all these sites appear in Appendix A at the end of this text.</p>
<p id="9d26e814-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To locate useful information, you could use a general search engine, such as Google, or a specialized search engine, such as Google Scholar for scholarly publications. You can also use a directory such as Blawg, a directory of law-related blogs.</p>
<p id="9d26e815-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once you have located useful information, you must assess the credibility of the source. Anyone can post information online. Much information available online is inaccurate or out of date. Many individuals and groups post information to advance their social or policy agendas. Therefore, you need to make a separate assessment of how much weight to give to information posted on an individual’s or organization’s website. The sites you visit should contain information you can use to assess the sources’ credibility. Most sites sponsored by organizations or entities include information about the group, such as its history and mission. The authors of many blogs will provide biographical information to help you assess their expertise.</p>
<p id="9d26e816-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If you find useful information online, be sure to save or print a copy of the page. Sites can change at any moment; the information most helpful to you could change or disappear altogether at any time. If you find that information you accessed earlier is no longer available, you can try to find it in an Internet archive, such as the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, which stores copies of sites for future reference. The University of North Texas library system also hosts the Cybercemetery of Former Federal Web Sites. Although these sites provide limited historical <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="267" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-267">p. 267</span>records of websites, you cannot count on finding an archived version of a web page that has been changed, moved, or deleted. The better practice, therefore, is to save or print useful information as you locate it.</p>
<p id="9d26e817-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If you find references to legal authorities through publicly available websites, the last step is verifying and updating your research. You should not assume that the authorities you have located are correct, complete, or up to date. Use the information you have found as a springboard into more traditional avenues of legal research to make sure that you have located all pertinent information and that the legal authority you cite is authoritative.</p>

<p id="9d2b2d1e-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When you get a research assignment, you might be tempted to begin the project by jumping directly into your research to see what authority you can find. In fact, searching for authority right away is not the best way to start. Thought and planning before you begin researching will help you in several ways. You will research more efficiently if you have a coherent research plan to follow. You will also research more accurately. Searching haphazardly can cause you to miss important authorities, and nothing is more disconcerting than feeling as though you came across relevant authority by accident. Following an organized plan will help ensure that you check all the appropriate places for authority on your issue and will give you confidence that your research is correct and complete.</p>

While this might be true as far as the substance of the problem is concerned, you need to determine the scope of your project by obtaining some preliminary information from the person making the assignment. Specifically:</p>
<p id="9d2b5435-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">■ <b>HOW MUCH TIME DO I HAVE FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT?</b></p>

<p id="9d2b5438-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You should determine whether you are expected to produce a memorandum, pleading, brief, or informal report of your research results. To a certain extent, this also will be a function of the amount of time you have for the project.</p>

In practice, some clients might be unable or unwilling to pay for research completed with tools requiring additional fees, such as Lexis Advance or Westlaw.</p>
<p id="9d2b543b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">■ <b>WHICH JURISDICTION’S LAW APPLIES?</b></p>
<p id="9d2b543c-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is a question the person giving you the assignment might not be able to answer. There will be times when the controlling jurisdiction will be known. In other cases, it will be up to you to determine whether an issue is controlled by federal or state law, and if it is a question of state law, which state’s law applies.</p>

<p id="9d2b543e-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Again, the person making the assignment might not be able to answer this question. You could be asked to focus exclusively on the law of the controlling jurisdiction to answer your research question, or you could be asked specifically to research multiple jurisdictions. If either of those requirements applies to your research, you certainly want to know that before you begin your research. What is more likely, however, is that you will simply be asked to find the answer to a question. If the law of the controlling jurisdiction answers the question, you might not need to go further. If not, you will need to research nonbinding authority. Understanding the scope of the assignment will help you focus your efforts appropriately.</p>

<p id="9d2b5443-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a law school assignment, you might be expected to identify terms of art on your own. In practice, however, the person giving you the research assignment might be able to give you some background on the area of law and important terms of art to help you get started on your research.</p>
<p id="9d2b7b54-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">■ <b>SHOULD I CONSULT ANY WRITTEN MATERIALS OR INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE OFFICE BEFORE BEGINNING MY RESEARCH?</b></p>

In practice, however, reviewing briefs or memoranda on the same or a similar issue can give you a leg up on your research. In addition, another person within the office might be considered the “resident expert” on the subject and might be willing to act as a resource for you.</p>

<p id="9d2b7b5e-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The starting points for your plan are developing an initial issue statement and generating possible search terms. The issue statement does not need to be a formal statement like one that would appear at the beginning of a brief or memorandum. Rather, it should be a preliminary assessment of the problem that helps define the scope of your research. For example, an initial issue statement might say something like, “Can the plaintiff <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="274" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-274">p. 274</span>recover from the defendant for destroying her garden?” This issue statement would be incomplete in a brief or memorandum because it does not identify a specific legal question and might not contain enough information about the facts. At this point, however, you do not know which legal theory or theories might be successful, nor do you know for certain which facts are most important. What this question tells you is that you will need to research all possible claims that would support recovery.</p>
<p id="9d2b7b5f-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alternatively, you might be asked to research a narrower question such as, “Can the plaintiff recover from the defendant <i>in negligence</i> for destroying her garden?” This issue statement again might be insufficient in a brief or memorandum, but for purposes of your research plan, it gives you valuable information. Your research should be limited to liability in negligence; intentional torts or contract claims are beyond the scope of this project.</p>
<p id="9d2b7b60-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although this might seem like an exercise in the obvious, the discipline of writing a preliminary issue statement can help you focus your efforts in the right direction. If you are unable to write a preliminary issue statement, that is an indication that you are not sure about the scope of the assignment and may need to ask more questions about what you should be trying to accomplish.</p>
<p id="9d2b7b61-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once you have written your initial issue statement, you are ready to generate a list of possible search terms. Chapter 2 discusses how to do this, and the techniques described in that chapter should be employed to develop search terms in your research plan.</p>

<p id="9d2ba274-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once you have a preliminary view of the problem, the next step in creating an effective research plan is mapping out your search strategy. If you have access to a service that allows both source-driven and contentdriven searching, you must decide which approach is best for your project. Considerations affecting this assessment are discussed in Chapter 3. If you use a content-driven approach, you must decide how to pre-filter a search for multiple types of authority. If you use a source-driven approach, you need to determine which research sources are likely to have relevant information. Then, you must determine the order in which you want to research those sources.</p>
<p id="9d2ba275-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The best way to approach these tasks is to begin with what you know, identify what you do not yet know, and determine the best ways to fill in the blanks. Your goal should be to use the information you already have to begin narrowing the field of all legal information before you begin looking for authority. This will determine the level of generality at which to begin your research and set the framework for the research steps you need to follow. By answering a series of questions about your knowledge of the research issue, you can determine the best starting point for your <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="275" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-275">p. 275</span>research. <b>Figures 11.1</b> and <b>11.2</b> are flowcharts you can use to guide your inquiry and plan your research steps.</p>
<p id="9d2ba276-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For many research projects, your ultimate goal will be to produce a written document, such as a brief or memorandum, describing and applying binding primary authority relevant to the issue. If this type of authority does not exist or does not fully resolve the question, then you will probably also need to discuss nonbinding primary authority, secondary authority, or both. Although this is not what you will be asked to do in every research project, this section will illustrate the process of outlining your research path based on this goal. As you will see, this process can be adapted for other types of research projects that you might be asked to complete.</p>
<p id="9d2ba277-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The process of identifying what you know, identifying what you do not yet know, and determining how best to fill in the blanks can be applied to two components of the project: the search for binding primary authority, and the search for nonbinding authority. You might not be able to map out a complete research plan for both components of the project before beginning your research. At a minimum, however, you should try to plan your search for binding primary authority. If a search for nonbinding authority becomes necessary, you can then rework your plan to include those sources.</p>

<p id="9d2ba278-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>(1) Searching for binding primary authority</i></b></p>
<p id="9d2ba279-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Beginning with the search for binding primary authority, the flowchart in <b>Figure 11.1</b> illustrates the process you might undertake.</p>
<p id="9d2ba27a-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As you can see from the flowchart, the more you can narrow the field of legal information at the start, the further down the process you can begin. If you know nothing about the subject, you will probably need to begin by reading secondary sources, either by choosing a particular secondary source or by reviewing the secondary sources retrieved from a content-driven search. If you already have a citation to an authority on point, you can use that as a starting point.</p>
<p id="9d2ba27b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once you have a sense of the applicable legal doctrine, you may also have a sense of whether the issue is a common-law issue governed by case law or an issue to which statutes, regulations, or other types of authority might apply. You can use this information to determine the best starting point for researching individual primary authorities or filtering the results of a content-driven search.</p>
<p id="9d2ba27c-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once you have identified some binding primary authority on the issue, whether through secondary sources or some other avenue, you can use the information within individual authorities as a springboard to other primary authorities. As noted in the flowchart, for example, a case may contain headnotes that can lead you to other cases. The cases should also cite relevant statutory and regulatory provisions. Statutory annotations can lead you to legislative history, regulations, secondary sources, and cases. Of course, it is possible that the sources you consult initially will not lead you to other primary authorities. In that case, you might want to research individual primary sources independently to make sure you have located all of the relevant authority.</p>

<p id="9d2c17cd-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As you conduct your research, you might determine that you need to search for nonbinding authority to analyze your research issue thoroughly. As in your search for binding primary authority, in your search for nonbinding authority, you should begin with what you know, identify what you do not yet know, and determine the best ways to fill in the blanks.</p>
<p id="9d2c17ce-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first thing you need to know is why you are searching for nonbinding authority. Nonbinding authority can serve a variety of purposes in your analysis of a research question. Here are four common reasons why you would want to research nonbinding authority:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="9d2c17cf-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When you want to buttress an analysis largely resolved by binding primary authority.</p></li>
<li><p id="9d2c17d0-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the applicable legal rules are clearly defined by binding primary authority, but the specific factual situation has not arisen in the controlling jurisdiction. You might want to try to locate factually analogous cases from other jurisdictions.</p></li>
<li><p id="9d2c17d1-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the applicable rule is unclear and you want to make an analogy to another area of law to support your analysis.</p></li>
<li><p id="9d2c17d2-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the issue is one of first impression in the controlling jurisdiction for which no governing rule exists. In this case, you might want to find out how other jurisdictions have addressed the issue, or if no jurisdiction has faced the question, whether any commentators have analyzed the issue.</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="9d2c17d3-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In each of these situations, you might want to research nonbinding authority consisting of nonbinding primary authority from within the controlling jurisdiction, such as cases or statutes in an analogous area of law, primary authority from other jurisdictions, or secondary authority analyzing the law.</p>
<p id="9d2c17d4-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once you have determined why you need to research nonbinding authority, you should review the material you have already located. In your search for binding primary authority, you might already have identified some useful nonbinding authority. Secondary sources consulted at the beginning of your research could contain persuasive analysis or useful citations to nonbinding primary authority. Secondary sources often identify key or leading authorities in an area of law, and that might be enough to meet your needs. A citator might also have identified useful nonbinding authority. If the authorities you have already located prove sufficient, you should update your research to make sure everything you <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="278" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-278">p. 278</span>cite remains authoritative and, if appropriate, end your search for nonbinding authority.</p>
<p id="9d2c17d5-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, you might review the results of your research and determine that you need to undertake a separate search for nonbinding authority. When you first reviewed secondary sources and used citators, it might not have been with an eye toward locating nonbinding authority. Therefore, you might want to take a second pass at these sources. In addition, the nonbinding authority you ran across early in your research might not be the best material for you to cite; a more focused research effort could yield more pertinent material.</p>
<p id="9d2c17d6-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If you determine that you need to conduct a separate search for nonbinding authority, your next step will be deciding the best research path to follow. The flowchart in <b>Figure 11.2</b> illustrates several research avenues for locating nonbinding authority. Your research path will vary according to a number of factors, including the amount of time you have, the resources available to you, and the type of work product you are expected to produce. Therefore, the flowchart is intended simply to illustrate options that would be available to you, not to establish a definitive path for locating each type of authority.</p>
<p id="9d2c17d7-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One thing you might notice as you review the flowchart is that secondary sources play an important role in locating nonbinding authority. Unless you know the precise jurisdiction from which you plan to cite nonbinding authority, beginning your search for nonbinding authority in primary sources is not likely to be efficient in most cases. Secondary sources are key to determining which jurisdictions are likely to have relevant authority and which types of authority are likely to be helpful to you.</p>

<p id="9d2c3eea-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One additional decision you will need to make in formulating a research plan is whether to incorporate print research into your research plan. Most researchers gravitate toward online sources, and some libraries no longer maintain extensive print collections. For certain tasks, however, you should consider print research. Libraries continue to hold secondary sources and statutes in print because those are sources lawyers continue to find useful.</p>
<p id="9d2c3eeb-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although many secondary sources are available online, many others are not. In particular, a number of treatises are only available in print, especially those in specialized areas of law or those devoted to the law of an individual jurisdiction. If you limit yourself to the treatises available online, you may miss important sources. A trip to the library to investigate treatises will often be a good use of your research time.</p>
<p id="9d2c3eec-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Print can also offer advantages in statutory research. Although some online services provide access to statutory indexes, most do not, which means you must browse the table of contents or execute a word search to locate statutes online. The table of contents can be a cumbersome way to search unless you already know which titles or subject areas to search. Legislation is not always organized in an intuitive fashion. Further, legislation often contains terminology that might not be familiar to you. A word search that does not include the precise statutory language may not be effective. A print index, by contrast, is organized by subject and will contain cross-references that can help direct you to the correct terms or concepts.</p>

<p id="9d2c8d2b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once you have outlined your path, you are ready to begin executing your search plan. Keeping effective notes as you work is important for several reasons. It will make your research more efficient. You will know where you have already looked, so you can avoid repeating research steps unnecessarily. This is especially critical if you will be working on the project for an extended period of time or if you are working with other people in completing the research. You will also have all the information you need for proper citations. Moreover, if it happens that your project presents novel or complex questions for which there are no definitive answers, careful note taking will allow you to demonstrate that you undertook comprehensive research to try to answer those questions.</p>
<p id="9d2c8d2c-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Note taking is an individualized process, and there is no single right way to do it. Some online services will keep track of your research by collecting a list of searches you run and documents you view. You may be able to name and save a record of your searches. This is useful, but unless you conduct all of your research with a single research service, it will not be a complete record of your search process, especially if you do some research in print. You may be able to download your search history so that you can integrate information from multiple services into a single record of your own, which you can then annotate with your own notes about steps that did and did not lead to useful information.</p>
<p id="9d2c8d2d-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once you begin locating specific authorities, you will need to organize what you find. Online services may allow you to create folders for research projects. You can also create your own folders outside of any research service to collect information on your project.</p>
<p id="9d2c8d2e-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="281" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-281">p. 281</span>When you save or download documents, you may want to add notes to them. Online services may have functions that allow you to add sticky notes with notes about the document as a whole. You may also be able to highlight or mark text and append notes at particular locations within a document. You can also do these things without using a research service’s tools. Free and inexpensive sticky note software is available, and many programs have commenting functions you can use to add notes to documents.</p>
<p id="9d2c8d2f-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When you find useful information, you must decide how to organize your research, which documents or snippets to save, and what notes to add to what you have saved. You will probably want to begin by making a folder for all material related to the project as a whole. Sub-folders for research materials, your notes, and any factual documents related to the project may be useful. With respect to research materials, you may want to segregate content by issue if you are researching multiple issues or by type of authority if you are researching a single issue.</p>
<p id="9d2c8d30-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When it comes to saving documents, there is a constant tension between stopping to read what you find and saving the document for later. Most people save more than they need, and many students use collecting and saving documents as a procrastination technique, promising themselves that they will read the information later. Excessive downloading or printing will not improve your research. Certainly, having access to key authorities is important for accurate analysis, quotation, and citation. Facing a huge, disorganized collection of information, however, can be demoralizing, especially because most of the information will probably prove to be irrelevant in the end if you have not made thoughtful choices about what to save.</p>
<p id="9d2cb441-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The fact is that you will not know for certain at the beginning of your research which authorities you should save and which you should not. Only as you begin to understand the contours of the legal issue will the relevance (or irrelevance) of individual legal authorities become apparent to you. Therefore, you should conduct some research before you begin saving material. As you delve into the research, you may find that you need to go back to materials you bypassed originally. You may also find it helpful to have a “maybe” folder for your research where you can collect authorities that you are not sure will be helpful. If you do this, however, it is important to return to that information periodically to assess its usefulness.</p>
<p id="9d2cb442-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When you find information you want to save, you may be able to choose between saving the entire document or just a snippet. The benefit of saving a snippet is that you have the precise content that appears relevant.</p>
<p id="9d2cb443-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Saving snippets also presents several potential pitfalls. The passage that seemed most relevant to you at one time may not turn out to be the best part of the document upon later reflection. You also run the risk of <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="282" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-282">p. 282</span>taking a passage out of context and representing it inaccurately in your analysis. If you save only snippets, you may be tempted to use a collection of snippets pasted into a document as a substitute for synthesis of the authorities. This can also lead to inadvertent plagiarism if each snippet is not properly cited.</p>
<p id="9d2cb444-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are times when just a snippet will do, such as when only a few pages out of a lengthy document are relevant to your research. You should be cautious, however, when choosing to save only snippets of documents. Often the better practice is saving the entire document even if you do not plan to use the entire document to analyze your research question.</p>
<p id="9d2cb445-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The next step in documenting your research is deciding which notes to add to the item you save. For most items you will want to note the following information:</p>
<div class="epub-table-container"><table class="epub-table-layoutonly">



<tbody><tr class="epub-tr">
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1" class="epub-td"><p id="9d2cb446-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Citation</i></b></p></td>

Even if you use an online service that includes this information automatically when you save the document, you should note it yourself anyway so that you take account of the document’s authoritative value. Second, if you use your research in a written document, you will need this information to cite your work properly. The information you put in your research notes does not need to be in proper citation form, but enough information for a proper citation should be included here. Note that citations provided by publishers are often not in the proper format for inclusion in a legal document.</p></td>

<p id="9d2cdb64-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Deciding when your research is complete can be difficult. The more research you do, the more comfortable you will be with the process, and the more you will develop an internal sense of when a project is complete. In your first few research assignments in law school, however, you will probably feel uncertain about when to stop because you will have little prior experience to draw upon in making that decision.</p>
<p id="9d2cdb65-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One issue that affects a person’s sense of when to stop is personal work style. Some people are anxious to begin writing and therefore stop researching after they locate a few sources that seem relevant. Others put off writing by continuing to research, thinking that the answer will become apparent if they just keep looking a little bit more. Being aware of your work style will help you determine whether you have stopped too soon or are continuing your research beyond what is necessary for the assignment.</p>
<p id="9d2cdb66-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, the amount of time you have and the work product you are expected to produce will affect the ending point for your research. If you are instructed to report back in half an hour with your research results, you know when you will need to stop. In general, however, you will know that you have come full circle in your research when, after following a comprehensive research path through a variety of sources, the authorities you locate start to refer back to each other and the new sources you consult fail to reveal significant new information.</p>
<p id="9d2cdb67-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="284" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-284">p. 284</span>The fact that a few of the sources you have located appear relevant does not mean it is time to stop researching. Until you have explored other potential research avenues, you should continue your work. It might be that the authorities you initially locate will turn out to be the most relevant, but you cannot have confidence in that result until you research additional authorities. On the other hand, you can always keep looking for one more case or one more article to support your analysis, but at some point the benefit of continuing to research will be too small to justify the additional effort. It is unlikely that one magical source exists that is going to resolve your research issue. If the issue were clear, you probably would not have been asked to research it. If you developed a comprehensive research strategy and followed it until you came full circle in your research, it is probably time to stop.</p>

The two most common situations that arise are not being able to find any authority on an issue and finding an overwhelming amount of information.</p>

<p id="9d2d027d-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If you have researched several different sources and are unable to find anything, it is time to take a different approach. You should not expect the material you need to appear effortlessly, and blind alleys are inevitable if you approach a problem creatively. Nevertheless, if you find that you really cannot locate any information on an issue, consider the following possibilities:</p>
<p id="9d2d027e-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">■ <b>MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM</b></p>
<p id="9d2d027f-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One possibility is that you have misunderstood a critical aspect of the problem. If diligent research truly yields nothing, you might want to go back to the person who gave you the assignment to make sure you correctly noted all of the factual information you need and have understood the assignment correctly.</p>
<p id="9d2d0280-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">■ <b>RETHINK YOUR SEARCH TERMS</b></p>
<p id="9d2d0281-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Have you expanded the breadth and depth of your search terms? You might be researching the right concepts but not have expressed them in a way that yields useful information. Expanding your search terms will allow you to look not only more widely for information, but also <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="285" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-285">p. 285</span>more narrowly. For example, if you have searched unsuccessfully using <i>moving vehicle</i> as a search term for authority involving transportation equipment, you might need to move to more concrete terms, such as <i>automobile</i> or <i>car.</i></p>
<p id="9d2d0282-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition, you might need to rethink search terms directed to applicable legal theories. If you have focused on a theory of recovery for which you have not been able to locate authority, you might need to think about other ways to approach the problem. Try not to become so wedded to a legal theory that you pursue it to the exclusion of other viable claims or defenses.</p>
<p id="9d2d0283-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">■ <b>USE SECONDARY SOURCES</b></p>
<p id="9d2d0284-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If you did not consult secondary sources originally, you might want to take that route to find the information you need. The material on the issue might be scattered through many subject areas or statutory sections so that it is difficult to compile the relevant subset of information without secondary sources that tie disparate threads of authority together. In addition, the search terms that seemed applicable when you started your research might, in fact, not be helpful. Secondary sources can help point you in the right direction.</p>
<p id="9d2d0285-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another possibility is that you might be looking for the wrong type of authority or in the wrong jurisdiction. Although a contentdriven search will retrieve multiple types of authority, pre-filtering by the wrong jurisdiction will take you in the wrong direction. If you are using source-driven searching, you may need to look in other sources if, for example, statutes as well as cases apply to the situation. Secondary sources can help you determine what type of primary authority is likely to be relevant to the situation.</p>
<p id="9d2d0286-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, secondary sources can help you determine whether you are facing a question of first impression. If the controlling jurisdiction simply has not faced this question yet, secondary sources should direct you to jurisdictions that have. If no jurisdiction has resolved the issue, secondary sources that analyse the law might identify arguments you can make for resolving the question.</p>
</div>
<div id="9d2d0287-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="9d2d0288-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d">2.&nbsp;WHAT TO DO IF YOU FIND AN OVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF MATERIAL</p></h3></div>

<p id="9d2d0289-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The same strategies that will help you if you are unable to find any material will also help if you find an overwhelming amount of material. Making sure you understand the problem, of course, is critical. Rethinking your search terms to narrow your approach can also help. If you located information primarily using word searches, you might want to try searching by subject, and vice versa. Consulting secondary sources, however, is probably the most useful strategy. Synthesizing <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="286" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-286">p. 286</span>large amounts of authority is difficult. Secondary sources can help you identify the key authorities and otherwise limit the scope of the information on the issue.</p>
<p id="9d2d028a-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another consideration here is the scope of your research. If much of the authority you have located is secondary authority or nonbinding primary authority, you might need to refocus on binding primary authority from the controlling jurisdiction. If the controlling jurisdiction has a sufficient amount of authority for thorough analysis of the issue, you might not need to cite nonbinding authority. You might also need to narrow the scope of your research by limiting the legal theories you are considering. If some are clearly more viable than others and you already have an overwhelming amount of authority, you might want to focus on the theories that seem to provide your client with the best chances of prevailing.</p>
<p id="9d2d028b-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even when you take these steps, finding an overwhelming amount of material is not uncommon with content-driven searching. Because the results include many types of authority and because of the way the search algorithms work, it is not unusual for a content-driven search to return thousands or tens of thousands of documents. This is obviously too much information to be useful.</p>
<p id="9d2d028c-3f31-11e8-8eb0-31c3d06a930d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With content-driven searching, using the relevancy rankings and filtering the search results are critical. Although you should not assume that the very best authority will be the first item in the search results, you must rely to some extent on the relevancy rankings when a search retrieves 10,000 documents. Those at the bottom of the list are not likely to be very relevant. Post-search filtering is also important. Even when you pre-filter by jurisdiction, you may retrieve both state and related federal information or cases from all levels of court within the state. Limiting the results to the controlling tribunal or a specific publication, using a date restriction, and searching for terms within the initial results are all good strategies for focusing on the most relevant information.</p>

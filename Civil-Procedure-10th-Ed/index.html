<p id="c0581aa7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Process lies at the core of our legal system: It expresses many of our culture’s basic ideas about the meaning of fairness; it determines the victor in close cases; and it further determines which cases will be close ones. Procedure is also the area of law least understood and most maligned by lay observers. We root for underdogs and insist that rules not be stacked against them. But we are equally quick to condemn a case for having been decided on a “legal technicality,” a phrase commonly signifying that a procedural rule has come into operation.</p>
<p id="c0581aa8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A similar ambivalence pervades debate about the behavior of courts and lawyers. As a society we demonstrate a strong belief in the efficacy of lawsuits to solve social, business, and personal problems, and we extol the rule of law as a distinguishing virtue of our culture. But at the same time we worry about what many believe is an excessive willingness to seek legal solutions. The ensuing debate ranges from the role of courts in restructuring social institutions to the question of whether lawyers exacerbate disputes and waste social resources by reflexively behaving in competitive, adversarial ways.</p>
<p id="c05841b9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All these issues are procedural. Lawyers thus need to understand process as a tool of their trade, as a constitutive element of the legal system, and as a focus of debate about social values. Yet civil procedure is, by most accounts, a difficult and frustrating first-year course. Students come to law school with little experience in thinking explicitly about procedure and with an impression that cases simply arrive at the point of decision. Moreover, students sense that procedure may be the area in which lawyers’ skill counts most; the notion that meritorious cases can be lost because of bad lawyering outrages their sense of justice even as it creates anxiety.</p>
<p id="c05841ba-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This book seeks to show procedure as an essential mechanism for presenting substantive questions and as a system that itself often raises fundamental issues regarding social values. We hope that students will begin to appreciate that lawyers move the system and that, to a large extent, clients’ fates depend on the wisdom, skill, and judgment of their lawyers. Moreover, although all would agree that cases should not be decided on the basis of “mere” technicalities, fierce debate quickly arises when one tries to distinguish rules that merely direct traffic from those that guard the boundaries of fairness.</p>
<p id="c05841bb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="xxvi" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="pagexxvi">p. xxvi</span>In addition to considering such theoretical issues, the book has some practical goals. It seeks to give students a working knowledge of the procedural system and its sometimes arcane terminology. The course also introduces the techniques of statutory analysis. It should give students a better understanding of the procedural context of the decisions they read in other courses. To these ends we have tried to select cases that are factually interesting and do not involve substantive matters beyond the experience of first-year students. The problems following the cases are intended to be answerable by first-year students and to present real-life issues. Finally, the book incorporates a number of dissenting opinions to dispel the notion that most procedural disputes present clear-cut issues.</p>
<p id="c05841bc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The organization of the book adapts it to the most common sequences in contemporary procedure courses. After a brief overview of the procedural system in Chapter 1, some courses will initially consider the materials in Part I, which covers jurisdiction and choice of law. Other courses will begin with discussion of remedies, pleading, discovery, resolution without trial, identifying the trier, trial, appeal, and former adjudication, which are addressed in Part II. Part III, on joinder and complex litigation, recapitulates much of the material in Parts I and II and can be used either as a culmination of the course or as an insertion that follows pleading.</p>
<p id="c05868cd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Cases have been severely edited to eliminate citations (without indicating their omission), and they read somewhat differently from real case reports; we hope they err in the direction of smoothness. Citations are retained only when they seem significant. Footnotes have been eliminated without indication. Those that survive retain their original numbers, while the editor’s footnotes employ symbols. We have used several special citation forms: F. James, G. Hazard, and J. Leubsdorf, Civil Procedure (5th ed. 2001), is cited as James, Hazard, and Leubsdorf; C. Wright, Federal Courts (5th ed. 1994), is cited as Wright, Federal Courts; J. Moore, Federal Practice and Procedure (1969), is cited as Moore; C. Wright, A. Miller, and E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure (1969), is cited as Wright and Miller.</p>
<p id="c05868ce-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those whose assistance was acknowledged in the prefaces of earlier editions created the foundations on which this book rests. We additionally wish to thank two UCLA colleagues, Joel Feuer and Clyde Spillenger—and a former colleague, Maureen Carroll—who have gone above and beyond to help improve the tenth edition.</p>
<p id="c05868cf-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, both of us want to thank many teachers and students who have used previous editions for detailed, thoughtful, and constructive suggestions. As with past editions, this one has been greatly improved by the library staff at UCLA’s Hugh &amp; Hazel Darling Law Library, whose ingenuity is exceeded only by their helpfulness.</p>

<p id="c05dc01a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Civil procedure is a course about truth and justice—about how we define those words, how we seek the goals they express, and how we sometimes lose sight of them. It is also, inevitably, a course about greed, venality, and oppression, and the running battle waged against these fundamental human characteristics.</p>
<p id="c05dc01b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mixed with these lofty themes are the minutiae of lawyers’ work. Civil procedure is about lawyers—about their relation to their clients, to their profession, and to the courts. Most of the first year of law school concerns what lawyers call substantive law, the rules governing behavior in ordinary life: property, criminal law, torts, and contract. Everyone needs to know at least a little about these topics simply to function in the everyday world. But procedure is insiders’ law, of special importance to those administering the legal system.</p>
<p id="c05dc01c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those insiders turn to procedure to describe the rules of the elaborate game called litigation. At one level, procedure is the etiquette of ritualized battle, defining the initiation, development, and conclusion of a lawsuit. What does one have to say to get a court to pay attention? Suppose my adversary wants to invoke a court’s help—can I instead take the dispute to a different forum? From whom may a person with a grievance seek relief? What kind of relief? If I believe my adversary has information that would help me to prove my case, may I demand it of her? All these questions—involving what lawyers would call pleading, forum selection, <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="2" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page2">p. 2</span>joinder, remedies, and discovery—are dealt with in civil procedure. The answers to such questions are important to any lawyer who needs to help a client in a lawsuit. Although one might think that the underlying merits of the case are all that matters at the end of the day, procedural rulings—about where a case can be filed, whether a case can proceed to discovery, and whether a party is entitled to the discovery he seeks—can determine who wins and who loses.</p>
<p id="c05dc01d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But if procedure were only a set of rules about the etiquette of lawsuits, it would be hard to justify its place in the first-year curriculum. Another facet of procedure justifies that place: Procedure mirrors our most basic notions of fairness and the meaning of justice. If coming to a quick decision were all that mattered, we could flip coins to decide lawsuits. We don’t flip coins because solving an important dispute without reference to its merits strikes us as unjust. This bedrock principle of fairness and justice finds expression both in the details of procedural design and in several parts of the U.S. Constitution, most notably the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>
<p id="c05dc01e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Commentators, litigants, and courts do not, however, agree about what procedural mechanisms best reflect these overarching values. Some argue that our system is overly obsessed with permitting the adversarial airing of grievances. Proposed solutions range from streamlining adjudication to nonadjudicative dispute resolution. The system’s defenders argue both that the critics overstate the pathologies of modern civil litigation and that adjudication has proved to be a major force for social justice, economic growth, and political stability over the past two centuries. Such conflicting views lurk in the background at every turn of our path.</p>
<p id="c05de72f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This chapter seeks to give you some feel for procedural issues as they arise in the life cycle of a civil lawsuit. It will raise more questions than it answers, but it will offer you a sense of the course of civil litigation and a taste of the kinds of problems lawyers describe as procedural. Seeing the whole picture all at once will make more meaningful our closer investigation of these issues in the weeks to come.</p>
<p id="c05de730-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We start with a simple and plausible fact situation: Peters, a student at the University of Michigan, spent his winter vacation in Champaign, Illinois, where his parents have recently moved from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. While visiting his parents, Peters was seriously injured in an automobile accident with Dodge, a lifelong resident of Champaign and owner of a popular ice cream parlor in the town. The remainder of this chapter deals with issues that might flow from this everyday occurrence.</p>
</div>
<div id="c05de731-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c05de732-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">2.&nbsp;Clients, Lawyers, Procedure, and Strategy</p></h3></div>

<p id="c05de733-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider first whether and how this accident might enter the formal legal system. Most such episodes will never get near lawyers or courts. If Peters had adequate medical insurance and no lost wages, he might have little reason to sue Dodge. Or Dodge (or his insurer) might well offer Peters a satisfactory settlement before a suit is filed. Or Peters might want to sue but be unable to find a lawyer who would take his case.</p>
<p id="c05e0e44-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These three alternatives describe the fate of most disputes that arise in our society, with the consequence that they will never enter the official judicial system. For the rest of this book—and for the rest of law school—you will be dealing with the exceptional instances, the disputes that do find their way into court.</p>
<p id="c05e0e45-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="3" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page3">p. 3</span>What would need to happen? First, Peters would probably need to find a lawyer. (In the United States individuals can prosecute their cases themselves—<i>in pro</i>. <i>per</i>. or <i>pro se</i>, in the jargon of the law<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1006B_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N1006B_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">1</a></span>—but most consider lawyers worthwhile for litigation, in part because lawyers know their way around the procedural system.) We’ll deal later, in Chapter 5, with how people in Peters’s situation might find a lawyer; this matters a good deal, and because it does, it deserves more attention than it can get in this introduction.</p>
<p id="c05e3557-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But—even in this introduction—it bears emphasizing that the lawyer-client relationship involves <i>two</i> decisions at the outset. First, Peters, the prospective client, must locate a lawyer. For clients like Peters, that can be a bewildering process. Most individuals deal with lawyers quite infrequently, and therefore lack knowledge about what qualities to look for. Rules of professional ethics allow lawyers to advertise, but only in a limited way, and we have yet to develop a robust and reliable way of rating lawyers. So it’s likely that someone in Peters’s position would have to rely on word-of-mouth recommendations: Did a friend or relative have a lawyer she would recommend?</p>
<p id="c05e3558-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose Peters does get such a recommendation and approaches Ursula Sands, a lawyer who practices in Champaign, where the accident occurred and where Peters’s family lives. Further suppose that Sands’s practice includes the kind of case Peters contemplates (as opposed, say, to a practice limited to wills or business transactions). When he visits Sands’s office, the second decision must be made: Does Sands want to represent Peters? Experienced lawyers will tell you that the most important decision they make in a lawsuit is whether to take on a particular client. That initial decision derives its importance from the fact that professional rules prevent lawyers from simply abandoning clients if they become unhappy with the progress of the case. So Sands wants to be sure about at least two things before she takes on Peters as a client. First, she wants to know whether she can rely on his truthfulness and candor. It’s a dreadful thing for a lawyer to discover, halfway through a case, that her client has fabricated part of the story or has omitted critical facts. We will learn a bit more in Chapter 6 about an attorney’s obligation to double check her client’s claims. Second, for reasons you’ll better understand after reading Chapter 5, Sands will likely want to know whether the stakes of the case will warrant the investment it requires. In the United States today, almost all cases like Peters’s will be handled on the plaintiff’s side by a contingent fee agreement, in which the client pays nothing if the case fails but pays a percentage of any recovery to his lawyer. So Sands will care about the likely recovery in relation to the amount she will need to invest—in terms of her time and other expenses. If Peters’s only injury is a broken ankle, but the case will require multiple experts, it’s likely not worth his—or Sands’s—while to pursue it. So, to reiterate, Peters must decide if he wants to retain Sands as his lawyer, and Sands must similarly decide whether she wants to represent Peters in this matter.</p>
<p id="c05e3559-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If Peters decides to hire Sands (and Sands agrees to take Peters on as a client), Peters and Sands have to divide responsibilities. Common sense and codes of <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="4" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page4">p. 4</span>professional ethics agree that clients make major decisions about the goals of litigation. A lawyer can get disbarred if she files suit, settles a case, or refuses a settlement without consulting her client. By contrast, questions of tactics belong to the lawyer: what court to sue in, whether to request a jury trial, how to develop the facts of the case, what evidence to present in what order, and more. A lawyer should keep her client informed about these matters and would certainly explain her thinking if a client asked, but generally would not seek a client’s permission or advice concerning them. Because tactics, including procedural tactics, lie in the hands of the lawyer, the lawyer needs, besides good judgment, a good grounding in the available procedural tools. How well Sands uses these tools may, in a close case, spell the difference between victory and defeat for Peters. As you encounter cases in this course you will have two questions to answer: What principle of law determined who prevailed in this situation?; and which lawyer picked this particular fight and why—what strategic or tactical advantage was she hoping to achieve?</p>
<p id="c05e355a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having divided responsibilities between lawyer and client, the system has to decide how to handle problems that arise from this division of responsibilities. For representation to work, the legal system has to treat the lawyer’s choices as if they were Peters’s choices. In legal and economic terms Sands is Peters’s “agent,” acting for him in the lawsuit. When Peters’s lawyer does a fine job, everyone (except Dodge) is happy. But what if she doesn’t? Suppose Sands files a suit seeking recovery for personal injuries but not for damage to Peters’s car. The legal system will treat that choice as if Peters himself had made it. But what if Sands’s behavior results not from Peters’s choice but from Sands’s carelessness—forgetting to ask Peters whether his car was damaged? In that situation, the procedural system faces a dilemma. If the system lets Sands fix her mistake by later adding the claim for property damage, it will thereby harm Dodge, who may have been relying on the original claim to be a complete statement of Peters’s grievance (and thus failed to preserve evidence showing that Peters’s car was not in fact damaged). But if the procedural system insists that Peters stand by the original version of the claim—without the claim for property damage—it will thereby harm Peters, by blocking him from recovering for damage to his car.</p>
<p id="c05e5c6b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This problem has no good solution, but the system tries to solve it in three ways. The first is to make the party who made the mistake suffer: Peters can sue Sands for malpractice if her negligence has caused him to forgo part of his recovery. The second is to tell the party suffering the harm—Dodge—that the harm really isn’t so bad, and that he should suffer the expense and inconvenience of allowing Peters to fix the mistake. Finally, the system can try to wriggle out of the problem by allowing Peters to amend his claim but granting Dodge extra time to prepare a defense. Each solution has a corresponding drawback. If the system insists that Peters is bound by his lawyer’s slip—and that his only remedy is a malpractice action—it will force him to start a second lawsuit (against his lawyer), with all the attendant uncertainty, expense, and delay. (Moreover, his lawyer may not have the assets or insurance to cover his losses.) If the system allows Peters’s lawyer to cure her slip by amending the complaint, it will undermine the efficiency that flows from treating lawyers’ actions as those of their clients and will inflict the costs of Peters’s lawyer’s sloppiness on Dodge. And if it crafts a solution that hurts neither Peters nor Dodge but <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="5" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page5">p. 5</span>extends the litigation, it may inflict costs on other litigants by making them wait longer to have their cases resolved.</p>
<p id="c05e5c6c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because procedural choices have consequences for parties and other litigants, you will repeatedly encounter courts trying to resolve this trilemma. As you do, consider whether the choices they make are reasonable.</p>

<p id="c05e5c6f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If you’ve absorbed the preceding few pages, you have—even before encountering your first case or Rule or statute—learned something fundamental about the practice of law: that lawyers and clients stand in a relationship. Many layers of law and professional ethics define the lawyer-client relationship and most of them lie beyond the scope of this course. But each is assigned a role, and must have confidence that the other will do their part. The client, in choosing his lawyer, must keep in mind that the lawyer will be responsible for making tactical decisions about the litigation—including where to file the case, what evidence to seek, and how to present the claims—that could spell victory or defeat in the case. The lawyer, in accepting a case, must keep in mind that the client will have authority to accept or reject settlement offers, regardless of the attorney’s view of whether the case should go to trial. So—for <i>both</i> lawyer and client—it’s a very good idea to do some investigating and some thinking before entering the relationship.</p>

<p id="c05e8382-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once Peters has selected Ursula Sands as his lawyer, Sands will have to begin making procedural choices, each of which may have consequences for the outcome of the suit. One of the first such choices may not have occurred to you: where to file the case. The 50 states and the federal government all operate systems of courts, and Sands must find out whether she has a choice of courts. If she has a choice, she will have to decide which would be most advantageous.</p>
<p id="c05e8383-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why should Sands care in which state Peters’s case is heard? Convenience provides one possible answer: Recall that Peters is likely to return to Ann Arbor for classes, but Sands, his lawyer, operates out of Champaign. For Peters it would likely be more convenient to have the case heard in Ann Arbor, Michigan. For Sands, this may involve some headaches: If she is not licensed to practice in Michigan, she must refer the case to a lawyer who is. On the other hand, recall that Dodge is a long-established business owner in Champaign and Peters and his family are relative newcomers. A Champaign jury might be less sympathetic to Peters than to Dodge—in which case it may be worth Sands’s time to find that Ann Arbor lawyer. Moreover, convenience for Peters is likely to mean inconvenience for Dodge (or his insurer), a possibility that may not make Sands unhappy. Will an Ann Arbor jury—with perhaps a University of Michigan student or <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="6" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page6">p. 6</span>two on it—be more sympathetic to Peters? Do courts in one state or the other have large case backlogs that would delay Peters’s claim? Or maybe Sands is trying to avoid a particular judge, whom she believes to be unsympathetic or ill-tempered.</p>
<p id="c05e8384-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With a sense in mind of where she might prefer to bring suit, Sands now needs to know what the possibilities are. The rules governing where a suit can be brought come under the headings of personal jurisdiction, subject matter jurisdiction, and venue.</p>
<div id="c05eaa95-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c05eaa96-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">1.&nbsp;Personal Jurisdiction</p></h3></div>

<p id="c05eaa97-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A court in the United States cannot exercise power over a defendant—here Dodge—if doing so would “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” Out of this phrase in the U.S. Constitution<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100CF_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N100CF_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">2</a></span> the United States Supreme Court has woven an elaborate doctrinal fabric that limits the power of courts over defendants. As you will see in Chapter 2, this doctrine defines the <i>personal jurisdiction</i> of courts. To condense a great deal of law into a few words, a court cannot exercise power over Dodge unless the state in which that court sits has some connection with him or with the accident that gave rise to Peters’s claim. Because Dodge lives in Illinois and the accident occurred there, courts in Illinois would have the power to hear the case, but not a court in Texas or California—unless Dodge lived there when the suit was later filed or had some other significant connection with those states.</p>
<p id="c05ed1a9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What about Michigan, where Peters goes to school? Probably not, unless Dodge consented. The doctrine of personal jurisdiction focuses on the defendant, who is being taken to court against his will. That does not mean that defendants can only be sued in their home states—but it does mean that a state cannot enter a judgment against a defendant like Dodge who has no connection with the state. So our case is almost certain to be brought in a court in Illinois.</p>

<p id="c05ed1ac-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Assuming for now that Peters will have to bring suit in Illinois, does he have any other choices among courts available to him? Specifically, does he have his choice between a state court and a federal court? As already noted, Sands will want to choose the court that offers her client the greatest advantages—and fewest disadvantages.</p>
<p id="c05ed1ad-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All states have at least one court of general jurisdiction that could hear Peters’s state law tort claim. In Illinois that court is the circuit court, but in other states it may be called a district court, superior court, court of common pleas, or, in New York, the Supreme Court. Thus one alternative open to Peters is the Circuit Court of Illinois.</p>
<p id="c05ef8be-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sands may also be able to file Peters’s case in federal court. If she can, some additional elements enter the calculation. All federal judges are appointed for life <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="7" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page7">p. 7</span>(Article III of the U.S. Constitution permits their removal only by impeachment). Most state judges are subject to some electoral approval. That difference can be important in a case in which judicial insulation from political pressure may play a role (hardly likely in the Peters-Dodge case). Second, most federal districts are larger than their state equivalents (usually counties), so jurors will be drawn from a broader pool—not just Ann Arbor or Champaign but several surrounding counties. Consider how this fact might have affected the strategy of the plaintiffs’ lawyer in the next case, <i>Hawkins v. Masters Farms.</i></p>
<p id="c05ef8bf-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Though at this point in your study the idea may seem strange, federal courts have limited jurisdiction. Article III, §2 of the federal Constitution set the outer bounds of that jurisdiction. Within those bounds it is up to Congress to decide the precise subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts. Congress has enacted a number of statutes authorizing federal district courts (the trial courts of the federal system) to hear certain kinds of cases. The most important statutes at this point in our exploration are 28 U.S.C. §§1331 and 1332(a).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100FC_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N100FC_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">3</a></span> Read those two statutes and decide which might apply to <i>Peters v.

<p id="c05f6dfa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On December 8, 2000, Mr. Creal was killed in an automobile accident on Mineral Point Road, just south of Troy, Kansas, when his 1988 Chevrolet van collided with a New Holland tractor driven by Defendant Masters [a citizen of Kansas]. At the time of his death, Mr. Creal was living in Troy with his wife, Elizabeth Creal, and her children. He was approximately forty-four years old when he died.</p>
<p id="c05f6dfb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">James and Elizabeth Creal first met in St. Joseph, Missouri in November 1999. Mr. Creal had lived in St. Joseph for most of his life, while Mrs. Creal resided in Troy for the majority of her life. When the couple first met, Mr. Creal was living at his mother’s home in St. Joseph, where he had been residing since obtaining a divorce from his previous wife.</p>
<p id="c05f6dfc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Beginning in January 2000, Mr. Creal began spending the night at the apartment Mrs. Creal shared with her children on South Park Street in Troy. Initially, Mr. Creal would return to his mother’s house every evening after work, shower, gather some clothes, and proceed to the apartment to retire for the evening. Mrs. Creal paid the rent for the apartment on South Park Street, while Mr. Creal contributed by buying the groceries for himself, Mrs. Creal, and her two children. Mr. and Mrs. Creal split the cost of utilities for the apartment.</p>
<p id="c05f950d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When Mrs. Creal and her children moved into an apartment on 1st Street in Troy in March 2000, Mr. Creal brought his clothes, some furniture, pictures, photo albums, and other memorabilia to the new apartment. Mr. and Mrs. Creal also purchased a bedroom set for the apartment. When they moved into the apartment, Mr. Creal stopped going to his mother’s house in St. Joseph to shower and change after work, and instead came directly back to Troy to spend the night. Also at that time, Mr. and Mrs. Creal opened a joint checking account into which Mr. Creal began depositing his paychecks to help pay the household bills. Mr. and Mrs. Creal were married in July 2000.</p>
<p id="c05f950e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In November 2000, Mr. and Mrs. Creal moved into a house on Streeter Creek Road in Troy. Mr. Creal died approximately two weeks later. His death certificate lists Kansas as his residence.</p>
<p id="c05f950f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From the time Mr. and Mrs. Creal first met until Mr. Creal’s death in December 2000, Mr. Creal retained certain connections with the State of Missouri. In November 1999, he applied for a Missouri title and license for his Chevrolet van using his mother’s St. Joseph address. In December 1999, he applied for automobile insurance on the van using the same address. In March 2000, he listed the address when he took out a loan and applied for a new Missouri title on the van to name a new lien holder. In April 2000, he renewed his Missouri driver’s license for three more years under the address. In May 2000, he filled out a form for life insurance listing the address. Mr. Creal also received mail and his paycheck stubs at his mother’s house, where he <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="9" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page9">p. 9</span>stopped by every week to visit.

<p id="c05f9510-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, although Mr. and Mrs. Creal left open the possibility of leaving Troy to move to a location closer to Kansas City, Missouri, such as Platte City or Faucett, Missouri, they never looked for houses elsewhere and never made any specific plans to leave.

<p id="c05fbc22-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . The parties do not dispute that all Defendants are citizens of the State of Kansas and that Plaintiff Baldwin is a citizen of the State of Missouri. Although Plaintiff Hawkins, as an individual, is also a citizen of the State of Missouri, her role in this case as Personal Representative of the Estate of Mr. Creal mandates that the court focus on the citizenship of Mr. Creal at the time of his death, not the citizenship of Plaintiff Hawkins herself. 28 U.S.C. §1332(c)(2) (“[T]he legal representative of the estate of a decedent shall be deemed to be a citizen only of the same State as the decedent  . . . ”). Whether Mr. Creal was a citizen of the State of Kansas or the State of Missouri at the time of his death is the central dispute currently before the court.</p>
<p id="c05fbc23-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For purposes of determining whether diversity jurisdiction exists, a person is a “citizen” of the state in which he or she is “domiciled.” “For adults, domicile is established by physical presence in a place in connection with a certain state of mind concerning one’s intent to remain there.” Miss. Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, 490 U.S. 30, 48 (1989).</p>
<p id="c05fbc24-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, the court concludes that at the time of his death, Mr. Creal had not only established a physical presence in the State of Kansas, but also displayed an intent to remain there. Although Mr. Creal lived the majority of his life in St. Joseph, Missouri, he had been living in Troy, Kansas with his wife of five months for nearly one year at the time he died. Among other things, he had moved his clothes, some furniture, pictures, photo albums, and other memorabilia into the home he shared with Mrs. Creal and her children; he contributed to household costs; and he purchased a new bedroom set with his wife. Although Mr. Creal retained some connections with the State of Missouri, the court does not find these connections sufficient to overcome the evidence that his actions from January 2000 until the time of his death demonstrated an intent to remain with his wife in the State of Kansas. In fact, the only evidence presented by Plaintiffs that directly calls Mr. Creal’s intent into question is the deposition testimony of Mrs. Creal that the couple left open the possibility of leaving Troy to move to a location like Platte City or Faucett, Missouri, but that they never looked for houses there or made any specific plans to leave. At most, Mrs. Creal’s testimony evidences a “floating intention” of Mr. Creal to return to his former domicile, which is insufficient to overcome the evidence that he was domiciled in the State of Kansas at the time of his death.</p>
<p id="c05fbc25-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In conclusion, the court has considered all of the evidence and arguments presented by the parties and holds that Mr. Creal was a citizen of the State of Kansas at the time of his death.

For starters, the case talks not at all about whether the driver of the tractor was careless—a question that will surely matter if the case goes to trial. Instead, it focuses on an apparently strange question: of what state Mr. Creal was a “citizen”? That matters because a federal statute, 28 U.S.C. §1332, confers subject matter jurisdiction on federal district courts in controversies between “citizens of different states.” For over two centuries courts have interpreted that phrase in ways this short opinion elaborates.</p></li>

Conversely, if there was any doubt about the existence of federal diversity jurisdiction, why did plaintiffs (or, likely, their lawyer, who is probably working on a contingent fee basis) waste time and effort on a losing gamble when they could have been proceeding with state court litigation?</p>

But reading the depositions taken in this case offers some clues that permit speculation. The plaintiffs requested a jury trial, as is common in automobile tort cases. Troy, Kansas is the seat of Doniphan County, located in northeast Kansas; a state court jury would have been drawn from the citizens of Doniphan County. If, however, the case were brought in federal court, the jury would be drawn from a much larger population pool, one that would include a number of city-dwellers.</p>
<p id="c0611bd7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Masters, a defendant, was a long-time resident of Troy, active in civic affairs, and known to many of its residents, including Elizabeth Creal. We know that Mr. Creal was a relative newcomer. The depositions reveal some more information about Mr. Creal: His marriage to Elizabeth Creal was his fourth marriage, and he appears not to have had close relationships with his adult children from his previous marriages. Nor was he connected with the religious or civic organizations in Troy. The fatal accident occurred when Creal was returning—alone—from a solitary day spent deer hunting.</p>

<p id="c06142ed-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Then the plaintiff’s lawyer must formally notify the defendant of the suit. (It’s quite likely that informal conversations with the defendant’s insurance carrier will have suggested that a lawsuit is coming, but formal notice is necessary.) Rule 4 sets forth two basic means of notice, one inexpensive and informal, the other more expensive and formal. The inexpensive method, called waiver of service, involves mailing the defendant the complaint; if the defendant agrees to waive service the suit can proceed. The more expensive method, used if the defendant refuses to cooperate, requires the lawyer to draft a summons (an order to appear), and take it to the clerk of the court, who will sign and seal it. See Rule 4(a) and (b). The summons and complaint must then be “served”—that is, delivered to the defendant in one of the ways authorized by Rule 4—by private process servers or, in exceptional cases, a federal marshal. The expense comes because process servers require a fee for their work. See Rule 4(c). These topics are covered in more depth in Chapter 2.</p>

Ethyl Corp., 835 F.2d 479, 482 (3d Cir. 1987). Rule 11 is violated only if, at the time of signing, the signing of the document filed was objectively unreasonable under the circumstances. “The Rule does not permit the use of the ’pure heart and an empty head’ defense.” <i>Gaiardo</i>. Rather, counsel’s signature certifies the pleading is supported by a reasonable factual investigation and “a normally competent level of legal research.” Lieb v.

The prime goal of Rule 11 sanctions is deterrence of improper conduct. In this case, monetary sanctions are not necessary to deter future misconduct. Plaintiff’s counsel immediately acknowledged its error and attempted to rectify the situation by filing a charge with the EEOC and moving to place this action in civil suspense. In fact, the Complaint has been dismissed without prejudice. The Court expects that Plaintiff’s counsel has learned its lesson and will demonstrate greater diligence in future.</p>
<p id="c061b72f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Further, Rule 11 sanctions should be reserved for those exceptional circumstances where the claim asserted is patently unmeritorious or frivolous.

<p id="c062055c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judge, the defendant, and the plaintiff agreed that the complaint was defective and that it would be easy to cure the defect by filing the right piece of paper with the Commission. If the defect is so minor and so easy to cure, why did the defendant <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="16" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page16">p. 16</span>bother to file a motion for sanctions? One possibility is that the defendant hoped to collect fees for the relatively small amount of time necessary to bring the motion to dismiss. Possible, but not likely: Most judges would view such a sanctions motion as a waste of time—and think ill of the defendant’s lawyer for imposing on the court.</p>
<p id="c062055d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider another possibility. Many employment discrimination lawyers would say that the EEOC filing requirement as a precondition of suit was quite elementary, and that a lawyer unfamiliar with it was likely not familiar with this area of the law. Supposing such an assessment to be correct, consider what signals the defendant’s lawyer would be sending to the judge with this Rule 11 motion. Locate the signs in the opinion that the judge has heard those implicit signals.</p>
<p id="c062055e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite the plaintiff’s attorneys’ error, the court declines to impose sanctions. Why might that be? Note that, when Bridges’s attorneys learned of the failure to exhaust, they agreed to dismiss the complaint without prejudice on the condition that defendant did not file a motion for sanctions.</p>
<p id="c062055f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The current Rule 11(c)(2)—not in effect at the time of the <i>Bridges</i> decision—requires that a party first serve his opponent with a motion for sanctions, then give her 21 days to fix the error. Only if the error remains uncorrected is the party allowed to provide the court with a copy of the motion. Were this rule followed in <i>Bridges</i>, the court would never have known of the plaintiff’s attorneys’ failure to exhaust—assuming that the plaintiff’s lawyers withdrew the complaint within the 21 days.</p>

<p id="c0622c72-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Masters Farms</i> and in <i>Bridges</i> you have encountered references to various Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. What are these Rules? Where do they come from? How are they related to other sources of law that shape civil procedure: the Constitution, statutes, and cases?</p>
<p id="c0622c73-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Briefly put, the Rules are like statutes and the Constitution in that they state general principles rather than dealing with their application in specific instances, which is the task of courts. But the Rules differ from statutes in two important ways.</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="c0622c74-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unlike statutes, they are not directly enacted by a legislature. Instead, Congress in 1935 empowered judges to write the Rules. A statute, 28 U.S.C. §2072 (called the Rules Enabling Act), empowers the U.S. Supreme Court to promulgate “rules of practice and procedure . . . for cases in the United States district courts.”</p></li>
<li><p id="c0625385-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Also, unlike federal statutes, which can deal with any topic concerning which the Constitution allows Congress to legislate, the Rules may <i>only</i> deal with “practice and procedure.” Emphasizing this point, 28 U.S.C. §2072(b) provides, “Such rules shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.” To give a crude example, a Rule could not establish principles governing damages for breach of contract; that would be “substantive.” A Rule could, however, tell the parties how they have to go about claiming whatever damages they have suffered; Rules 8(a)(3) <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="17" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page17">p. 17</span>and 26(a)(1)(A)(iii) do just that. As you will learn in your studies this year, defining the boundary between substance (which the Rules may not regulate) and procedure (which they may) can be difficult, but Congress has made it clear that it wants the Rules to confine themselves to the latter. You will also notice that, in theory, a Rule could violate the Rules Enabling Act if it crossed the line and regulated a “substantive right”—if, for example, a Rule tried to establish the principles of contractual damages. The Supreme Court has never found such a violation, though on several occasions parties have argued that some Rule crossed this line.</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="c0625386-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The original set of Federal Rules became effective in 1938. The Supreme Court Justices did not write the original Rules themselves nor do they now serve as the primary body considering amendments to the Rules. Instead, as provided in 28 U.S.C. §§2073-2077, a series of committees, appointed by the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, do this work. A Committee on Civil Rules, consisting of judges, lawyers, and a professor or two, considers proposed amendments to the Rules. This group circulates proposed changes, holds public hearings, revises the changes in light of the hearings, and submits the results to the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice, Procedure, and Evidence, again with members from the bench and bar. The Standing Committee further considers and refines the proposed amendments, passing them in turn to the Judicial Conference of the United States. The Conference, consisting entirely of federal judges and presided over by the chief justice, is the senior administrative body of the federal courts. Its tasks include everything from judicial discipline to assigning visiting judges, approving requests for new courthouse buildings, and passing on proposed amendments to the Rules.</p>
<p id="c0625387-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the Conference approves a change, it passes the proposed Rule to the Supreme Court. With all these layers in place, it may not be surprising to learn, first, that amending a Rule takes a long time, and, second, that the Court has rarely rejected outright a Rules amendment, although on occasion individual justices have dissented from the promulgation of a proposed Rule.</p>
<p id="c0625388-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even after all these steps the proposed Rule still is not law. Under 28 U.S.C. §2074 the Court, if it too approves the proposed change, must “transmit [it] to Congress not later than May 1 of the year in which such a rule . . . is to become effective.” Congress has until December 1 to act: If it disagrees with a proposed change it can pass a statute blocking or altering the proposed Rule. Congress has only on a very few occasions blocked or amended a Rule.</p>
<p id="c0625389-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since their promulgation in 1938 the Rules have undergone a number of revisions, some minor (adding a new holiday to the list of days that do not “count” for time limits) and some major (creating the modern class action, a change that some thought came close enough to being “substantive” that it violated the Rules Enabling Act).</p>
<p id="c062538a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After a number of decades during which the Rules and the process that produced them were seen as essentially technical, recent years have seen both individual Rules and the process surrounding them become the source of controversy. Briefly put, that controversy has taken two forms. Some have criticized specific Rules as favoring one group over another. For example, some say that the recent <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="18" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page18">p. 18</span>changes in discovery rules came at the behest of repeat defendants (generally large public and private institutions) and will handicap those who more often find themselves as plaintiffs—those challenging the actions of such defendants. (We’ll explore this branch of the controversy more thoroughly in Chapter 7, on discovery.) The other form of criticism focuses on the courts, which, some charge, have interpreted Rules in ways unintended by the drafters and which, again, favor institutional defendants over plaintiffs. As examples, critics cite the U.S. Supreme Court’s recent reinterpretation (as the critics would have it) of Rule 8, governing pleading; and the same Court’s interpretation of Rule 23, governing class actions. As you will see in later chapters, these decisions raised barriers for plaintiffs that, critics say, betray the original principles behind the Rules and distort access to justice. In the pages that follow, we shall try to highlight such examples of controversy—we aim not to resolve these disputes, but to lay out their bases and sometimes point to data that would enable one to decide who has the stronger argument.</p>
<p id="c0627a9b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, one should note that the Rules have had an influence far beyond the courts for which they were written. Federal courts hear only 2 percent of the civil cases in the United States. But the model represented by the Rules—merger of law and equity, relaxed pleading, flexible joinder of claims and parties, and broad discovery—has deeply influenced the procedure of state courts. Though it was not the case in 1938, <i>every</i> state now uses a procedural model that embraces most of these principles. At one time, 30-plus states went so far as to adopt the “federal” Rules as their own procedural code. This trend has declined; as of 2003, one scholar found “no true replicas” of the Federal Rules adopted by any state, but concluded that “the federal model of civil procedure remains substantially influential at the state level.” John B. Oakley, <i>A Fresh Look at the Federal Rules in State Courts</i>, 3 Nev. L.J. 354 (2003). So when you are studying the Rules, you are studying the most influential procedural reform of the last 200 years. Note also that the states’ adoption of a Rules-model procedure makes state courts a forum for the political controversies just noted. To use just one example, when the U.S. Supreme Court interpreted Rule 8 (the pleading rule) in a way said to handicap plaintiffs, that interpretation bound all federal courts, but left state courts free to interpret their analogous rule in a different way. So when, in the coming pages, you read a federal court’s interpretation of a federal Rule, you might ponder whether you think a state should follow the same path or diverge from it.</p>

<p id="c0627a9e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Bridges</i> illustrates one facet of a lawyer’s responsibility in drafting a complaint. But even if Peters’s lawyer is entirely comfortable that the claim is well grounded in fact and in law, she must still confront the task of setting forth that claim in a formal document. What should be in a complaint? Should it contain a simple statement that Peters is suing Dodge for injuries suffered in an accident, or a detailed recitation of what each party did on the day of the accident, and a blow-by-blow account of plaintiff’s injuries and recovery? As we will explore in Chapter 6, we are now in the midst of a revived debate over that question.

<p id="c0633e06-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have thus far focused on procedural maneuvers in which the adversaries have sought to use procedural rules to gain tactical or procedural advantage. Consider the possibility that Novick Transfer’s lawyer may have outsmarted himself. Unlike <i>Hawkins v. Masters Farms</i>, Bell’s lawyer originally filed suit in a state court. The opinion tells us in passing that the very general complaint it quotes would at the time not have passed muster in Maryland state courts. But defendant, presumably seeking some tactical advantage, “removed” the case to federal court alleging that the parties were of diverse citizenship. (As you will see in Chapter 3, under some <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="21" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page21">p. 21</span>circumstances it is possible for a defendant to reject plaintiff’s original choice of a court.)

In the United States in the twenty-first century, most defendants in cases like <i>Peters v. Dodge</i> will be represented by a lawyer hired by their automobile insurer.</p>
<p id="c063b347-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Liability policies typically contain two promises—that the insurer will pay damages (up to the amount of the policy limits) <i>and</i> that the insurer will provide a <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="22" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page22">p. 22</span>legal defense. Dodge will have notified his insurer immediately after the accident (liability policies require prompt notification of accidents so the insurer’s staff can gather information with which to defend against possible claims). When Dodge is served with the complaint, he may be upset that he’s being sued, but he’ll again contact his insurer, who will inform him that the insurer will provide a lawyer. The insurer will then contact a local lawyer, with whom the insurer likely has a standing arrangement, giving the lawyer any information already in the file. The lawyer will contact Dodge directly and proceed from there with Dodge as her client. The relationship between Dodge and his attorney will mirror that between Peters and his attorney, with one important exception. Almost all liability policies give the insurer—not the insured—authority to settle the case. So an insurer could decide that Peters’s claim was strong and pay him the damages he demanded (or whatever smaller sum was agreed on), even if Dodge vehemently denied any liability. Conversely, even if Dodge wanted his insurer to enter into a quick settlement so he could focus all his attention on his ice cream shop, the insurer could decide to contest liability and litigate.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN104A9_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N104A9_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">4</a></span></p>
<p id="c063da59-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Assume that Dodge and his insurer do not want to settle, at least at this stage. How does Dodge’s lawyer proceed? Her first procedural task is to respond to the complaint. Although it would be possible to have a system in which a defendant was not required to do anything until trial, both the Federal Rules and state codes of procedure require some response by the defendant. Generally, that response takes one of two forms: a <i>motion</i> attacking the complaint in some way or a pleading responding to the allegations in the complaint (usually called an <i>answer</i>).</p>

<p id="c063da5c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Motions</i> is lawyer-talk for requests that a court do something; lawyers speak of “moving” or of “making a motion” to have the court take some step—dismiss the case, require an adversary to disclose certain information, enter judgment on a verdict, and so on. At the early stages of litigation, there are several motions that a defendant may make to end the case or to alter its shape, set out in Rule 12(b).</p>
<p id="c063da5d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There may be reasons, having nothing to do with the merits of the claim, why a case should be dismissed. These reasons typically relate to the court in which the action is brought or the method by which the defendant was brought into that court. For example, the defendant may contend that the case should be dismissed because it does not belong in federal court (subject matter jurisdiction); such a motion prompted the decision in <i>Hawkins v. Masters Farms</i>, the first case in this chapter. See Rule 12(b)(1).</p>
<p id="c063da5e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="23" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page23">p. 23</span>The defendant may also say that, even if everything in the complaint is true, under the substantive law plaintiff has no right to relief. An obvious if unrealistic example is a complaint that alleges that the defendant made a face at the plaintiff or that the defendant drove a car of an offensive color. At common law, the defendant would <i>demur</i> to such claims; now we say that the defendant moves to dismiss on the ground that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. See Rule 12(b)(6). The opinion you read in <i>Bell v. Novick Transfer</i> was written in response to the defendant’s Rule 12(b)(6) motion.</p>
<p id="c063da5f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notice an important characteristic of these pre-answer motions: <i>They take no position on the truth or falsity of plaintiff’s factual allegations</i> (for example, that Dodge was driving negligently). That, as you will see in a moment, is the job of the answer.</p>

It has become common for motions to be decided without any oral hearing—“on the papers.” In that event the judge will simply issue a ruling. If there is a hearing, the judge will typically have read the motion papers beforehand. The judge will either hear oral argument from the lawyers or ask them questions about any aspects of the case not clear from the papers. She may decide the motion on the spot or she may reserve her ruling, making it after additional thought or research. Sometimes a judge will issue a tentative ruling based on the papers, which is given to the lawyers when they arrive for the hearing. The judge then allows the losing party to argue against the tentative ruling.</p></li>

<p id="c0644f9a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In contrast to a pre-answer motion, an <i>answer</i>, as the name suggests, does respond to the allegations of the complaint, paragraph by paragraph. There are only two essential variations on the answer:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-decimal">
<li class=""><p id="c0644f9b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the most common response to a complaint, the defendant denies the truth of one or more of the allegations of the complaint, or, if after reasonable investigation the defendant does not know whether an allegation is true, he may deny the allegation. See Rule 8(b). (At common law, this move was called a <i>traverse</i><span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10530_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10530_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">5</a></span>; today it’s a <i>denial</i>.) The defendant will also likely admit some of the facts in the complaint, for example, the day the accident occurred, or the citizenship of the parties.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0644f9d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant may want to assert defenses that will wholly or partially defeat plaintiff’s claim. For example, the defendant may contend that the applicable statute of limitations has run or that the plaintiff has released her claim. At common law, such matters were called <i>confession and avoidance</i>; today we call them <i>affirmative defenses</i>. See Rule 8(c).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0644f9e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant may also wish to assert a claim against the plaintiff that would entitle him to relief. These are called <i>counterclaims</i>. See Rule 13.</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="c0644f9f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Turning to Peters’s case, let us suppose that Dodge’s attorney decides there is no question relating to personal jurisdiction and that there are no problems with notice or service of process. On the other hand, Dodge may very well believe that the federal court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over the claim because the parties are not diverse (as in <i>Hawkins</i>). Dodge probably will want to deny certain allegations of the complaint, such as the allegation that he was negligent. He also may want to allege various affirmative defenses to Peters’s claims. For example, in such a case it is quite common for a defendant to claim that the plaintiff’s contributory negligence was, at least in part, the cause of the accident. Such contributory negligence will act as a complete or partial defense to recovery. And, if Dodge was injured or his vehicle damaged in the accident, he will want to assert a counterclaim<i>,</i> alleging Peters’s negligence caused injuries to Dodge, which could enable Dodge to get compensation for his injuries and property damage. Indeed, as you will discover in Chapter 12, if Dodge has a counterclaim arising from the accident, he <i>must</i> assert it in his answer, or lose it.</p>

<p id="c0653a21-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In discussing complaints and answers, we have been speaking of what the Rules call “pleadings”; Rule 7(a) contains a complete list. The Federal Rules reject the view that the case is set in stone once the pleadings are completed. Instead, the Rules reflect a liberal policy toward changes (called <i>amendments</i>) to the pleadings. The discovery rules, which enable parties to gather information about the case, would mean little if new information could not be reflected in amended pleadings. For example, the <i>Peters v. Dodge</i> complaint assumes that Dodge was both the owner and driver of the vehicle. Discovery might reveal that Dodge’s daughter holds title to the vehicle (suppose Dodge bought the car as a graduation present for the daughter, but was borrowing it for the day while his own car was in the shop). Under the substantive law, owners of a vehicle are liable for accidents negligently caused by a permissive driver. Having learned of this circumstance, Peters’s lawyer could seek to amend the complaint to add Dodge’s daughter as a defendant.</p>
<p id="c0653a22-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 15(a) sets forth the basic amendment rules and states that “[t]he court should freely give leave [to amend] when justice so requires.” What this seemingly simple phrase means is open to interpretation, as we will see in Chapter 6. Rule 15(c) deals with amendments that add a new claim or party after the statute of limitations has run.</p>

<p id="c065884d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This action involves claims brought by five individual plaintiffs who own property in or around Washington County, Alabama alleging diminution in value to their real estate caused by environmental contamination from a nearby chemical manufacturing facility . . . owned at various times by defendants. Plaintiffs contend that their properties are contaminated by DDT emanating from Ciba’s McIntosh plant. . . . </p>
<p id="c065884e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On April 27, 2007, defendants filed a Motion to Sever pursuant to Rules 20 and 21, Fed. R. Civ. P., seeking to splinter the trial of these proceedings (which is slated for the August 2007 trial term) into five separate trials, one for each plaintiff. Defendants ground their Motion on assertions that a common trial would be inefficient and prejudicial. Plaintiffs oppose the Motion, arguing that severing the plaintiffs’ essentially identical claims would effect great inefficiency, undue delay and undue expense, while also burdening the Court with presiding over a largely similar trial five times in a row.</p>

<p id="c065af64-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants articulate four different grounds for their contention that severance of each plaintiff’s claims from each other plaintiff’s claims for trial purposes is appropriate. In particular, defendants argue that (i) plaintiffs’ claims do not arise from the same transaction or occurrence; (ii) plaintiffs will rely on individualized evidence to prove their claims; (iii) defendants will invoke individual-specific defenses; and (iv) a common trial will be prejudicial to defendants.</p>
<p id="c065af65-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first three of defendants’ contentions logically should be considered together, because they all are fundamentally challenges to the efficiency of trying all five plaintiffs’ claims in a single trial. . . . </p>
<p id="c065af66-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plainly, to conduct a single joint trial would be a strategy marked by both efficiencies, inasmuch as the issues of common proof need only be presented and decided once, and inefficiencies, inasmuch as there will be a certain degree of unique evidence and argument as to each plaintiff’s claims that is not germane to the other plaintiffs’ claims. . . . After careful consideration of the respective arguments of counsel, the Court is persuaded that, while neither approach is optimal, the interests of efficiency would be best served by keeping the plaintiffs’ claims together for trial in their present consolidated posture. The Court anticipates that there will be substantial overlapping background evidence for all plaintiffs’ claims concerning the environmental history and activities of the Ciba plant, and the interactions of Ciba with the media, government regulators, and alleged co-conspirators. Moreover, plaintiffs have argued, and defendants have not disputed, that it is probable that the same roster of nine expert witnesses (three for plaintiffs and six for defendants), all of whom live out of state, will be called to testify with respect to each plaintiff’s claims. To require these nine experts (not to mention counsel, many of whom live in Texas and Louisiana) to travel to Mobile, Alabama five times in quick succession (or to sit and wait in a hotel for days on end) to testify in five different trials would be financially foolhardy and needlessly wasteful of the parties’ economic resources, potentially even rendering these trials cost-prohibitive.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN106C9_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N106C9_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">6</a></span> Moreover, if these nine experts would be testifying to substantially similar, partially overlapping opinions in each of these five trials, the attendant drag on the efficient administration of justice would be considerable, as this Court would be subjected to something akin to a judicial <i>Groundhog Day.</i> Under the specific circumstances of this case, it appears far preferable from a judicial economy standpoint to hear all of the evidence once, including both common and plaintiff-specific facts, in a single trial proceeding than to hear the common evidence five times, with plaintiff-specific testimony being confined to <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="30" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page30">p. 30</span>each plaintiff’s individual trial. Accordingly, the Court finds that considerations of efficiency and delay do not militate in favor of severance.</p>
<p id="c065d678-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants also maintain that a joint trial would be “extremely prejudicial” to them. This objection is apparently threefold, to-wit: (a) a multiplicity of plaintiff-specific facts will confuse the jury; (b) to the extent that one plaintiff’s claims are stronger than the others’, evidence as to that plaintiff may unfairly taint the jury as to the other plaintiffs’ claims; and (c) consolidation for trial will allow plaintiffs to “bolster [ ] their individually weak cases by a suggestion that contamination is widespread.” None of these considerations are persuasive. . . . Federal juries are routinely asked to parse facts that are relevant to particular claims or particular parties, and are able to do so without difficulty so long as counsel presents the evidence in a cogent, orderly fashion that makes clear which evidence attaches to which particular claims or defenses. Furthermore, defendants’ “taint” argument disregards the ready availability of limiting instructions (should counsel draft and propose same) . . . as well as pattern charges stressing that the claims and defenses of each party must be considered separately and independently from those of each other party. There is no reason to believe that a jury would be unwilling or unable to follow such instructions in this case; therefore, defendants’ protestations of prejudice are misplaced.</p>
<p id="c065d679-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, as for defendants’ stated concern that the joinder of plaintiffs’ claims in one trial might give rise to a suggestion that contamination from the Ciba plaint is widespread, the Court fully anticipates that plaintiffs’ evidence—whether presented in one trial or five trials—will be that the alleged contamination is, in fact, widespread. Thus, this “suggestion” will be before the jury in plaintiffs’ evidentiary submission at trial, irrespective of whether severance is granted.</p>
<p id="c065d67a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In short, the Court finds that defendants have failed to make a showing of prejudice sufficient to justify the heavy burden that would be visited on the litigants and this Court alike by virtue of the proposed fragmentation of the plaintiffs’ claims into five overlapping trials.</p>

<p id="c065fd94-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether five plaintiffs can bring their claims against defendants in one case or must file five separate lawsuits may seem mundane, akin to the question of whether to drive separate cars to a restaurant or carpool. Either way, one may assume, each of the plaintiffs are equally likely to have their day in court. Yet this may not be so. Note that it would cost $3,000 to have the plaintiffs’ experts testify at one trial; five trials would raise the experts’ expenses to $15,000. Note also that four of the five plaintiffs’ properties at issue in the case are valued at less than $3,000. So a decision to sever the cases might well mean that it would be prohibitively expensive for four of the five plaintiffs to proceed to trial. Now consider the defendants’ perspective on joinder. Presumably, these cost considerations are among the very reasons defendants oppose joinder. Additionally, defending against five plaintiffs with similar claims of environmental contamination would be far more challenging than addressing the cases one by one; particularly if, as the opinion suggests, defendants believe some of the plaintiffs’ claims are stronger than others.</p>
<p id="c065fd95-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 20 gives you just a taste of the possibilities and problems created by joinder of parties. For now it is enough to understand that broad joinder of parties is one of the distinctive marks of modern civil procedure. You will get a much more comprehensive view of joinder in Chapter 12.</p>

<p id="c065fd98-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If relaxed pleading and broad joinder comprise two foundational characteristics of modern procedure, the third would be extensive discovery. Questions of jurisdiction, pleading, and parties typically arise at what may be called the “pleading stage” of a lawsuit, so called because most of the questions emerge in the process of drafting or challenging complaints or answers. During discovery, parties seek out facts to support or deny their usually contradictory allegations about what happened.</p>
<p id="c065fd99-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Do not equate “discovery,” the legal machinery for unearthing information that comes after the pleading stage, with fact investigation. Before drafting a complaint or answer, the parties must do some investigation regarding the facts underlying the suit. Lawyers can gather those facts in any of the ways in which ordinary citizens, unaided by official sanction, find out about things—through observation, personal knowledge, conversations with anyone who will talk to them, Internet searches, and public records requests. (Ethical rules do, though, prevent lawyers from speaking with people represented by counsel without their lawyer present.) Before the Federal Rules there was limited provision for discovery, and so factual development largely came about through these types of informal efforts by the parties. Much of it still does. This type of factual investigation is not set out in the Rules, and is consequently often overlooked in Civil Procedure courses. Let us take a moment to consider its benefits and limitations.</p>
<p id="c065fd9a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="32" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page32">p. 32</span>For example, in the Peters-Dodge case, assume that one of the issues in the suit is the seriousness of Peters’s injuries. Peters has been active on his college’s basketball team and claims that he cannot play for at least the remainder of the season. Upton (Dodge’s counsel) can speak to coaches and the athletic department about Peters’s performance pre-accident and post-accident, if they are willing to speak with her. She can search for online evidence of Peters’s participation in basketball games—including whatever he might post about himself on social media. And she might be able to hire a photographer to stand on the edge of the court where Peters’s team practices. But she would run afoul of the law were she to tap his telephone or install hidden cameras in his dorm room.</p>
<p id="c065fd9b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In many cases, however, private inquiry by the parties simply won’t uncover key information. For example, neither Peters nor Dodge is likely to voluntarily provide information to opposing counsel, and Dodge’s likelihood of obtaining information from witnesses aligned with Peters—his parents, friends, or coach—is low. Even more neutral witnesses may be reluctant to become involved in litigation or to produce information without legal compulsion. Accordingly, the Rules provide mechanisms for a party to obtain information about the case both from other parties in the case and from third parties not in the case. These rules are grouped under the heading of <i>discovery</i>.</p>
<p id="c065fd9c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The discovery rules are a major innovation of modern procedure (though they have antecedents in earlier practices). They are also a source of much dispute, both among the parties seeking and resisting discovery and among commentators debating whether the effort and expense involved in discovery yields real returns to the parties, the judicial system, or society at large.</p>
<p id="c065fd9d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rules 26-37 and 45 give parties broad powers of investigation, backed by court-imposed sanctions. Rule 26(a)(1) requires a party, without being asked, to disclose certain basic information supporting that party’s claims or defenses—names of witnesses, the existence of documents, bases for damage calculations, and the like.</p>
<p id="c06624ae-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Beyond these <i>disclosures</i>, the parties may seek additional information through several means: asking written questions (<i>interrogatories</i>) of parties to the suit (Rule 33); requiring the production of records from parties to the suit (Rule 34) and from others (Rule 45(a)(1)(A)(iii)); asking parties and witnesses oral questions under oath (<i>depositions</i>) (Rules 30 and 45); and compelling physical or mental examinations (Rule 35).</p>
<p id="c06624af-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notice that a party to a civil lawsuit may be compelled to provide the other side with information that weakens his claim or defense; not surprisingly, parties are often reluctant to produce such information and often try to use procedural tools to avoid doing so.</p>
<p id="c06624b0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Three restrictions limit the otherwise broad powers of civil discovery. First, parties may discover only evidence that is <i>relevant</i> to a claim or defense in the case and <i>proportional</i> to the needs of the case. Rule 26(b). Second, even if relevant, the requested information may be protected if <i>privileged</i>. Rule 26(b). For example, the privilege against self-incrimination, and attorney-client and doctor-patient privileges, may bar discovery even of relevant information. Third, even relevant, unprivileged information may be undiscoverable if a party can convince a court that one of the limitations in Rules 26(b)(2)(C) or 26(c) applies; if, for example, the discovery sought is “unreasonably cumulative or duplicative,” or its potential for “annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense” outweighs its evidentiary value.</p>

One bit of background may be helpful before reading the next case. In addition to federal district judges, Congress has provided for the appointment of a group of magistrate judges to assist district court judges in their work. District court judges typically assign magistrates to resolve discovery disputes, oversee settlement, and do other tasks described as “non-dispositive” (meaning rulings that will not, in themselves, end a case). Magistrate Judge Carman was referred the defendant’s motion to compel discovery in <i>Gordon v. T.G.R. Logistics, Inc.</i>, and issued the order that follows.</p>

<p id="c0664bd1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The courts have a long history of attempting to define the proper scope of discovery. The federal discovery rules were initially adopted in 1938 and have been described as a striking and imaginative departure from tradition. In the 1980s it became apparent that excessive discovery was becoming a problem. . . . With the amendments of the Rules beginning in 1983, the issue of proportionality was introduced into the scope of discovery evaluations.</p>
<p id="c0664bd2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This effort to properly limit the scope of discovery comes at a time when the amount of available data for discovery is growing exponentially. More data has been created in the last two years than in the entire previous history of the human race and the amount of data is predicted to grow 10-fold by 2020. A great deal of that data will involve social media.</p>
<p id="c0664bd3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Social media presents some unique challenges to courts in their efforts to determine the proper scope of discovery of relevant information and maintaining proportionality. While it is conceivable that almost any post to social media will provide some relevant information concerning a person’s physical and/or emotional health, it also has the potential to disclose more information than has historically occurred in civil litigation. While we can debate the wisdom of individuals posting information which has historically been considered private, we must recognize people are providing a great deal of personal information publicly to a very loosely defined group of “friends,” or even the entire public internet. People have always shared thoughts and feelings, but typically not in such a permanent and easily retrievable format. No court would have allowed unlimited depositions of every friend, social acquaintance, co-employee or relative of a plaintiff to inquire as to all disclosures, conversations or observations. Now far more reliable disclosures can be obtained with a simple download of a social media history. A few clicks on the computer and you shortly have what can consist of hundreds of pages of recorded postings and conversations of a party. There can be little doubt that within those postings there will be information which is relevant to some issue in the litigation. It is equally clear that much of the information will be irrelevant.</p>
<p id="c0664bd4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Just because the information can be retrieved quickly and inexpensively does not resolve the issue. Discovery can be burdensome even as it is inexpensive. Courts have long denied discovery of information which was easy to obtain, but which was not discoverable. “The court may, for good cause, issue an order to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c)(1). Upon a finding of good cause a court may prohibit the production of relevant information. The recent inclusion of proportionality within Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1) further emphasizes this point.</p>
<p id="c06672e5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Defendant correctly observes that there would be very little time or expense involved in the initial production of Plaintiff’s Facebook history. That’s true on the front end. The problem is that such vast information has the potential to generate additional discovery or impact trial testimony. It’s not difficult to imagine a plaintiff being required to explain every statement contained within a lengthy Facebook history in which he or she expressed some degree of angst or emotional distress or discussing life events which could be conceived to cause emotional upset, but which is extremely personal and embarrassing. . . . That being said, Defendant has a legitimate interest in discovery which is important to the claims and damages it is being asked <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="35" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page35">p. 35</span>to pay. Information in social media which reveals that the plaintiff is lying or exaggerating his or her injuries should not be protected from disclosure. . . . </p>
<p id="c06672e6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant, in apparent recognition that its initial request was overly broad, has offered to limit its request for social media temporally for three years prior to the motor vehicle accident to present. Defendant asserts that it will be unable to defend Plaintiff’s damage claims without access to information regarding Plaintiff’s emotional state prior to the accident. In this Court’s opinion that is casting the net too wide. . . . From what has been presented this case is . . . [a] “garden variety” emotion[al] distress claim. . . . Granting access to Plaintiff’s entire Facebook history would provide minimal relevant information while exposing substantial irrelevant information. As such the discovery would exceed the proper limits of proportionality.</p>
<p id="c06672e7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Defendant’s claim that it would be unable to challenge Plaintiff’s damage claims is exaggerated. Defendants have been effectively defending such garden variety emotional distress claims for many years and such claims typically make up a small part of the damages in physical injury cases. The Plaintiff also alleges a traumatic brain injury. Such damages have long been a subject of the evaluation and diagnosis by experts using proven testing protocols. . . . Therefore the Court will deny Defendant’s request for social media discovery prior to the date of the accident of June 28, 2015. Nevertheless, the Court is not convinced that all relevant social media subsequent to that date has been produced. The Plaintiff will be required to produce all relevant history which addresses Plaintiff’s significant emotional turmoil, any mental disability or ability, or relate significant events which could reasonably be expected to result in emotional distress.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN107F4_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N107F4_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">1</a></span> Plaintiff will also be required to produce all Facebook postings which reference the accident, its aftermath, and any of her physical injuries related thereto, insofar as such has not already been produced by Plaintiff. In its reply brief Defendant discusses the impact of Plaintiff’s injuries on activities she enjoyed before the accident. The Court has not been provided any guidance as to what activities of the Plaintiff may have been impacted by this accident. The Court will order the production of Facebook history and photos which relate or show the Plaintiff’s level of activity after the accident.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0669a06-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Note the ways in which the scope of the discovery at issue shifts during the course of the litigation. The defendant initially sought plaintiff’s entire Facebook account history. Then, during the discovery dispute, the defendant offered to limit its request to three years prior to the motor vehicle accident. Finally, the court’s order to compel requires production of all Facebook history and photos on or after the date of the accident that relate to the accident and her resulting injuries, or describe any other emotional turmoil, mental disability, emotionally distressing events, or physical activities. Courts have great discretion to adjust the scope of discovery requests as a means of achieving a just outcome.</p></li>

<p id="c066c11d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Imagine that the <i>Peters v. Dodge</i> case survives the pleading stage and the parties engage in discovery. After submitting document requests and taking depositions of witnesses and each other, the parties gather all of the information that they can about the underlying facts of the case. There is, then, another opportunity for a court to decide whether the case should proceed to trial: <i>summary judgment.</i></p>
<p id="c066c11e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 56(a) requires that a court should grant summary judgment when there is “no genuine dispute as to any material fact.”</p>
<p id="c066c11f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What does that mean? Suppose in <i>Peters v. Dodge</i> that Dodge moves for summary judgment and asserts that the collision occurred at the intersection of Main and Walnut Streets, and that the light was green for Walnut traffic (Dodge’s street) and red for Main traffic, where Peters was driving. To support the motion, Dodge submits his own affidavit stating that the Walnut light was green and submits the affidavit of a truck driver who was immediately behind Peters on Main saying that the light on Main was red. On this showing, with no evidence to the contrary offered by Peters, most courts would grant summary judgment for Dodge. There is no dispute that Dodge’s light was green and Peters’s light was red. No reasonable jury could conclude, given these facts, that Dodge was in the wrong.</p>
<p id="c066c120-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What if, instead, Peters submitted his own affidavit in opposition stating that he had the green light? At that point we have a factual issue for trial: Who was accurately perceiving and telling the truth about the traffic lights? In such a situation, a court would deny Dodge’s motion for summary judgment. The court would reason that summary judgment is not for weighing evidence but for determining whether there is any evidence to weigh; the conflicting affidavits would establish that there was an issue for trial.</p>
<p id="c066c121-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sometimes, however, it is not as easy to tell whether there is a genuine factual dispute.

His wife, Alice Houchens, is trying to collect upon either of two life insurance policies issued by American, which covered Mr. Houchens. One policy was an occupational accidental injury and death insurance policy. The other policy was a non-occupational accident insurance policy. . . . Both policies required that the insured’s death be caused by accident in order to be covered.</p>

The term “accident” is not defined in the policies. In such cases, the courts of Virginia have said that an accident is an “event that takes place without one’s foresight or expectation; an undesigned, sudden, and unexpected event.” Harris v. Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co., 222 Va. 45, 46 (1981) (quoting Ocean Accident &amp; Guaranty Corp. v. Glover, 165 Va. 283, 285 (1935)).</p>

<p id="c0670f56-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mrs. Houchens asserts that the presumption that Mr. Houchens is dead somehow translates into the presumption that he died accidentally; therefore, she made a sufficient showing. She relies upon three cases from the western part of the country as support for the fact that she met her burden. [The court described these cases—<i>Martin, Englehart</i>, and <i>Valley National</i>.]</p>
<p id="c0670f57-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These three cases are readily distinguishable from the case at bar. Here, there is only evidence of a disappearance. Mr. Houchens went to Bangkok and was never heard from again. There are no bizarre circumstances surrounding his disappearance. He was not last seen in a position of peril as in <i>Martin</i>. He simply vanished. The circumstances surrounding his disappearance do not give us a clue that he actually died, as did the circumstances in <i>Martin, Englehart</i>, and <i>Valley National</i>. Viewed in the light most favorable to Mrs. Houchens, we can only conclude that Mr. Houchens disappeared, and then presume that he died under Virginia law. We cannot conclude that he died accidentally. . . . </p>

Mr. Houchens might have died accidentally. However, it is equally likely that he was murdered, that he died of natural causes, that he took his own life, or that he just went away somewhere and lives yet. “It is our function . . . to ascertain whether the evidence, considered in the light most favorable toward plaintiff affords room for men of reasonable minds to conclude that there is a greater probability that the ultimate fact did happen than that it did not happen.” [quoting one of the distinguishable cases]. The ultimate fact at issue here is whether the death occurred by accident. We cannot conclude that there is a greater probability that the death was caused by accident than by other means.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0675c87-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose Mrs. Houchens produced a witness, a former college friend of Mr. Houchens who had not seen him for more than ten years.

<li class=""><p id="c0675c88-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What if, in response to Mrs. Houchens’s production of the witness above, the insurance company comes forward with two affidavits, from two Thai government officials, stating that Mr. Houchens was shot and killed by Thai police when they intercepted a drug smuggling effort. (Assume that such a death would not be accidental, as the Virginia courts define that term.) In support of these affidavits, the Thai officials state that they are prepared to produce Mr. Houchens’s passport. The judge is then faced with conflicting affidavits—one from the near-sighted former roommate, the other from Thai government officials. Summary judgment for the insurer?</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0675c8b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One aspect of <i>Houchens</i> having nothing to do with summary judgment may have puzzled you: The case is heard in federal court, but the court mostly discusses Virginia law (and that of other states); why not federal law? The answer, as you will see in Chapter 4, is that in <i>Erie Railroad v. Tompkins</i>, a leading constitutional opinion, the Supreme Court held that in a case that is in federal court only because of diversity jurisdiction, state <i>substantive</i> law applies. According to this line of cases, Virginia substantive law, including such matters as presumptions of death, governs. The law of other states comes into the picture because the federal court apparently believes that Virginia courts would look to them as persuasive, though not binding, authority.</p></li>

<p id="c0675c8c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are other methods of pretrial disposition that should be briefly mentioned here. In some cases, defendant will fail to answer the complaint entirely, or will otherwise fail to defend, and a <i>default judgment</i> will be granted. See Rule 55. Similarly, if plaintiff does not obey an order of the court during the proceedings, a <i>dismissal</i> may be granted. The most common reasons for dismissal are persistent failure to comply with discovery orders, failure to prosecute the case, and failure to appear for calendar calls, motions, or pretrial conferences. See Rule 41(b). In addition, plaintiff may seek a so-called <i>voluntary dismissal</i> of the case if the case settles or, for some reason, he thinks that he would be better off starting over. See Rule 41(a). We discuss these matters in more detail later; for now, you simply should be aware of their existence.</p>

<p id="c067839f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All pretrial activities, from pleading through summary judgment, anticipate the ultimate trial, yet few cases actually reach that point. Fewer than 5 percent of all cases commenced in the federal courts go to trial. Nevertheless, the trial process exercises a dominant influence on pretrial behavior because during the pretrial period the parties have to gather all the information that would be necessary at trial if it did occur. Moreover, for the majority of cases that settle, they do so on terms dictated by the parties’ estimates of what the outcome at trial would be, estimates shaped by the information gathered in the pretrial phase.</p>
<p id="c06783a0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If trial does occur, it consists of an elaborate pattern of symmetrical opportunities for the parties to present their cases. Plaintiff will have an opportunity to make an opening statement, following which defendant will get the same opportunity. <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="43" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page43">p. 43</span>Plaintiff can then present his case offering witnesses and documents; defendant can cross-examine each of plaintiffs’ witnesses to test their recollection and credibility. Defendant can then present his evidence, with plaintiff having the same opportunity for cross-examination. It all ends with both parties making closing statements. This pattern reflects two principles: that parties (not, as in many other systems, the judge) are responsible for proof; and that the party going first bears the burden of producing evidence and of persuading the trier of fact that his version of the case is more likely than not to be true.</p>
<p id="c06783a1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In U.S. courts, that trier of fact will sometimes be a jury. The Seventh Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and comparable provisions in state constitutions demonstrate a strong commitment to the idea of civil jury trial, an almost uniquely American institution.</p>
<p id="c06783a2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But that ideal has limits. Just as a judge may head off trial entirely by granting summary judgment, at trial a judge may refuse to submit a case to a jury or, after a jury has rendered its verdict, may grant judgment notwithstanding the verdict. See Rule 50(a). Under what circumstances should a judge grant such a motion for “judgment as a matter of law”? There is general agreement that if a party who has the burden of proof on an issue offers no evidence at all on that issue, judgment must be directed against him. There is similar agreement in cases in which the party with the burden of proof offers evidence that is simply too weak for any reasonable juror to believe. But what about a case involving evidence that, although weak, conceivably could be credited?</p>
<p id="c06783a3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts insist that it is the jury’s job to evaluate the credibility of witnesses and that, in passing on such motions, they will not consider whether witnesses are telling the truth. Courts are equally firm, however, in their belief that the function of judgment as a matter of law is to avoid (or overrule) jury deliberations in cases in which a jury could reasonably come to only one verdict. The next case involves a collision of these two principles. It uses two different terms for different stages at which the power of taking a case from the jury is exercised: “directed verdict,”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN109EE_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N109EE_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">8</a></span> to describe the exercise of judicial power before the case is given to the jury; and “judgment notwithstanding the verdict” to describe post-verdict reversal of the jury’s decision.</p>

<p id="c067aabc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Norton was, and still is, in the commercial lawn mowing business. He bought a Snapper riding mower in July 1981. On January 24, 1983, Norton was using this mower to clear leaves from a yard . . . adjacent to a creek. At the end of his third circular route through the yard, he drove up an incline, traveling in the direction away from the creek. Norton testified that as he reached the top of the incline, approximately six feet from the creek, the mower began to slide backwards toward the creek. Norton says he applied the brakes, but he continued to slide backwards. The lawn mower, with Norton still aboard, crashed into the creek. Norton testified that he kept both hands on the handle bars until the impact of the mower hitting the water knocked him off the seat. . . . [A]t some point during this crash, Norton’s hand was caught in the lawn mower’s blades, thereby amputating four of his fingers. It is not known . . . precisely how the injury occurred. . . . </p>
<p id="c067aabd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the close of the plaintiff’s case, and again at the close of all evidence, Snapper moved for a directed verdict. The court dismissed Norton’s negligence and warranty claims, but left the strict liability “defect” claim for the jury. The jury returned a verdict for Norton, holding Snapper liable for 80% of the injuries.</p>
<p id="c067aabe-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Immediately after dismissing the jury, the district court indicated it would enter a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>

<p id="c067d1d1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The test for granting a judgment notwithstanding the verdict is the same as the test for granting a directed verdict. The court considers the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and should grant the judgment notwithstanding the verdict only where the evidence so strongly and so favorably points in the favor of the moving party that reasonable people could not arrive at a contrary verdict. . . . </p>
<p id="c067d1d2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issues in this case were: (1) whether the failure to install “dead man” devices rendered the 1981 Snapper mower defective; and (2) if the lawn mower was defective, whether the lack of a “dead man” control caused Norton’s injury. . . . </p>
<p id="c067d1d3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Norton claims the Snapper mower was unreasonably dangerous because it did not have a “dead man” device. Although there are several types of such devices, the basic principle is the same in each type. In order to keep the lawn mower blades spinning, the operator has to remain in a certain position or has to continuously apply pressure to a pedal or handle. When the operator disengages the blades, they are quickly brought to a stop. The 1981 Snapper mowers were designed so that the blades would spin for three to five seconds after the power was turned off. Norton offered evidence that more sophisticated “dead man” devices are able to stop the blades in less than one second after the operator applies the brakes or releases the handle.</p>

<p id="c067d1d7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Fenner</i>, plaintiff contended his automobile veered off the highway because of a defective steering mechanism. The steering problem would only manifest itself if a stone got caught in the steering mechanism. Because plaintiff’s vehicle was not examined by any experts and since plaintiff’s experts were only able to say that theoretically the accident could have been caused by a stone in the steering mechanism, the district court entered a judgment notwithstanding the verdict for defendant. . . . </p>
<p id="c067d1d8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The causation evidence in this case, although circumstantial, was far more impressive than the evidence presented in <i>Fenner</i>. Norton testified that the lawn mower slid six feet from the top of the hill into the creek. . . . Expert testimony revealed that when Norton applied the brakes, an effective dead man device could have stopped the blades in as little as .7 seconds. The blades on the 1981 Snapper would continue to spin for three to five seconds. . . . Each of Snapper’s experts testified that, given the amount of time the mower would have taken to slide six feet and given Norton’s testimony that both of his hands were on the handle bars until the mower hit the creek, a two or three second difference in blade stopping time would have avoided the injury. . . . Snapper was given every opportunity to point out the weaknesses in Norton’s proof, but apparently was unpersuasive. . . . </p>

<li class=""><p id="c0686e25-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Houchens</i> was decided on a motion for summary judgment, under Rule 56; <i>Norton</i> was decided after trial on a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (now called a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law) under Rule 50. So the two motions come at different stages: The summary judgment motion usually comes at the end of discovery and always <i>before</i> trial commences. By contrast, a motion for judgment as a matter of law comes <i>during</i> or <i>after</i> trial when the evidence for one or both sides has already been presented. But both ask the same question: Is one party entitled to victory because there just isn’t any evidence to support the other side?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0686e26-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the two motions cover similar ground, why is there ever any need for judgment as a matter of law? Shouldn’t summary judgment have been granted if there really was no evidence to support one side? Logically, the answer would be that, in a perfect world, there should never be a successful motion for judgment as a matter of law—because all the cases in which one would be granted have been eliminated at the summary judgment stage. The real world is not so tidy. It often happens that what looks at the pretrial stage like an evidentiary conflict evaporates at trial: A witness fails to appear or tells a different story at trial than in the lawyer’s office. In that situation the motion for judgment as a matter of law serves as a back-up to summary judgment.</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0689537-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now turn to the facts of the two cases. In <i>Houchens</i> the court affirmed a grant of summary judgment while conceding it was possible that Houchens had died accidentally. Does the jury verdict in <i>Norton</i> rest on more than a finding that the absence of a dead-man mechanism <i>might</i> have caused the accident?</p></li>

The court of appeals has “reversed” and “remanded” the trial court’s decision, which means that the entry of judgment notwithstanding the verdict is reversed, and the case is remanded to the trial court. The district court should then enter judgment on the jury’s verdict.</p></li>

<p id="c068953b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus far, we have focused on the ways in which procedural rules create tactical opportunities for parties. Now, consider procedure as strategy for the judge. The trial judge in <i>Norton</i> denied a defense motion for a directed verdict: Doing so was tantamount to saying that a reasonable jury could find for the plaintiff. Then, when the jury did find for the plaintiff, the judge—looking at exactly the same evidence that was before him when he denied the directed verdict motion and applying the same legal standard—made the opposite ruling: that no reasonable jury could find for the plaintiff and judgment notwithstanding the verdict was appropriate. At the level of logic, the judge has to be wrong at least once—either when he denied the directed verdict motion or when he granted judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>
<p id="c068953c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Maybe there’s a deeper procedural logic at work here, a logic that emerges if one contemplates the interplay of trial and appellate courts and the costs of a second trial. When judges make rulings, they want them to be correct—at least in the sense that they will be affirmed on appeal. But a wise judge knows that not all her rulings will be affirmed, so sometimes judges take that into account. While we don’t know the thought processes of the trial judge in <i>Norton</i>, suppose he thought as follows: “I think I’m right in believing that there’s no proof of causation, but it’s a close case and an appellate court might reverse me. If I grant the directed verdict and send the jury home, and it then turns out that I’m wrong on causation, we’ll have to have a second trial—and product liability cases, with dueling expert testimony, take a good bit of time. Suppose, then, I deny the motion for a directed verdict, and let the jury decide the case. If they agree with me that there’s no causation, fine. But if they don’t—if they find for the plaintiff—I can still grant judgment notwithstanding the verdict. And, if the case is appealed and the appellate court disagrees with my ruling, we won’t have to try the case again. I’ll simply enter judgment on the original jury verdict.” Make sense?</p>

<p id="c068bc4f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most of us are vaguely familiar with the criminal law notion of double jeopardy, which prevents a person from being tried twice for the same crime. Not surprisingly, there is a similar notion in civil procedure. If Peters sues Dodge for injury to his car and loses, he should not be allowed to refile the same case, seeking damages for those same injuries, again. Lawyers speak of such questions under the general heading of former adjudication. There are actually two branches of former adjudication: claim preclusion (or, in its Latin equivalent, <i>res judicata</i> (literally, (some)thing adjudicated)) and issue preclusion (<i>collateral estoppel</i>). Claim preclusion prevents a case from being brought again (as in the <i>Peters v. Dodge</i> example). Issue preclusion prevents an issue from being revisited: If Peters sues Dodge for damage to his car and loses because the court finds the car did not actually belong to Peters, Peters would likely be bound by that finding in a future case.</p>

<p id="c068e366-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">George Ison appeals from a January 30, 2006 summary judgment of the Pendleton Circuit Court dismissing his claim against Anthony Thomas for personal injury damages. Ison contends that the trial court misapplied the rule against splitting one’s cause of action, an aspect of the doctrine of <i>res judicata.</i> We disagree and so affirm.</p>
<p id="c068e367-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ison alleges that in July 2003 Thomas injured him in an automobile accident on Kentucky Highway 9 near Foster in Pendleton County. Soon after the accident, in August 2003, Ison sued Thomas and Thomas’s insurer for losses arising from the damage to Ison’s vehicle. . . . A jury awarded him about $5,000.00 for his property losses. . . . Ison brought the present personal injury action against Thomas in April 2005. The trial court, noting the long standing rule in Kentucky that “one may not split up his cause of action and have it tried piecemeal,” Hays v. Sturgill, 302 Ky. 31, 34 (1946), ruled that Ison’s personal injury claim was part of the same cause of action as his property damage claim and so had merged with the prior judgment. We agree.</p>

<p id="c068e368-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the Kentucky Court of Appeals, then the state’s highest Court, stated in <i>Hays</i>: when a matter is in litigation, parties are required to bring forward their whole case; and the plea of <i>res judicata</i> applies not only to the points upon which the court was required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation, and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time.</p>

<p id="c0690a7c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ison’s contention that the rule against splitting one’s cause of action does not apply if the plaintiff prevails in the prior action is without merit. . . . If the plaintiff <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="49" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page49">p. 49</span>prevails on his initial claim, other claims arising from the same transaction are said to merge with his judgment, and if the plaintiff loses initially, that judgment is said to bar any such subsequent claim. Restatement (Second), Judgments, §§18, 19 (1982). In either case, the subsequent action is precluded.</p>
<p id="c0690a7d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, Ison contends that Thomas waived the affirmative <i>res judicata</i> defense by failing to plead it in his answer to Ison’s complaint. He notes, correctly, that CR 8.03 [analogous to Federal Rule 8(c)(1)] requires affirmative defenses such as <i>res judicata</i> to be “set forth affirmatively” in the answer, that is, that the pleading should give fair notice of the particular defense and a short statement of its grounds. . . . We agree with Ison that Thomas’s Answer . . . did not satisfy a notice standard for any particular affirmative defense. Nevertheless, CR 8.03 is not to be applied mechanically, and waiver need not be found where the affirmative defense is raised by timely motion that does not prejudice the plaintiff.</p>
<p id="c0690a7e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, Thomas raised the <i>res judicata</i> defense in a motion for summary judgment in September 2005, only about five months into the case and before either party had expended much on discovery. . . . </p>
<p id="c0690a7f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, our law requires that all claims against a single defendant arising from a single negligent incident be brought in a single action. Ison improperly split his claim for property damages from his claim for personal injury damages, where both claims arose against a single defendant as a result of a single automobile accident. The damages claims should have been brought together, and because they were not, the trial court correctly ruled that the subsequent action is barred. Accordingly, we affirm the January 30, 2006 order of the Pendleton Circuit Court.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0697fbd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Note that in the other cases in this chapter, the result flowed from interpreting and applying a Rule or a statute. Not here; why? Because, unlike the other areas encountered in this chapter—and in most of the rest of this course—the principles of former adjudication have been developed by courts on a case-by-case basis rather than being set forth in statutes or Rules. Nothing in principle prevents there being such a statute, but the effort of drafting one has not recommended itself to Congress or to state legislatures. When you study the principles of former adjudication in greater detail in Chapter 11 you may better understand why legislatures have left this area to the courts.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0697fbe-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although Congress and legislatures may be wise to avoid legislating former adjudication, this decision makes this topic relatively unusual in your Civil Procedure course. It stands out as an island in a sea of legislation and Rule-making. A thousand years ago—even two hundred years ago—the geography of procedure looked different. For many centuries judges made most procedural law in the course of adjudication, with the occasional statute standing out as an island in a sea of common law. Two great movements of procedural reform starting in the second half of the nineteenth century gave legislatures (and later Rule-makers) the dominant position they enjoy today, leaving only a few common law islands (such as former adjudication) remaining.</p></li>

<p id="c0697fc1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our judicial system permits a losing party to appeal an adverse judgment of the trial court to a higher court. One might imagine that an appellate court can correct any errors that the trial court has made. Yet procedural rules limit in two significant respects appellate courts’ power of review.</p>
<p id="c069a6d2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="51" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page51">p. 51</span>The first limitation concerns the standard of the appellate courts’ review. Put in very simplified form, existing doctrine tells the appellate courts that they should affirm findings of fact unless “clearly erroneous.” By contrast, rulings of law should only be affirmed if the appellate court would have reached the same conclusion. But, regardless of the standard of review, the court of appeals should not reverse unless the lower court’s error affected the outcome of the lawsuit. Finally, in many areas, the law itself gives the trial judge discretion to balance competing concerns in making a ruling—for example, whether the potential information to be gained from a particular discovery request is outweighed by the financial burden of complying with that discovery request. In those areas, the issue on appeal is not whether the appellate court judges would themselves have balanced the competing interests the same way, but whether the trial court can be said to have abused its discretion.</p>
<p id="c069a6d3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second limitation concerns the timing of appellate review. Imagine that a trial judge has made an important discovery ruling, one that both parties believe will affect the outcome of the case. Further, suppose that the ruling is at least questionable and that the party on the losing end of the ruling appeals. Read 28 U.S.C. §1291, which defines the jurisdiction of the federal courts of appeals: “The courts of appeals . . . shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all <i>final</i> decisions of the district court. . . . .  . . . ” (emphasis added). That bland statement has a negative implication: that the courts of appeals do <i>not</i> have jurisdiction over an effort to appeal from an order that is not a “final decision.” Lawyers call a non-final order “interlocutory.” The next case shows “the final judgment rule,” as it is often called, applied to a discovery order under Rule 35 for a mental examination of the plaintiff.</p>

Reise, who was graduated in the top 5% of his class from the Law School of the University of Wisconsin at Madison, applied for a position on its faculty. The Law School did not hire him. He believes that his race and sex account for the decision, that in recent years the Law School has been unwilling to consider anyone, no matter how skilled, who is not black, female, or otherwise eligible for preferential treatment. According to Reise, only one of the last thirteen appointments to the faculty has been a white male, and that appointment was made in 1985. The Law School says that the persons it hired are better lawyers and scholars than Reise. The district court has set a trial for this coming April to get at the truth.</p>
<p id="c069cdea-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Reise has filed an appeal] . . . asking us to reverse the judge’s order that he submit to a mental examination under Fed. R. Civ. P. 35. Reise demands $4 million in compensatory damages on account of the mental anguish, emotional distress, and illness that he says he has endured as a result of the Law School’s decision not to hire him. Not surprisingly, the Law School wants to obtain a medical opinion on Reise’s mental state, so that it may present evidence on that subject at trial. Reise insists that because he is over his distress and is not seeking damages on account of his <i>current</i> mental <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="52" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page52">p. 52</span>condition, an examination would reveal nothing of value. Again not surprisingly, the Law School is not content with Reise’s say-so and wants to check. The district judge, siding with the Law School, ordered Reise to undergo an examination.</p>

<p id="c069cdec-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is too late in the day to waste words explaining why interlocutory orders, and discovery orders in particular, are not appealable despite their irreversible costs. Because almost all interlocutory appeals from discovery orders would end in affirmance (the district court possesses discretion, and review is deferential), the costs of delay via appeal, and the costs to the judicial system of entertaining these appeals, exceed in the aggregate the costs of the few erroneous discovery orders that might be corrected were appeals available. . . . </p>
<p id="c069cded-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Discovery orders, including orders to submit to an examination, are readily reviewable after final decision. A party aggrieved by the order assures eventual review by refusing to comply. The district judge then imposes sanctions under Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2). The probable sanction in a case such as this is an order striking Reise’s claim for damages on account of mental and physical distress. If Reise should prevail on the merits but not obtain damages because of the order striking his claim, he may obtain full review on appeal: if the district judge abused his discretion in requiring Reise to submit to an examination, we will remand for further proceedings. True, this procedure creates a potential for two trials, but then so does any other discovery order, or an order disqualifying or failing to disqualify counsel, or any order granting or denying partial summary judgment. . . . And requiring the complaining party to take some risk—to back up his belief with action—winnows weak claims. Only persons who have <i>substantial</i> objections to the examination and believe their legal positions strong will follow a path that could end in defeat. Among those who take the risk by balking at the order, some will lose on the merits, and their discovery disputes will become moot. Most of the remaining cases will end in affirmance, given deferential review. The number of retrials entailed by the procedure is small, the number of appeals avoided large.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c069f503-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The argument against the final judgment rule relies on a different kind of pragmatic reasoning. Most cases will not end in a judgment of any sort—the parties will settle. Judicial rulings that precede settlements are not appealable, but those rulings may have dictated the terms of the settlement by greatly advantaging one party. In those settled cases—the majority of all cases—it seems unjust to allow what may be practically dispositive judicial rulings to escape appellate review. Some states, New York most notable among them, have adopted this reasoning by providing for liberal interlocutory appeal of significant trial court rulings. Others (the federal courts included) create some statutory exceptions to the final judgment rule and weasel a bit with judge-made doctrines that slightly soften its impact. It is nevertheless still fair to say that the rule poses an insuperable barrier to immediate appeal of many trial court rulings.</p></li>

Plaintiff cannot appeal unless the case goes to final judgment, but it will cost plaintiff considerable time and money to get to that stage.

<p id="c06a4339-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this and other law school courses you will read a good many appellate opinions from state and federal courts. What determines which court will hear such an appeal?</p>
<p id="c06a433a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The most basic proposition is that the appellate courts of whatever system the case starts in will hear subsequent appeals. Thus in the federal system, parties who lose a “final decision” in the district court can appeal to the court of appeals. The courts of appeals hear cases from district courts in regions covering several states, <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="55" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page55">p. 55</span>each region being called a “circuit.” There are 11 circuits covering the 50 states, a twelfth for the District of Columbia, and a thirteenth, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears appeals in certain specialized cases—patent actions, for example. Thus the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit hears cases from the district courts in Connecticut, Vermont, and New York; the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit hears cases from the district courts in Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin. Atop the courts of appeals is the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>
<p id="c06a6a4b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The same principle applies in the state courts. <i>Ison v. Thomas</i> was decided by the Kentucky Court of Appeals because the case was initially heard by a Kentucky trial court. Most states have an appellate structure resembling the federal system—a trial court of general jurisdiction, an intermediate appellate court to which all cases may be appealed, and a state supreme court<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10D30_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10D30_d5438a64-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">9</a></span> that has discretion over which cases it will hear. In some states, however, there is no intermediate appellate court, so appeals go directly to the state supreme court.</p>
<p id="c06a6a4d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How and when does the U.S. Supreme Court get into the act? Cases reach the Supreme Court in two ways—from federal courts and from state courts. In both instances Supreme Court review is discretionary: The Justices pick and choose which cases they will hear. Thus, parties who lose in the highest state court or federal court of appeals must apply to the Supreme Court to have their case heard, which they do by asking the Court to grant a <i>writ of certiorari</i>. See 28 U.S.C. §§1253-1258.</p>
<p id="c06a6a4e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is an additional barrier to U.S. Supreme Court review of state court cases. The Supreme Court may hear a state court case <i>only</i> if it presents an issue of federal law. It cannot hear cases from the state supreme court that involve solely questions of state law. In other words, cases like <i>Ison</i> that exclusively concern state law—there, state law rules governing former adjudication—cannot be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. This rule does not stop people from trying to get their case heard by the Supreme Court. How might they do so? If they can “make a federal case” out of it—perhaps by arguing that Kentucky’s laws governing former adjudication violate the U.S. Constitution’s Due Process Clause. (That’s a losing argument on <i>Ison</i>’s facts, but it would be the only imaginable way of dragging federal law into the case.)</p>
<p id="c06a6a4f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, because the Court enjoys broad discretion in selecting which cases it will hear, a decision not to review a case does not signify approval of the decision rendered by the court below. So, if the U.S. Supreme Court denies petition for certiorari, that doesn’t mean it affirmed the lower court’s ruling; it just decided not to review the case.</p>

<p id="c06a6a52-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During the year you will encounter repeated discussion of procedural issues in various substantive courses.

A Property class may explore the defects in a plaintiff’s complaint for trespass that led the court to grant a motion to dismiss. These scenarios do not represent efforts by your other instructors to seize pedagogical territory by conquest. Instead they reflect the role that substantive law plays in procedural decisions and that procedure plays in substantive law.</p>
<p id="c06a6a53-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lawsuits grow from disputes. Parties may dispute what happened and what consequences the law attaches to those happenings. At several stages of litigation, procedure establishes hurdles that a party must jump. Demurrers or Rule 12(b)(6) motions are one such hurdle; motions for summary judgment, a directed verdict, or a judgment notwithstanding the verdict are others. All these procedural devices require the judge to reflect on the substantive law that applies to the case and to describe the way in which that law applies to the facts as they then appear: that makes such cases good teaching tools for the substantive law involved.</p>
<p id="c06a6a54-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Focusing on the procedural stance of the case clarifies two points. First, seeing that the case arises on an appeal from a motion to dismiss, an objection to jury instructions, or the like explains <i>why</i> the judge is engaging in a recitation of the substantive law. Second, understanding the procedural stance of the case enables you to see how much of what the court says depends purely on a legal assessment of the case and how much depends on a factual assessment. For example, on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court considers whether the plaintiff’s allegations in the complaint, if proved, would entitle him to the court’s help; it does not consider whether it is likely that the plaintiff could prove the truth of those statements. On a motion for summary judgment or a directed verdict, by contrast, the court must consider both the law that applies to the case and the evidence that the parties have gathered and presented.</p>
<p id="c06a9165-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Procedure will thus play two roles in your substantive courses. First, various procedural hurdles will provide the occasion for judicial expositions of the law of torts, property, contract, and crimes. Second, by understanding the procedural stage at which the issue under discussion arose, you will also understand the extent to which the court is considering the facts of the particular case. Comprehending this dual role will enable you to see both the way in which procedure shapes substantive law and the reason procedural discussions will often play a central role in learning that substantive law.</p>

<p id="c06b06af-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q1.</b> B and D are the correct responses. B is correct because Rule 11—as well as analogous rules of professional responsibility—require the lawyer to investigate his client’s version of the facts before filing a complaint (and so it makes sense to do this investigation before deciding whether to assume the responsibilities of representation). D is correct because Peters will have to rely on diversity jurisdiction to make it into federal court and, as <i>Hawkins</i> (and a thousand other cases) teach, determining diversity involves both physical residence and objective indications of an intent to remain indefinitely. Taking steps like registering to vote and registering his motor vehicle in Michigan may help Peters make such a showing. A is wrong because such tactical decisions are for the lawyer rather than the client; even a law student like Peters is unlikely to be able to make a sensible choice about such a matter. C is wrong because the lawyer will want to verify Peters’s story before drafting any complaint.</p>

A: A pre-answer motion may be made on any of the grounds listed in Rule 12(b). B: An answer is always an appropriate response to a complaint, and the most common response in an answer is a denial of one or more key allegations of the complaint. D: One may make a pre-answer motion, but one may equally decide instead to answer and to assert as defenses matters that might have been the subject of a pre-answer motion (such as lack of subject matter jurisdiction). C is wrong: A 12(b)(6) motion assumes—for the purposes of argument—that all the allegations of the complaint are true. To dispute those allegations—including the allegation of the date of the accident—one would file an answer denying whichever allegations one wants to dispute and then marshal evidence supporting one’s claim during discovery, to be used at summary judgment.</p>

C is correct because, as in <i>Gordon</i>, a party can resist discovery on grounds of proportionality, including expense in relation to likely relevance. D is correct because none of the discovery rulings described will be a final judgment. A is wrong because by bringing suit to recover for his injuries Peters has waived the privilege. B is wrong because our legal system requires nonparties to offer any relevant, unprivileged evidence they possess.</p>
<p id="c06b06b2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q4.</b> A is the only correct response. B is incorrect because, even though the evidence appears to favor Peters, the witnesses could be mistaken and the jury’s central function is to sort out the truth from the clash of testimony. C is incorrect for the same reason. D is wrong because preclusion would apply only if Peters had previously brought <i>this</i> claim against Dodge (as was the case in <i>Ison v. Thomas</i>).</p><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="60" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page60">p. 60</span>

<p id="c072f5f5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One can study the procedural system from the top down or from the bottom up. The top-down approach starts with the constitutional environment in which the individual lawsuit exists. That approach takes the student into both the history and the current interpretation of the Constitution of the United States. Studying the Constitution reveals several limits on the ways in which state and federal court systems conduct their business—limits that have major consequences for individual litigants. The bottom-up approach begins with the life cycle of an individual lawsuit: how the parties initially state their grievances, develop information about them, and bring them to resolution. This approach emphasizes features and problems of the contemporary procedural system, which is in many respects a bold experiment. Studying the process of litigation reveals how these features shape and constrain the litigants’ responsibilities and choices.</p>
<p id="c0731d06-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As you have probably already guessed, anyone wanting to become a lawyer has to understand both approaches, to comprehend the constitutional environment as well as the modes for processing disputes. This book accordingly contains materials about both approaches, and most courses will examine both. But one can with equal validity start at the top and work down or begin at the bottom and work up. The three parts of this book are labeled to emphasize these different starting <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="62" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page62">p. 62</span>points. Some courses may begin with Part I: The Constitutional Framework for U.S. Litigation, comprising Chapters 2-4. This starting point represents the “top-down” approach. Other classes may move first to Part II: The Process of Litigation, comprising Chapters 5-11 and representing the “bottom-up” approach. The last part of this book, Part III: Probing the Boundaries: Additional Claims and Parties, combines significant elements of both the other parts and may be studied either at the end of the course, as a reprise, or in conjunction with either of the other two parts. The next three chapters represent an approach to litigation starting at the top—with the constitutional framework.</p>

<p id="c0731d09-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The U.S. Constitution dictates many fundamental aspects of a lawsuit—not only in landmark cases but in ordinary civil litigation. For example, someone looking at the U.S. system from the outside might conclude that it would be more efficient to have a single, unitary court system for all disputes rather than 51 separate systems (one for each state and one for the federal government). Efficient it might be, but it would also be unconstitutional, for reasons you will come to understand. The next three chapters develop several of the most important ways the Constitution shapes litigation in the United States. Two of those ways involve “jurisdiction,” a protean and important word in U.S. litigation; a third involves “choice of law.”</p>

<p id="c0731d0c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No legal system in the world claims the power to decide all disputes arising anywhere. Which cases, then, will a legal system resolve? Consider this question concretely. Imagine that you live in Illinois and come to California to attend law school. A particularly contentious sort, you become involved in two disputes during your first year there: You think your landlord is failing to maintain your apartment, and you think one of your instructors unfairly rejects you for a position as a part-time research assistant. In the first case, you might start by complaining to the landlord; in the second, to the instructor or the dean. You would <i>not</i> seek relief from the landlord of the building next door or from the dean of another law school. You would not do so because the landlord of the other building and the dean of the other school have no power over the conditions in your apartment or school. Putting the matter very loosely, one could say the condition of your apartment and the employment decision fall outside of their <i>jurisdictions</i>: Say what they might about the poor state of garbage collection or the unfairness of failing to hire you, they are powerless to remedy either.</p>
<p id="c0731d0d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You will repeatedly encounter the concept of jurisdiction while studying law and will soon discover that the term is used in several different ways. More or less literally, “jurisdiction” means the power to declare the law. By extension, it has acquired several other meanings. Lawyers may speak of “the law of a jurisdiction” or “legislative jurisdiction,” using the term in both instances to <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="63" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page63">p. 63</span>signify a state or territory whose government has the power to make law within its bounds. In civil procedure it has a narrower meaning. Lawyers sometimes refer to jurisdiction in this narrower sense as “judicial jurisdiction”: the power of a court to render a judgment that other courts and government agencies will recognize and enforce.</p>
<p id="c0731d0e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You might encounter jurisdiction in this narrower legal sense if your two imaginary disputes escalated and you sued either the landlord or the instructor. If during the dispute with your landlord you returned to Illinois for the summer and there filed an action against your California landlord, you might well be met with the defense that courts in Illinois have no jurisdiction over the landlord. If you filed suit in federal court in California against the instructor, a different kind of jurisdiction question might arise. While conceding that the instructor could be sued in California, the defendants might challenge the jurisdiction of <i>federal</i> courts over the lawsuit: Whether the challenge was successful would depend on whether you could either frame your challenge to the hiring decision as a claim “arising under federal law” or convince the court that you were still a “citizen” of Illinois and that you and the defendant(s) were thus of diverse citizenship.</p>

<p id="c0736b38-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The next two chapters explore the ways in which courts in the United States conceive of and resolve questions like those raised in the preceding hypothetical case. Exploring the topic will be easier if you have some sense of both the terminology and the context in which jurisdictional issues arise. The basic terminology requires the student to distinguish between “personal” jurisdiction, the focus of Chapter 2, and “subject matter” jurisdiction, the focus of Chapter 3. Lawyers would describe the challenge to the Illinois suit against your California landlord as involving a question of <i>personal jurisdiction</i>—the power of an Illinois court to render a judgment binding someone who may have never set foot in Illinois. They would describe <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="64" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page64">p. 64</span>the challenge to the federal courts’ power to decide the question whether you were wrongly refused a part-time job as raising the issue of federal courts’ <i>subject matter jurisdiction</i>—the power of federal (as opposed to state) courts to decide certain kinds of cases. At the outset you need only bear in mind that personal and subject matter jurisdiction are <i>both</i> necessary ingredients of any court’s power to render a binding decision in a case; that is, a court must have both subject matter and personal jurisdiction to render a valid judgment.</p>
<p id="c0736b39-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The deep concern with jurisdiction ranks high among the distinguishing characteristics of the Anglo-American legal system. The concept has special significance in the United States, where government power is divided among states and between the states as a whole and the federal government: No single government entity has plenary power. This system of limited and overlapping authority means that government agencies—including courts—must repeatedly decide which agency has the power to exercise authority in a given situation. Because the federal Constitution defines the lines of authority among the competing centers of power, courts look to the Constitution for their basic framework in deciding issues of judicial jurisdiction. This aspect of civil procedure will be for many students their first law school encounter with the Constitution, the text of which appears in the supplement that accompanies this casebook.</p>
<p id="c0736b3a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Three parts of the Constitution bear on jurisdiction. Article III authorizes the establishment of the system of federal courts and in §2 sets the limits of federal judicial authority. Federal courts cannot exceed those jurisdictional boundaries, and Congress has the power in many instances to restrict the scope of federal judicial authority more narrowly than does the Constitution. The constraints imposed by Article III and the legislation implementing it are the focus of Chapter 3, on subject matter jurisdiction.</p>
<p id="c0736b3b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Article IV, §1 requires that “Full Faith and Credit  . . .  be given in each State to judicial proceedings of every other State.” The Supreme Court has interpreted this clause to require that one state recognize and enforce judgments of another state. For example, suppose a court in State <i>A</i> enters a judgment for $100,000 against <i>D</i>, but plaintiff cannot find any assets of <i>D</i> within State <i>A</i> to satisfy the judgment. <i>D</i>’s only assets turn out to be a large bank account at a bank located in State <i>B</i>. Under the Full Faith and Credit Clause (and state legislation implementing it), plaintiff commences a summary proceeding in a court in State <i>B</i>, records State <i>A</i>’s judgment, and can then obtain a writ of execution from the State <i>B</i> court enforcing State <i>A</i>’s judgment against any assets of <i>D</i> located in State <i>B</i>. As you are about to see, however, the Full Faith and Credit Clause has an important unstated condition—such judgments are entitled to full faith and credit only if the court rendering them had jurisdiction to do so.</p>
<p id="c0736b3c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that no “State [shall] deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.” This clause, known as the Due Process Clause, has proved to be one of the cornerstones of modern constitutional and procedural theory. It derives its relation to jurisdiction from <i>Pennoyer v. Neff</i>, a case that might be termed the great-grandparent of personal jurisdiction, the topic of Chapter 2. As you will see, <i>Pennoyer</i> made the question of what we now call personal jurisdiction part of the Constitution.<div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="65" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page65">p. 65</span></p>

<p id="c073b968-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Beyond personal and subject matter jurisdiction, the Constitution shapes U.S. litigation in a third way: It sometimes dictates which set of laws a court must apply to a dispute. There are two key ways in which the Constitution dictates choice of law. First, Article VI provides that the Constitution and federal laws “shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.” This provision is commonly referred to as the Supremacy Clause. Although the Supremacy Clause typically arises in a Constitutional Law class rather than in Civil Procedure, for present purposes it is enough to understand that the clause means that if Congress has validly enacted a statute dealing with a particular subject, both federal and state courts are required to enforce the federal statute, regardless of whether there is a contrary state statute or state common law rule.</p>

For an example of how such an issue might arise, imagine that your hypothetical dispute with your California landlord found its way to a federal court. Which law would the court apply to the dispute? Would it be bound by the California law of landlord and tenant? Or would it be free to apply what it thought was a more sensible or just system of regulation to the dispute before it? That question is the focus of Chapter 4, and is answered in significant part by the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Erie Railroad v. Tompkins</i>. <i>Erie</i> is a case of constitutional dimensions—or so it insists—but, unlike personal or subject matter jurisdiction, one cannot readily locate the constitutional provisions from which it flows; that enigma itself is part of the problem. Together with personal and subject matter jurisdiction, the Supremacy Clause and the <i>Erie</i> doctrine shape the environment in which U.S. litigation operates.</p>

<p id="c076788c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Personal jurisdiction doctrine concerns, in the simplest terms, a state’s ability to assert power over a defendant in a civil lawsuit. It became part of U.S. constitutional law because of <i>Pennoyer v. Neff</i>, a case whose facts spawned a truly splendid doctrinal elaboration. To understand those facts you need to have some background. One of the more difficult parts of a lawsuit often comes at its end, when a victorious plaintiff tries to collect the judgment from the defendant, who declines to pay. When this happens, the plaintiff may obtain a writ of execution from the court, which will authorize the sheriff to seize any property belonging to the defendant, sell it (typically through an auction), and give the resulting money to the plaintiff (up to the amount of the judgment). When that sale occurs, the sheriff gives to whomever buys the defendant’s property a “sheriff’s deed” as evidence of title. The second piece of background you need for <i>Pennoyer</i> concerns the idea of “constructive” notice. In law “constructive” generally means “fictional” or “pretend.” Defendants generally receive service of process, but what happens if no one can find the defendant? Under those conditions some states provide for a notice in a newspaper—in those fine-print columns no one reads. Under such conditions notice is “constructive” because it is highly unlikely that the defendant will actually see it. Finally, you need to know that “attachment” is the legal term for an officially sanctioned seizure of property: Real estate, cars, and other property may be “attached.” Sometimes “attachment” means literal seizure; other times it means posting notices on property or on records of title so that prospective buyers know it cannot be sold by the owner with title.<div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="68" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page68">p. 68</span></p>

<p id="c0767892-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The case concerned two lawsuits. The first suit grew from an unpaid legal fee. Marcus Neff hired Mitchell, a lawyer living and practicing in Oregon, to do some legal work. When Neff failed to pay Mitchell’s fee (evidently less than $300), Mitchell sued him in state court. At the time of this first suit Neff was, in the court’s words, “a non-resident of the State [who] was not personally served with process, and did not appear [i.e., did not come to court or otherwise resist the lawsuit]. . . . [J]udgment was entered upon his default in not answering the complaint, upon a constructive service of summons by publication.” <i>After</i> this default judgment, Neff acquired 300 acres of land (allegedly worth $15,000) in Oregon from the federal government. To satisfy his judgment Mitchell had the sheriff seize and sell Neff’s land. Pennoyer bought it and received a sheriff’s deed as evidence of title. The sheriff then turned the sale proceeds over to Mitchell. Sometime after these events Neff reappeared, and when he discovered what had become of his land, he brought the second lawsuit with which <i>Pennoyer</i> is concerned. Neff sued Pennoyer in federal court “to recover the possession of [the] tract of land.” As evidence of their respective titles, Neff pointed to the original government deed, and Pennoyer pointed to the sheriff’s deed. In this second suit the court thus had to decide whether the first lawsuit and the sheriff’s sale had extinguished Neff’s title. The opinion begins with an analysis of the form of notice in the first suit.]</p>
<p id="c0767893-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Code of Oregon provides for such [constructive] service when an action is brought against a non-resident and absent defendant, who has property within the State. It also provides, where the action is for the recovery of money or damages, for the attachment of the property of the non-resident. And it also declares that no natural person is subject to the jurisdiction of a court of the State, “unless he appear in the court, or be found within the State, or be a resident thereof, or have property therein; and, in the last case, only to the extent of such property at the time the jurisdiction attached.” Construing this latter provision to mean that, in an action for money or damages where a defendant does not appear in the court, and is not found within the State, and is not a resident thereof, but has property therein, the jurisdiction of the court extends only over such property, the declaration expresses a principle of general, if not universal, law. The authority of every tribunal is necessarily restricted by the territorial limits of the State in which it is established. Any attempt to exercise authority beyond those limits would be deemed in every other forum, as has been said by this court, an illegitimate assumption of power, and be resisted as mere abuse. D’Arcy v. Ketchum et al., 11 How. 165. In the case against the plaintiff, the property here in controversy sold under the judgment rendered was not attached, nor in any way brought under the jurisdiction of the court. Its first connection with the case was caused by a levy of the execution. It was not, therefore, disposed of pursuant to any adjudication, but only in enforcement of a personal judgment, having no relation to the property, rendered against a non-resident without service of process upon him in the action, or his appearance therein. The court below did not consider <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="69" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page69">p. 69</span>that an attachment of the property was essential to its jurisdiction or to the validity of the sale, but held that the judgment was invalid from defects in the affidavit upon which the order of publication was obtained, and in the affidavit by which the publication was proved.</p>
<p id="c0769fa4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is some difference of opinion among the members of this court as to the rulings upon these alleged defects [about whether the statute required an affidavit from the “printer,” as the statute specified, or whether one from the editor would suffice]. If, therefore, we were confined to the rulings of the court below upon the defects in the affidavits mentioned, we should be unable to uphold its decision. But it was also contended in that court, and is insisted upon here, that the judgment in the State court against the plaintiff was void for want of personal service of process on him, or of his appearance in the action in which it was rendered, and that the premises in controversy could not be subjected to the payment of the demand of a resident creditor except by a proceeding in rem; that is, by a direct proceeding against the property for that purpose. If these positions are sound, the ruling of the Circuit Court as to the invalidity of that judgment must be sustained, notwithstanding our dissent from the reasons upon which it was made. And that they are sound would seem to follow from two well-established principles of public law respecting the jurisdiction of an independent State over persons and property. The several States of the Union are not, it is true, in every respect independent, many of the rights and powers which originally belonged to them being now vested in the government created by the Constitution. But, except as restrained and limited by that instrument, they possess and exercise the authority of independent States, and the principles of public law to which we have referred are applicable to them. One of these principles is, that every State possesses exclusive jurisdiction and sovereignty over persons and property within its territory. As a consequence, every State has the power to determine for itself the civil status and capacities of its inhabitants; to prescribe the subjects upon which they may contract, the forms and solemnities with which their contracts shall be executed, the rights and obligations arising from them, and the mode in which their validity shall be determined and their obligations enforced; and also to regulate the manner and conditions upon which property situated within such territory, both personal and real, may be acquired, enjoyed, and transferred. The other principle of public law referred to follows from the one mentioned; that is, that no State can exercise direct jurisdiction and authority over persons or property without its territory. Story, Confl. Laws, c. 2; Wheat. Int. Law, pt. 2, c. 2. The several States are of equal dignity and authority, and the independence of one implies the exclusion of power from all others. And so it is laid down by jurists, as an elementary principle, that the laws of one State have no operation outside of its territory, except so far as is allowed by comity; and that no tribunal established by it can extend its process beyond that territory so as to subject either persons or property to its decisions. “Any exertion of authority of this sort beyond this limit,” says Story, “is a mere nullity, and incapable of binding such persons or property in any other tribunals.” Story, Confl. Laws, sect. 539.</p>
<p id="c0769fa5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But as contracts made in one State may be enforceable only in another State, and property may be held by non-residents, the exercise of the jurisdiction which every State is admitted to possess over persons and property within its own territory will often affect persons and property without it. To any influence exerted in this way by <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="70" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page70">p. 70</span>a State affecting persons resident or property situated elsewhere, no objection can be justly taken; whilst any direct exertion of authority upon them, in an attempt to give ex-territorial operation to its laws, or to enforce an ex-territorial jurisdiction by its tribunals, would be deemed an encroachment upon the independence of the State in which the persons are domiciled or the property is situated, and be resisted as usurpation.</p>
<p id="c0769fa6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus the State, through its tribunals, may compel persons domiciled within its limits to execute, in pursuance of their contracts respecting property elsewhere situated, instruments in such form and with such solemnities as to transfer the title, so far as such formalities can be complied with; and the exercise of this jurisdiction in no manner interferes with the supreme control over the property by the State within which it is situated.</p>
<p id="c0769fa7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So the State, through its tribunals, may subject property situated within its limits owned by non-residents to the payment of the demand of its own citizens against them; and the exercise of this jurisdiction in no respect infringes upon the sovereignty of the State where the owners are domiciled. Every State owes protection to its own citizens; and, when non-residents deal with them, it is a legitimate and just exercise of authority to hold and appropriate any property owned by such non-residents to satisfy the claims of its citizens. It is in virtue of the State’s jurisdiction over the property of the non-resident situated within its limits that its tribunals can inquire into that non-resident’s obligations to its own citizens, and the inquiry can then be carried only to the extent necessary to control the disposition of the property. If the non-residents have no property in the State, there is nothing upon which the tribunals can adjudicate. . . . </p>
<p id="c0769fa8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If, without personal service, judgments <i>in personam</i>, obtained ex parte against non-residents and absent parties, upon mere publication of process, which, in the great majority of cases, would never be seen by the parties interested, could be upheld and enforced, they would be the constant instruments of fraud and oppression. Judgments for all sorts of claims upon contracts and for torts, real or pretended, would be thus obtained, under which property would be seized, when the evidence of the transactions upon which they were founded, if they ever had any existence, had perished.</p>
<p id="c0769fa9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Substituted service by publication, or in any other authorized form, may be sufficient to inform parties of the object of proceedings taken where property is once brought under the control of the court by seizure or some equivalent act. The law assumes that property is always in the possession of its owner, in person or by agent; and it proceeds upon the theory that its seizure will inform him, not only that it is taken into the custody of the court, but that he must look to any proceedings authorized by law upon such seizure for its condemnation and sale. Such service may also be sufficient in cases where the object of the action is to reach and dispose of property in the State, or of some interest therein, by enforcing a contract or a lien respecting the same, or to partition it among different owners, or, when the public is a party, to condemn and appropriate it for a public purpose. In other words, such service may answer in all actions which are substantially proceedings in rem. But where the entire object of the action is to determine the personal rights and obligations of the defendants, that is, where the suit is merely in personam, constructive service in this form upon a nonresident is ineffectual for any purpose. Process from the tribunals of one <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="71" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page71">p. 71</span>State cannot run into another State, and summon parties there domiciled to leave its territory and respond to proceedings against them. Publication of process or notice within the State where the tribunal sits cannot create any greater obligation upon the non-resident to appear: Process sent to him out of the State, and process published within it, are equally unavailing in proceedings to establish his personal liability. . . . </p>
<p id="c0769faa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The Court then responded to Pennoyer’s argument that it should make no difference whether Oregon had attached Neff’s property at the outset of Mitchell’s lawsuit against Neff, or whether Oregon seized Neff’s property after Mitchell had obtained the judgment against Neff for the unpaid attorneys’ fees.] [The Oregon court’s] jurisdiction in that respect cannot be made to depend upon facts to be ascertained after it has tried the cause and rendered the judgment. If the judgment be previously void, it will not become valid by the subsequent discovery of property of the defendant, or by his subsequent acquisition of it. The judgment, if void when rendered, will always remain void: it cannot occupy the doubtful position of being valid if property be found, and void if there be none. . . . [T]he validity of every judgment depends upon the jurisdiction of the court before it is rendered, not upon what may occur subsequently. . . . </p>
<p id="c0769fab-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Webster v. Reid</i>, reported in 11th of Howard, the plaintiff claimed title to land sold under judgments recovered in suits brought in a territorial court of Iowa, upon publication of notice under a law of the territory, without service of process; and the court said: “These suits were not a proceeding in rem against the land, but were in personam against the owners of it. . . . No person is required to answer in a suit on whom process has not been served, or whose property has not been attached. In this case, there was no personal notice, nor an attachment or other proceeding against the land, until after the judgments. The judgments, therefore, are nullities, and did not authorize the executions on which the land was sold.”</p>
<p id="c0769fac-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The force and effect of judgments rendered against non-residents without personal service of process upon them, or their voluntary appearance, have been the subject of frequent consideration in the courts of the United States and of the several States, as attempts have been made to enforce such judgments in States other than those in which they were rendered, under the provision of the Constitution requiring that “full faith and credit shall be given in each State to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other State”; and the act of Congress [current version at 28 U.S.C. §1738] providing for the mode of authenticating such acts, records, and proceedings, and declaring that, when thus authenticated, “they shall have such faith and credit given to them in every court within the United States as they have by law or usage in the courts of the State from which they are or shall be taken.” In the earlier cases, it was supposed that the act gave to all judgments the same effect in other States which they had by law in the State where rendered. But this view was afterwards qualified so as to make the act applicable only when the court rendering the judgment had jurisdiction of the parties and of the subject-matter, and not to preclude an inquiry into the jurisdiction of the court in which the judgment was rendered, or the right of the State itself to exercise authority over the person or the subject-matter. M’Elmoyle v. Cohen, 13 Pet. 312. . . . </p>
<p id="c076c6bd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, the validity of such judgments may be directly questioned, and their enforcement in <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="72" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page72">p. 72</span>the State resisted, on the ground that proceedings in a court of justice to determine the personal rights and obligations of parties over whom that court has no jurisdiction do not constitute due process of law. Whatever difficulty may be experienced in giving to those terms a definition which will embrace every permissible exertion of power affecting private rights, and exclude such as is forbidden, there can be no doubt of their meaning when applied to judicial proceedings. They then mean a course of legal proceedings according to those rules and principles which have been established in our systems of jurisprudence for the protection and enforcement of private rights. To give such proceedings any validity, there must be a tribunal competent by its constitution—that is, by the law of its creation—to pass upon the subject-matter of the suit; and, if that involves merely a determination of the personal liability of the defendant, he must be brought within its jurisdiction by service of process within the State, or his voluntary appearance.</p>

As stated by Cooley in his Treatise on Constitutional Limitations, 405, for any other purpose than to subject the property of a non-resident to valid claims against him in the State, “due process of law would require appearance or personal service before the defendant could be personally bound by any judgment rendered.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c076c6bf-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It follows from the views expressed that the personal judgment recovered in the State court of Oregon against the plaintiff herein, then a non-resident of the State, was without any validity, and did not authorize a sale of the property in controversy.</p>

The jurisdiction which every State possesses to determine the civil status and capacities of all its inhabitants involves authority to prescribe the conditions on which proceedings affecting them may be commenced and carried on within its territory. The State, for example, has absolute right to prescribe the conditions upon which the marriage relation between its own citizens shall be created, and the causes for which it may be dissolved. . . . </p>
<p id="c076c6c1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Neither do we mean to assert that a State may not require a non-resident entering into a partnership or association within its limits, or making contracts enforceable there, to appoint an agent or representative in the State to receive service of process and notice in legal proceedings instituted with respect to such partnership, association, or contracts, or to designate a place where such service may be made and notice given, and provide, upon their failure, to make such appointment or to designate such place that service may be made upon a public officer designated for that purpose, or <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="73" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page73">p. 73</span>in some other prescribed way, and that judgments rendered upon such service may not be binding upon the nonresidents both within and without the State. . . . Nor do we doubt that a State, on creating corporations or other institutions for pecuniary or charitable purposes, may provide a mode in which their conduct may be investigated, their obligations enforced, or their charters revoked, which shall require other than personal service upon their officers or members.

<p id="c076c6c7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Pennoyer</i> established fundamental jurisdictional doctrine, the main outlines of which prevailed for a century and which is still good law in many respects. <i>Pennoyer</i> proclaims that its holding rests on the Constitution, and the opinion mentions both the Due Process and the Full Faith and Credit Clauses. That assertion has two entailments.</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="c076ecd8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, because the Due Process Clause restricts the power of state governments, the boundaries of personal jurisdiction proclaimed by the Supreme Court bind state courts. (They also bind federal courts for an additional reason: Rule 4(k)(1)(A) provides that the personal jurisdiction of a federal court shall be the same as the court of a state in which the federal court is sitting, unless a federal statute provides otherwise.)</p></li>
<li><p id="c076ecd9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Pennoyer</i>’s mention of the Full Faith and Credit Clause (U.S. Const. Art. IV, §1) points to a second constitutional issue. The opinion links full faith and credit to personal jurisdiction: The courts of State <i>Y</i> need not enforce a judgment against a defendant entered by the courts of State <i>X</i> if <i>X</i> lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant.</p></li>
<li><p id="c076ecda-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Pennoyer</i> also makes, in passing, a point about the nature of appellate review in the U.S. legal system. Consider the sentence: “If these positions are sound, the ruling of the Circuit Court as to the invalidity of that judgment must be sustained, notwithstanding our dissent from the reasons upon which it was made.” Appellate courts in the United States review <i>outcomes</i>, not reasoning; because in the Supreme Court’s view the lower court had reached the correct outcome, it affirmed, even though it came to that outcome by an entirely different—and at the time novel—line of reasoning.</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c07713f3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As an example of the first problem, suppose a transaction much like that in <i>Pennoyer</i>: A New York purchaser buys a piece of property in Oregon. If title proves defective, could Purchaser sue Seller in New York? If Purchaser’s check bounces, could Oregon Seller sue Purchaser in Oregon? Unless distant parties can reliably resolve disputes, they will not deal with each other. How does <i>Pennoyer</i> answer these questions?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c07713f4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As an example of the second problem, imagine a world with the Full Faith and Credit Clause but without <i>Pennoyer</i>. Unscrupulous litigants in a distant state could file meritless complaints, recover default judgments, and then bring those judgments to the defendants’ home state for execution.

<li class=""><p id="c07713f8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Starting with the sentence (partway through the third paragraph of the edited opinion), “And that they are sound would seem to follow from two <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="75" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page75">p. 75</span>well-established principles. . . . ,” the opinion enunciates a series of broad categorical propositions: “every State possesses exclusive jurisdiction and sovereignty”; “no State can exercise direct jurisdiction and authority over persons or property without its territory”; “Any exertion of authority of this sort beyond this limit, is a mere nullity, and incapable of binding such persons or property in any other tribunals.”</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0773b0a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It thus becomes important both to recognize the conceptual structure implied by the extreme statements and then to understand how the opinion qualifies them.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class=""><p id="c0773b0b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Let us start with the conceptual structure, which the opinion describes in the lofty Latinate phrases that divide the world into two jurisdictional categories: <i>in personam</i> and <i>in rem.</i> The case assumes that jurisdiction is about power and that one can divide power into two apparently distinct categories—power over persons and power over property. Making that distinction implies that one could sensibly think about Oregon’s having power over Neff’s property (had it gone about acquiring it in the proper way) as a question separate from its having power over Neff himself. Power over Neff himself came to be known as jurisdiction <i>in personam</i> (over the person); power over his property came to be known as jurisdiction <i>in rem</i> (over the thing). Modern legal scholars doubt that the distinction holds up. The best critique appears in Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr., <i>A General Theory of State-Court Jurisdiction</i>, 1965 S. Ct. Rev. 241. As you will see, in recent years the Supreme Court has reconsidered this distinction.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0773b0c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>In personam</i> jurisdiction looks, at first, refreshingly simple, as described by <i>Pennoyer</i>. To obtain jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant the plaintiff must arrange to have defendant personally served with process within the borders of the state in question. So, in the hypothetical in Note 3, Purchaser could sue Seller in New York only if he could serve him with process in New York; otherwise Seller would be beyond the range of the New York court’s power. In <i>Pennoyer</i>’s view, serving Neff by other means (e.g., by mail) or by personal service in a different state does not work. Working with the facts of <i>Pennoyer</i>, explain why the Oregon court did not obtain <i>in personam</i> jurisdiction over Neff.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0773b0d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>In rem</i> jurisdiction, the more obscure category, flows from a problem created by the rules for <i>in personam</i> jurisdiction: People sometimes own property distant from their usual personal residence. In the hypothetical case in Note 3, suppose that, after Purchaser of the Oregon land returned to New York, the check bounced, and Seller argued that he still owns the property. Can Purchaser, by remaining out of state—perhaps indefinitely—prevent Oregon from giving clean title back to Seller (and thus enabling him to sell to a solvent purchaser)? If <i>in personam</i> jurisdiction were the only possibility, nothing could be done until Purchaser returned to Oregon and could be served with process. Unwilling to see that result, the court created a <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="76" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page76">p. 76</span>procedure by which a court located in the same state as the property could enter a judgment disposing of that property—by seizing it at the outset of the lawsuit. <i>Pennoyer</i> calls that procedure <i>in rem</i> jurisdiction. Working with the facts of <i>Pennoyer</i>, explain why the Oregon court did not obtain <i>in rem</i> jurisdiction over Neff.</p></li>

</li>
<li class=""><p id="c0773b0e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So far, so good in the world of concepts. The waters begin to cloud in the paragraph that begins “To prevent any misapplication. . . . ,” in which the opinion qualifies and retracts some of its broad statements. It does so in two ways:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0773b0f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It says that a state has jurisdiction over “the status of one of its citizens towards a non-resident.” What does that mean? The same paragraph tells us: it’s marriage and divorce. Without this paragraph Marcus Neff could abandon his wife in Oregon, move to another state, and leave her unable to obtain a divorce. The phrase just quoted suggests the hypothetical Mrs. Neff could obtain an Oregon divorce, because Oregon would have jurisdiction over her “status” as a married person, even if she could not locate or serve her husband in Oregon. In fact, courts wrestled with this situation for a century, wishing to allow abandoned spouses to obtain divorces, but not to allow abandoning spouses to move to another state and obtain a divorce without satisfying their obligations of support.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0773b10-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The next paragraph of the opinion says that states can require someone doing business there “to appoint an agent or representative in the State to receive service of process and notice in legal proceedings instituted with respect to such” business. By thus “consenting” to service of process one would, in the world of <i>Pennoyer,</i> consent to jurisdiction. In the wake of <i>Pennoyer</i> many states passed statutes requiring those doing business in the state to appoint an agent—often a state official—empowered to receive process on their behalf.</p></li>

The decade following <i>Pennoyer</i> saw enormous railroad construction. The last quarter of the nineteenth century also witnessed both a great expansion of industrial production and the proliferation of often interlocking corporations organizing that production. Within 50 years of the decision, other developments—the automobile, telegraph, and telephone—had nationalized economic life and even leisure activities in a way unforeseen by <i>Pennoyer</i>’s authors. As a consequence, many of the most difficult problems facing the courts after <i>Pennoyer</i> dealt with entities and situations to which <i>Pennoyer</i> only passingly alluded. Chief among those was the business corporation, a legal entity that could, through its employees, be “present” in many places at once.</p>

Ironically, the way out of the tangled path was suggested in a case involving not a corporation but a person. In Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U.S. 457 (1940), two partners in an oil well sued each other. Meyer, the defendant, had been a resident of Wyoming but at the time of the suit was served personally in Colorado; Meyer did not appear in Wyoming, where the court rendered a judgment against him. Meyer attacked the Wyoming judgment collaterally (does this sound a lot like <i>Pennoyer</i> so far?). The U.S. Supreme Court held that the Wyoming judgment was valid, and in a paragraph that laid the groundwork for much future law said:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c077b05c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Domicile in the state is alone sufficient to bring an absent defendant within the reach of the state’s jurisdiction for purposes of a personal judgment by means of appropriate substituted service. Substituted service [i.e., service other than personal service in the forum state] in such cases has been quite uniformly upheld where the absent defendant was served at his usual place of abode in the state as well as where he was personally served without the state. That such substituted service may be wholly adequate to meet the requirements of due process was recognized by this Court in <i>McDonald v. Mabee</i> despite earlier intimations to the contrary. See Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714. Its adequacy so far as due process is concerned is dependent on whether or not the form of substituted service provided for such cases and employed is reasonably calculated to give him actual notice of the proceedings and an opportunity to be heard. If it is, the traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice (<i>McDonald v. Mabee</i>, <i>supra</i>) implicit in due process are satisfied. Here there can be no question on that score. Meyer did not merely receive actual notice of the Wyoming proceedings. While outside the state, he was personally served in accordance with a statutory scheme which Wyoming had provided for such occasions. And in our view the machinery employed met all the requirements of due process. Certainly then Meyer’s domicile in Wyoming was a sufficient basis for that extraterritorial service. As in [the] case of the authority of the United States over its absent citizens, the authority of a state over one of its citizens is not terminated by the mere fact of his absence from the state. The state which accords him privileges and affords protection to him and his property by virtue of his domicile may also exact reciprocal duties. “Enjoyment of the privileges of residence within the state, and the attendant right to invoke the protection of its laws, are inseparable” from the various incidences of state citizenship. The responsibilities of that citizenship arise <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="79" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page79">p. 79</span>out of the relationship to the state which domicile creates. That relationship is not dissolved by mere absence from the state. The attendant duties, like the rights and privileges incident to domicile, are not dependent on continuous presence in the state. One such incidence of domicile is amenability to suit within the state even during sojourns without the state, where the state has provided and employed a reasonable method for apprising such an absent party of the proceedings against him.</p>

<p id="c077d773-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The questions for decision are (1) whether, within the limitations of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the appellant, a Delaware corporation, has by its activities in the State of Washington rendered itself amenable to proceedings in the courts of that state to recover unpaid contributions to the state unemployment compensation fund enacted by state statutes, Washington Unemployment Compensation Act, and (2) whether the state can exact those contributions consistently with the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="c077d774-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statutes in question set up a comprehensive scheme of unemployment compensation, the costs of which are defrayed by contributions required to be made by employers to a state unemployment compensation fund. The contributions are a specified percentage of the wages payable annually by each employer for his employees’ services in the state. The assessment and collection of the contributions and the fund are administered by appellees. Section 14(c) of the Act authorizes appellee Commissioner to issue an order and notice of assessment of delinquent contributions upon prescribed personal service of the notice upon the employer if found within the state, or, if not so found, by mailing the notice to the employer by registered mail at his last known address. . . . </p>
<p id="c077d775-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case notice of assessment for the years in question was personally served upon a sales solicitor employed by appellant in the State of Washington, and a copy of the notice was mailed by registered mail to appellant at its address in St. Louis, Missouri. Appellant appeared specially before the office of unemployment and moved to set aside the order and notice of assessment on the ground that the service upon appellant’s salesman was not proper service upon appellant; that appellant was not a corporation of the State of Washington and was not doing business within the state; that it had no agent within the state upon whom service could be made; and that appellant is not an employer and does not furnish employment within the meaning of the statute. . . . </p>
<p id="c077d776-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The facts as found by the appeal tribunal and accepted by the state Superior Court and Supreme Court, are not in dispute. Appellant is a Delaware corporation, having its principal place of business in St. Louis, Missouri, and is engaged in the <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="80" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page80">p. 80</span>manufacture and sale of shoes and other footwear. It maintains places of business in several states, other than Washington, at which its manufacturing is carried on and from which its merchandise is distributed interstate through several sales units or branches located outside the State of Washington.</p>
<p id="c077d777-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant has no office in Washington and makes no contracts either for sale or purchase of merchandise there. It maintains no stock of merchandise in that state and makes there no deliveries of goods in intrastate commerce. During the years from 1937 to 1940, now in question, appellant employed eleven to thirteen salesmen under direct supervision and control of sales managers located in St. Louis. These salesmen resided in Washington; their principal activities were confined to that state; and they were compensated by commissions based upon the amount of their sales. The commissions for each year totaled more than $31,000. Appellant supplies its salesmen with a line of samples, each consisting of one shoe of a pair, which they display to prospective purchasers. On occasion they rent permanent sample rooms, for exhibiting samples, in business buildings, or rent rooms in hotels or business buildings temporarily for that purpose. The cost of such rentals is reimbursed by appellant.</p>
<p id="c077d778-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The authority of the salesmen is limited to exhibiting their samples and soliciting orders from prospective buyers, at prices and on terms fixed by appellant. The salesmen transmit the orders to appellant’s office in St. Louis for acceptance or rejection, and when accepted the merchandise for filling the orders is shipped f.o.b. from points outside Washington to the purchasers within the state. All the merchandise shipped into Washington is invoiced at the place of shipment from which collections are made. No salesman has authority to enter into contracts or to make collections. . . . </p>
<p id="c077d779-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant. . . . insists that its activities within the state were not sufficient to. . . . [confer] jurisdiction. . . . And appellant further argues that since it was not present within the state, it is a denial of due process to subject it to taxation or other money exaction. It thus denies the power of the state to lay the tax or to subject appellant to a suit for its collection.</p>
<p id="c077d77a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Historically the jurisdiction of courts to render judgment in personam is grounded on their de facto power over the defendant’s person. Hence his presence within the territorial jurisdiction of a court was prerequisite to its rendition of a judgment personally binding him. <i>Pennoyer v. Neff</i>. But now that the capias ad respondendum has given way to personal service of summons or other form of notice, due process requires only that in order to subject a defendant to a judgment in personam, if he be not present within the territory of the forum, he have certain minimum contacts with it such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend “traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.” Since the corporate personality is a fiction, although a fiction intended to be acted upon as though it were a fact, it is clear that unlike an individual its “presence” without, as well as within, the state of its origin can be manifested only by activities carried on in its behalf by those who are authorized to act for it. To say that the corporation is so far “present” there as to satisfy due process requirements, for purposes of taxation or the maintenance of suits against it in the courts of the state, is to beg the question to be decided. For the terms “present” or “presence” are used merely to symbolize those activities of the corporation’s agent within the state which courts will deem to be sufficient to satisfy the demands of due process. Those demands may be met by such contacts of the corporation with the state of the forum as to make it reasonable, in the context of our federal <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="81" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page81">p. 81</span>system of government, to require the corporation to defend the particular suit which is brought there. An “estimate of the inconveniences” which would result to the corporation from a trial away from its “home” or principal place of business is relevant in this connection.</p>
<p id="c077d77b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Presence” in the state in this sense has never been doubted when the activities of the corporation there have not only been continuous and systematic, but also give rise to the liabilities sued on, even though no consent to be sued or authorization to an agent to accept service of process has been given. Conversely it has been generally recognized that the casual presence of the corporate agent or even his conduct of single or isolated items of activities in a state in the corporation’s behalf are not enough to subject it to suit on causes of action unconnected with the activities there. To require the corporation in such circumstances to defend the suit away from its home or other jurisdiction where it carries on more substantial activities has been thought to lay too great and unreasonable a burden on the corporation to comport with due process.</p>
<p id="c077d77c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While it has been held, in cases on which appellant relies, that continuous activity of some sorts within a state is not enough to support the demand that the corporation be amenable to suits unrelated to that activity, there have been instances in which the continuous corporate operations within a state were thought so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit against it on causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those activities.</p>
<p id="c077d77d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, although the commission of some single or occasional acts of the corporate agent in a state sufficient to impose an obligation or liability on the corporation has not been thought to confer upon the state authority to enforce it, other such acts, because of their nature and quality and the circumstances of their commission, may be deemed sufficient to render the corporation liable to suit. True, some of the decisions holding the corporation amenable to suit have been supported by resort to the legal fiction that it has given its consent to service and suit, consent being implied from its presence in the state through the acts of its authorized agents. But more realistically it may be said that those authorized acts were of such a nature as to justify the fiction.</p>
<p id="c077d77e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is evident that the criteria by which we mark the boundary line between those activities which justify the subjection of a corporation to suit, and those which do not, cannot be simply mechanical or quantitative. The test is not merely, as has sometimes been suggested, whether the activity, which the corporation has seen fit to procure through its agents in another state, is a little more or a little less. Whether due process is satisfied must depend rather upon the quality and nature of the activity in relation to the fair and orderly administration of the laws which it was the purpose of the due process clause to insure. That clause does not contemplate that a state may make binding a judgment in personam against an individual or corporate defendant with which the state has no contacts, ties, or relations.</p>
<p id="c077d77f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But to the extent that a corporation exercises the privilege of conducting activities within a state, it enjoys the benefits and protection of the laws of that state. The exercise of that privilege may give rise to obligations, and, so far as those obligations arise out of or are connected with the activities within the state, a procedure which requires the corporation to respond to a suit brought to enforce them can, in most instances, hardly be said to be undue.</p>
<p id="c077fe90-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying these standards, the activities carried on in behalf of appellant in the State of Washington were neither irregular nor casual. They were systematic and continuous <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="82" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page82">p. 82</span>throughout the years in question. They resulted in a large volume of interstate business, in the course of which appellant received the benefits and protection of the laws of the state, including the right to resort to the courts for the enforcement of its rights. The obligation which is here sued upon arose out of those very activities. It is evident that these operations establish sufficient contacts or ties with the state of the forum to make it reasonable and just, according to our traditional conception of fair play and substantial justice, to permit the state to enforce the obligations which appellant has incurred there. Hence we cannot say that the maintenance of the present suit in the State of Washington involves an unreasonable or undue procedure.</p>
<p id="c077fe91-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are likewise unable to conclude that the service of the process within the state upon an agent whose activities establish appellant’s “presence” there was not sufficient notice of the suit, or that the suit was so unrelated to those activities as to make the agent an inappropriate vehicle for communicating the notice. It is enough that appellant has established such contacts with the state that the particular form of substituted service adopted there gives reasonable assurance that the notice will be actual. Nor can we say that the mailing of the notice of suit to appellant by registered mail at its home office was not reasonably calculated to apprise appellant of the suit. . . . </p>
<p id="c077fe92-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant having rendered itself amenable to suit upon obligations arising out of the activities of its salesmen in Washington, the state may maintain the present suit in personam to collect the tax laid upon the exercise of the privilege of employing appellant’s salesmen within the state. For Washington has made one of those activities, which taken together establish appellant’s “presence” there for purposes of suit, the taxable event by which the state brings appellant within the reach of its taxing power. The state thus has constitutional power to lay the tax and to subject appellant to a suit to recover it. The activities which establish its “presence” subject it alike to taxation by the state and to suit to recover the tax.</p>

<p id="c077fe95-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I believe that the Federal Constitution leaves to each State, without any “ifs” or “buts,” a power to tax and to open the doors of its courts for its citizens to sue corporations whose agents do business in those States. Believing that the Constitution gave the States that power, I think it a judicial deprivation to condition its exercise upon this Court’s notion of “fair play,” however appealing that term may be. Nor can I stretch the meaning of due process so far as to authorize this Court to deprive a State of the right to afford judicial protection to its citizens on the ground that it would be more “convenient” for the corporation to be sued somewhere else.</p>
<p id="c077fe96-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is a strong emotional appeal in the words “fair play” “justice,” and “reasonableness.” But they were not chosen by those who wrote the original Constitution or the Fourteenth Amendment as a measuring rod for this Court to use in invalidating State or Federal laws passed by elected legislative representatives. No one, not even those who most feared a democratic government, ever formally proposed that courts should be given power to invalidate legislation under any such elastic standards. . . . </p>
<p id="c077fe97-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">True, the State’s power is here upheld. But the rule announced means that tomorrow’s judgment may strike down a State or Federal enactment on the ground that it does not conform to the Court’s idea of natural justice. . . . </p>

One commentator has suggested that the basic test of <i>International Shoe</i> is a good one but that because of its generality it must be subjected to a process of “arbitrary particularization” in order to come up with workable rules. Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr., <i>A General Theory of State-Court Jurisdiction</i>, 1965 Sup. Ct. Rev. 241, 283.

<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0784ccd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>General jurisdiction.</i> In some cases the defendant will have such substantial contacts with the forum state to make it fair to assert jurisdiction even over claims unrelated to those contacts. For example, suppose an individual is a resident of California. She could be sued in California even over contracts or torts concluded or committed in other states or nations. Likewise, take a corporation like Microsoft, which has its chief place of business in Washington State. Under the theory of general jurisdiction, Microsoft could be sued in Washington even over contracts or torts concluded or committed in Idaho or Germany. As <i>Daimler AG v. Bauman</i> (infra page 133) put it, “A court may assert general jurisdiction over foreign (sister-state or foreign-country) corporations to hear any and all claims against them when their affiliations with the State are so ’continuous and systematic’ as to render them essentially at home in the forum State.” Later in this chapter we return to the question of general jurisdiction; for now, keep in mind the basic proposition that every individual and business entity in the United States has at least one state where they can be sued on any claim. To use the language of <i>Daimler</i>, an individual will be “at home” (and thus amenable to suit on all claims) in the state of her domicile. Corporations will similarly be “at home” both in the state of their incorporation and in the state that is their principal place of business (if that differs from their state of incorporation). In later cases, we will consider where <i>else</i> they can be sued.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0784cce-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Specific jurisdiction</i>. Where the defendant’s activities fall short of general jurisdiction, the minimum contacts analysis of <i>International Shoe</i> becomes important. In those cases courts worry both about the extent of those contacts and about the relation between defendants’ contacts with the state and the claim on which plaintiff is suing. Suppose, for example, Driver has never been in Missouri but, in the course of a vacation, enters the state, and injures a pedestrian. Specific jurisdiction would allow the injured pedestrian to sue Driver in Missouri on a claim arising from that accident—but <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="86" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page86">p. 86</span>not on other, unrelated claims. As the <i>Daimler</i> Court put it, “<i>International Shoe</i> recognized, as well, that ’the commission of some single or occasional acts of the corporate agent in a state’ may sometimes be enough to subject the corporation to jurisdiction in that State’s tribunals with respect to suits relating to that in-state activity.” Commentators describe such cases as instances of specific jurisdiction, in which jurisdiction exists for the specific claim in question but not necessarily for other claims. In the decades following <i>International Shoe,</i> courts tried to work out its application to varying factual patterns. In particular, they wrestled with the question of whether the holding of <i>International Shoe</i> provided any limits: Was every defendant (at least every business defendant) subject to jurisdiction anywhere it did any business? Two cases decided by the Supreme Court about a decade after <i>International Shoe</i> gave contrasting answers to that question. Both are still frequently cited and present paradigmatic instances of the issues that arise in applying <i>International Shoe</i>.</p></li>

<p id="c07873e4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The material facts are relatively simple. In 1944, Lowell Franklin, a resident of California, purchased a life insurance policy from [an insurer subsequently bought by respondent, which] then mailed a reinsurance certificate to Franklin in California offering to insure him. . . . He accepted this offer and from that time until his death in 1950 paid premiums by mail from his California home to respondent’s Texas office. [When the beneficiary notified International Life of Franklin’s death,] it refused to pay, claiming that he had committed suicide[, a cause of death excluded by the policy]. It appears that neither [the original insurer] nor respondent has ever had any office or agent in California. . . . </p>
<p id="c07873e5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Looking back over this long history of [jurisdiction cases] a trend is clearly discernible toward expanding the permissible scope of state jurisdiction over foreign corporations and other nonresidents. In part this is attributable to the fundamental transformation of our national economy. . . . With this increasing nationalization of commerce has come a great increase in the amount of business conducted by mail across state lines. At the same time modern transportation and communication have made it much less burdensome for a party sued to defend himself in a State where he engages in economic activity. Turning to this case we think it apparent that the Due Process Clause did not preclude the California court from entering a judgment binding on respondent. It is sufficient for purposes of due process that the suit was based on a contract which had substantial connection with that State. The contract was delivered in California, the premiums were mailed from there and the insured was a resident of that State when he died. It cannot be denied that California has a manifest interest in providing effective means of redress for its residents when their insurers refuse to pay claims. These residents would be at a severe disadvantage if they were forced to follow the insurance company to a distant State in order to hold it <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="87" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page87">p. 87</span>legally accountable. . . . There is no contention that respondent did not have adequate notice of the suit or sufficient time to prepare its defenses and appear.</p>

When she created the trust, she lived in Pennsylvania, but the trust was created in Delaware, with a Delaware bank as trustee. After creating the trust she moved to Florida, and later died there. Her will was probated in Florida. The case concerns whether the Florida court could obtain jurisdiction over the trust. That issue turned on whether Florida could acquire jurisdiction over the Delaware trustee. If Florida had jurisdiction, two daughters received everything, and a third daughter got nothing.

In response to these changes, the requirements for personal jurisdiction over nonresidents have evolved from the rigid rule of <i>Pennoyer v. Neff</i> to the flexible standard of <i>International Shoe Co. v. Washington</i>. But it is a mistake to assume that this trend heralds the eventual demise of all restrictions on the personal jurisdiction of state courts. Those restrictions are more than a guarantee of immunity from inconvenient or distant litigation. They are a consequence of territorial limitations on the power of the respective States. However minimal the burden of defending in a foreign tribunal, a defendant may not be called upon to do so unless he has had the “minimal contacts” with that State that are a prerequisite to its exercise of power over him. See <i>International Shoe Co. v. Washington</i>.</p>
<p id="c0789afd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We fail to find such contacts in the circumstances of this case.

<p id="c078c217-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>International Shoe</i> provided a new framework for thinking about <i>in personam</i> jurisdiction over corporations. But the case left open other jurisdictional questions.</p>
<p id="c078c218-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>International Shoe</i> involved a corporate defendant (as did many of the most difficult jurisdictional questions), and it therefore did not discuss the applicability of its approach to jurisdiction over individuals. The second issue left untouched by <i>International Shoe</i> was <i>in rem</i> and <i>quasi in rem</i> jurisdiction. Under the line of cases descended from <i>Pennoyer</i>, the presence of property in the forum state could be the basis for jurisdiction over claims of any sort.</p>
<p id="c078c219-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here it makes sense to pause and offer a note on terminology. Some courts—like the <i>Pennoyer</i> Court—use <i>in rem</i> to describe all cases in which property is used as the basis for jurisdiction. Other courts distinguish between <i>in rem</i> and <i>quasi in rem</i> jurisdiction. They use the former term to describe cases in which ownership of the property itself is at stake: Does <i>X</i> own Blackacre? Such courts use <i>quasi in rem</i> to describe cases in which the property is used only as a jurisdictional hook to allow the litigation of a claim not related to that property. In this stricter terminology <i>Pennoyer</i> itself was a <i>quasi in rem</i> case; Mitchell was not claiming that he rather than Neff owned the property in question; he was instead trying to use the property as the basis for Oregon’s jurisdiction over his claim for an unpaid legal fee.</p>
<p id="c078c21a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While it lasted, <i>quasi in rem</i> jurisdiction created some strange doctrinal possibilities. The most unexpected elaboration of this branch of <i>Pennoyer</i> came in a series of cases holding that plaintiffs could obtain jurisdiction by seizing not only tangible property—land and chattels—but also debts owed to the defendant. Harris v. Balk, 198 U.S. 215 (1905), is probably the most bizarre of this line of cases. Harris owed Balk money, and Balk owed Epstein money; Balk lived in North Carolina, Epstein in Maryland. Harris journeyed from North Carolina to Maryland. While Harris was in Maryland, Epstein had him served with process, and a Maryland court entered a judgment saying that Harris should pay the money he owed Balk to <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="89" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page89">p. 89</span>Epstein instead. Balk challenged the Maryland court’s power to enter this judgment (arguing that only personal service on him in Maryland would have justified such a judgment), but the Supreme Court upheld it. The consequence of <i>Harris</i> was that a state could acquire jurisdiction over persons whenever their debtors were present in that state by “attaching” the debts. The result was to make creditors liable (to the extent of amounts owed them) in any state in which their debtors set foot.</p>
<p id="c078c21b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under <i>Harris</i>’s extension of <i>Pennoyer</i>, for example, if Alfred Manhattanite had lent money to his friend Jane Gotham and she took a trip to Florida, that state had the power to enter a judgment directing Jane to pay someone besides Alfred the money she owed him—if Jane’s debt to Alfred were “attached” during her visit.</p>
<p id="c078c21c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lurking behind these somewhat extreme results was an undiscussed circumstance: <i>In rem</i> jurisdiction provided an escape from the results yielded by <i>Pennoyer</i>’s somewhat restrictive doctrines. To the extent, then, that <i>International Shoe</i> provided a more sensible way of thinking about <i>in personam</i> jurisdiction, one might not need <i>quasi in rem</i> jurisdiction—at least not in its more extravagant applications.</p>
<p id="c078e92d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These two themes—the applicability of <i>International Shoe</i> to individuals and the role of <i>in rem</i> jurisdiction—came together in <i>Shaffer v. Heitner</i>, the most important jurisdictional case after <i>International Shoe</i>.</p>

<p id="c078e933-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many U.S. businesses take the form of corporations. A corporation is an entity, typically chartered under the laws of a state. For a business, the corporate form has some advantages: It can outlast the lives of individual owners; it can make it easier to raise capital (by selling shares); it can insulate its owners from personal liability (the corporation, rather than individual shareholders, is liable for corporate obligations). It also has some disadvantages: Many states as well as the federal government impose taxes on corporations as well as their shareholders; and the corporation must comply with whatever regulations the chartering state imposes.</p>
<p id="c078e934-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the United States, many substantial corporations have chosen Delaware as their state of incorporation.

<p id="c078e935-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One such matter involves the fiduciary obligations of corporate directors. The members of the board of directors of a corporation owe it fiduciary obligations: The law requires directors to prudently conduct the affairs of the corporation—monitoring its financial and other affairs; hiring and firing its officers, who conduct day-to-day operations; and directing or overseeing major decisions of the corporation.</p>
<p id="c078e936-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Like trustees, directors can be sued by their beneficiaries. But because the corporation is the beneficiary and is controlled by the directors, the prospect of such a suit to enforce the directors’ fiduciary duties is nil—unless a representative of the corporation who is independent of the directors may sue. American law has developed such a procedure, called the shareholder’s derivative suit. In a derivative action, a shareholder steps forward and sues the directors or officers in the name of the corporation, alleging some breach of fiduciary duty. If the suit is successful, the proceeds go to the corporation. Such suits have spawned numerous complex issues of procedural and corporate law as well as a good deal of controversy.</p>

So far as the record shows, none of the certificates representing the seized property was physically present in Delaware.

<p id="c0791055-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Delaware courts rejected appellants’ jurisdictional challenge by noting that this suit was brought as a quasi in rem proceeding. Since quasi in rem jurisdiction is traditionally based on attachment or seizure of property present in the jurisdiction, not on contacts between the defendant and the State, the courts considered appellants’ claimed lack of contacts with Delaware to be unimportant. This categorical analysis assumes the continued soundness of the conceptual structure founded on the century-old case of <i>Pennoyer v. Neff</i>.</p>
<p id="c0791056-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="92" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page92">p. 92</span>[The Court discussed the development of jurisdictional ideas from the time of <i>Pennoyer v. Neff</i>. In reviewing <i>International Shoe</i> itself the opinion explained in footnote 19 that “the <i>International Shoe</i> court believed that the standard it was setting forth governed actions against natural persons as well as corporations, and we see no reason to disagree. The differences between individuals and corporations may, of course, lead to the conclusion that a given set of circumstances establishes State jurisdiction over one type of defendant but not over the other.” The note cited <i>McGee v. International Life</i> as a “see also” citation for this proposition.] [T]he relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation, rather than the mutually exclusive sovereignty of the States on which the rules of <i>Pennoyer</i> rest, became the central concern of the inquiry into personal jurisdiction.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN105CE_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N105CE_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">20</a></span> The immediate effect of this departure from <i>Pennoyer</i>’s conceptual apparatus was to increase the ability of the state courts to obtain personal jurisdiction over nonresident defendants.</p>
<p id="c0791058-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No equally dramatic change has occurred in the law governing jurisdiction in rem. There have, however, been intimations that the collapse of the in personam wing of <i>Pennoyer</i> has not left that decision unweakened as a foundation for in rem jurisdiction.

<p id="c0791059-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is clear, therefore, that the law of state-court jurisdiction no longer stands securely on the foundation established in <i>Pennoyer</i>. We think that the time is ripe to consider whether the standard of fairness and substantial justice set forth in <i>International Shoe</i> should be held to govern actions in rem as well as in personam.</p>

<p id="c079105b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case for applying to jurisdiction in rem the same test of “fair play and substantial justice” as governs assertions of jurisdiction in personam is simple and straightforward. It is premised on recognition that “[t]he phrase, ’judicial jurisdiction over a thing,’ is a customary elliptical way of referring to jurisdiction over the interests of persons in a thing.” Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws §56, introductory note. This recognition leads to the conclusion that in order to justify an exercise of jurisdiction in rem, the basis for jurisdiction must be sufficient to justify exercising “jurisdiction over the interests of persons in a thing.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN105F6_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N105F6_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">23</a></span> The standard for determining whether an exercise of jurisdiction over the interests of persons is consistent with the Due Process Clause is the minimum contacts standard elucidated in <i>International Shoe</i>.</p>
<p id="c079105d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This argument, of course, does not ignore the fact that the presence of property in a State may bear on the existence of jurisdiction by providing contacts among the forum State, the defendant, and the litigation. For example, when claims to the property itself <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="93" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page93">p. 93</span>are the source of the underlying controversy between the plaintiff and the defendant, it would be unusual for the State where the property is located not to have jurisdiction. In such cases, the defendant’s claim to property located in the State would normally indicate that he expected to benefit from the State’s protection of his interest. The State’s strong interests in assuring the marketability of property within its borders and in providing a procedure for peaceful resolution of disputes about the possession of that property would also support jurisdiction, as would the likelihood that important records and witnesses will be found in the State.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10605_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10605_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">28</a></span> The presence of property may also favor jurisdiction in cases, such as suits for injury suffered on the land of an absentee owner, where the defendant’s ownership of the property is conceded but the cause of action is otherwise related to rights and duties growing out of that ownership.</p>
<p id="c079376f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It appears, therefore, that jurisdiction over many types of actions which now are or might be brought in rem would not be affected by a holding that any assertion of state-court jurisdiction must satisfy the <i>International Shoe</i> standard. For the type of quasi in rem action typified by <i>Harris v. Balk</i> and the present case, however, accepting the proposed analysis would result in significant change. These are cases where the property which now serves as the basis for state-court jurisdiction is completely unrelated to the plaintiff’s cause of action. Thus, although the presence of the defendant’s property in a State might suggest the existence of other ties among the defendant, the State, and the litigation, the presence of the property alone would not support the State’s jurisdiction. . . . </p>
<p id="c0793770-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since acceptance of the <i>International Shoe</i> test would most affect this class of cases, we examine the arguments against adopting that standard as they relate to this category of litigation. Before doing so, however, we note that this type of case also presents the clearest illustration of the argument in favor of assessing assertions of jurisdiction by a single standard. For in cases such as <i>Harris</i> and this one, the only role played by the property is to provide the basis for bringing the defendant into court. Indeed, the express purpose of the Delaware sequestration procedure is to compel the defendant to enter a personal appearance. In such cases, if a direct assertion of personal jurisdiction over the defendant would violate the Constitution, it would seem that an indirect assertion of the jurisdiction should be equally impermissible.</p>
<p id="c0793771-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The primary rationale for treating the presence of property as a sufficient basis for jurisdiction to adjudicate claims over which the State would not have jurisdiction if <i>International Shoe</i> applied is that a wrongdoer “should not be able to avoid payment of his obligations by the expedient of removing his assets to a place where he is not subject to an in personam suit.” Restatement §66, Comment a. This justification, however, does not explain why jurisdiction should be recognized without regard to whether the property is present in the State because of an effort to avoid the owner’s obligations. Nor does it support jurisdiction to adjudicate the underlying claim. . . . </p>
<p id="c0793772-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It might also be suggested that allowing in rem jurisdiction avoids the uncertainty inherent in the <i>International Shoe</i> standard and assures a plaintiff of a forum.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1062F_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N1062F_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">37</a></span>. . . . [W]hen the existence of jurisdiction in a particular forum under <i>International Shoe</i> <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="94" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page94">p. 94</span>is unclear, the cost of simplifying the litigation by avoiding the jurisdictional question may be the sacrifice of “fair play and substantial justice.” That cost is too high.</p>
<p id="c0793774-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are left, then, to consider the significance of the long history of jurisdiction based solely on the presence of property in a State. . . . “[T]raditional notions of fair play and substantial justice” can be as readily offended by the perpetuation of ancient forms that are no longer justified as by the adoption of new procedures that are inconsistent with the basic values of our constitutional heritage. The fiction that an assertion of jurisdiction over property is anything but an assertion of jurisdiction over the owner of the property supports an ancient form without substantial modern justification. Its continued acceptance would serve only to allow state court jurisdiction that is fundamentally unfair to the defendant.</p>
<p id="c0793775-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We therefore conclude that all assertions of state court jurisdiction must be evaluated according to the standards set forth in <i>International Shoe</i> and its progeny.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10649_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10649_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">39</a></span></p>

<p id="c0793778-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Delaware courts based their assertion of jurisdiction in this case solely on the statutory presence of appellants’ property in Delaware. Yet that property is not the subject matter of this litigation, nor is the underlying cause of action related to the property. Appellants’ holdings in Greyhound do not, therefore, provide contacts with Delaware sufficient to support the jurisdiction of that State’s courts over appellants. If it exists, that jurisdiction must have some other foundation.</p>
<p id="c0793779-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellee Heitner did not allege and does not now claim that appellants have ever set foot in Delaware. Nor does he identify any act related to his cause of action as having taken place in Delaware. Nevertheless, he contends that appellants’ positions as directors and officers of a corporation chartered in Delaware provide sufficient “contacts, ties, or relations,” <i>International Shoe Co. v. Washington</i>, with that State to give its courts jurisdiction over appellants in this stockholder’s derivative action. This argument is based primarily on what Heitner asserts to be the strong interest of Delaware in supervising the management of a Delaware corporation. That interest is said to derive from the role of Delaware law in establishing the corporation and defining the obligations owed to it by its officers and directors. In order to protect this interest, appellee concludes, Delaware’s courts must have jurisdiction over corporate fiduciaries such as appellants.</p>
<p id="c079377a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This argument is undercut by the failure of the Delaware Legislature to assert the state interest appellee finds so compelling. Delaware law bases jurisdiction not on appellants’ status as corporate fiduciaries, but rather on the presence of their property in the State. Although the sequestration procedure used here may be most frequently used in derivative suits against officers and directors, the authorizing statute evinces no specific concern with such actions. Sequestration can be used in any suit against a nonresident, and reaches corporate fiduciaries only if they happen to own interests in a Delaware corporation, or other property in the State. But as Heitner’s failure to secure jurisdiction over seven of the defendants named in his complaint demonstrates, there is no necessary relationship between holding a position as a corporate fiduciary and owning stock or <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="95" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page95">p. 95</span>other interests in the corporation. If Delaware perceived its interest in securing jurisdiction over corporate fiduciaries to be as great as Heitner suggests, we would expect it to have enacted a statute more clearly designed to protect that interest. . . . </p>
<p id="c079377b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellee suggests that by accepting positions as officers or directors of a Delaware corporation, appellants performed the acts required by <i>Hanson v. Denckla</i>. He notes that Delaware law provides substantial benefits to corporate officers and directors, and that these benefits were at least in part the incentive for appellants to assume their positions. It is, he says, “only fair and just” to require appellants, in return for these benefits, to respond in the State of Delaware when they are accused of misusing their powers.</p>
<p id="c079377c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But like Heitner’s first argument, this line of reasoning establishes only that it is appropriate for Delaware law to govern the obligations of appellants to Greyhound and its stockholders. It does not demonstrate that appellants have “purposefully avail[ed themselves] of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State,” <i>Hanson v. Denckla</i>, in a way that would justify bringing them before a Delaware tribunal. Appellants have simply had nothing to do with the State of Delaware. Moreover, appellants had no reason to expect to be haled before a Delaware court. Delaware, unlike some States, has not enacted a statute that treats acceptance of a directorship as consent to jurisdiction in the State. And “[i]t strains reason. . . . to suggest that anyone buying securities in a corporation formed in Delaware ’impliedly consents’ to subject himself to Delaware’s. . . . jurisdiction on any cause of action.” Appellants, who were not required to acquire interests in Greyhound in order to hold their positions, did not by acquiring those interests surrender their right to be brought to judgment only in States with which they had “minimum contacts.” The Due Process Clause “does not contemplate that a state may make binding a judgment. . . . against an individual or corporate defendant with which the state has no contacts, ties, or relations.” <i>International Shoe Co. v. Washington</i>. Delaware’s assertion of jurisdiction over appellants in this case is inconsistent with that constitutional limitation on state power. The judgment of the Delaware Supreme Court must, therefore, be reversed.</p>

I also agree that neither the statutory presence of appellants’ stock in Delaware nor their positions as directors and officers of a Delaware corporation can provide sufficient contacts to support the Delaware courts’ assertion of jurisdiction in this case.</p>
<p id="c0795e91-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I would explicitly reserve judgment, however, on whether the ownership of some forms of property whose situs is indisputably and permanently located within a State may, without more, provide the contacts necessary to subject a defendant to jurisdiction within the State to the extent of the value of the property. In the case of real property, in particular, preservation of the common law concept of quasi in rem jurisdiction arguably would avoid the uncertainty of the general <i>International Shoe</i> standard without significant cost to “traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.” Subject to that reservation, I join the opinion of the Court.</p>

As a practical matter, the Delaware sequestration statute created an unacceptable risk of judgment without notice. . . . I therefore agree with the Court that on the record before us no adequate basis for jurisdiction exists and that the Delaware statute is unconstitutional on its face.</p>
<p id="c0795e95-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How the Court’s opinion may be applied in other contexts is not entirely clear to me. . . . My uncertainty as to the reach of the opinion, and my fear that it purports to decide a great deal more than is necessary to dispose of this case, persuade me merely to concur in the judgment.</p>
<p id="c0795e96-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span class="epub-small-caps">Brennan, J.,</span> concurring and dissenting.</p>
<p id="c0795e97-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I join Parts I-III of the Court’s opinion. I fully agree that the minimum contacts analysis developed in <i>International Shoe Co. v. Washington</i> represents a far more sensible construct for the exercise of state court jurisdiction than the patchwork of legal and factual fictions that has been generated from the decision in <i>Pennoyer v. Neff.</i> It is precisely because the inquiry into minimum contacts is now of such overriding importance, however, that I must respectfully dissent from Part IV of the Court’s opinion. . . . </p>
<p id="c0795e98-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I, therefore, would approach the minimum contacts analysis differently than does the Court. Crucial to me is the fact that appellants voluntarily associated themselves with the State of Delaware, “invoking the benefits and protections of its laws,” <i>Hanson v. Denckla</i>; <i>International Shoe Co. v. Washington</i>, by entering into a long term and fragile relationship with one of its domestic corporations. They thereby elected to assume powers and to undertake responsibilities wholly derived from that State’s rules and regulations, and to become eligible for those benefits that Delaware law makes available to its corporations’ officials. E.g., 8 Del. C. §§143 (interest-free loans); 145 (indemnification). While it is possible that countervailing issues of judicial efficiency and the like might clearly favor a different forum, they do not appear on the meager record before us; and, of course, we are concerned solely with “minimum” contacts, not the “best” contacts. I thus do not believe that it is unfair to insist that appellants make themselves available to suit in a competent forum that Delaware might create for vindication of its important public policies directly pertaining to appellants’ fiduciary associations with the State.</p>

After the decision in <i>Shaffer</i>, the Delaware legislature enacted a statute purporting to give its courts jurisdiction over officers and directors of Delaware corporations in cases related to their corporate activities. See 10 Del. Code §3114. The Delaware Supreme Court upheld the statute against constitutional attack in Armstrong v. Pomerance, 423 A.2d 174 (Del. 1980).

<p id="c07985bf-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>In rem</i> jurisdiction, an old idea, and the Internet, a newer one, have come together in an interesting way. Like other trademarks, Internet domain names are valuable pieces of intellectual property, and legislation protects them from various sorts of abuse and poaching. Because of the ease of registering a domain name and the ubiquity of the Internet, plaintiffs seeking to protect domain names sometimes have difficulty in locating the defendant. Even if the defendant’s whereabouts are known, the defendant may not be subject to personal jurisdiction in the United States. Congress responded with the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (15 U.S.C. §1125(d)(2) (2011)), whose procedural portions exploit the architecture of the Internet and the concept of <i>in rem</i> jurisdiction. Individual computers connected to the Internet have numerical addresses. But long strings of numbers are more difficult to remember than, for example, google.com, so the Internet uses a domain name system, which is a table of names associated with computer addresses. Whenever an Internet user requests a domain name site by typing its name in a browser, its numerical address has to be matched with a number by searching a list acquired from directory computers that maintain lists matching site names with numerical <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="99" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page99">p. 99</span>addresses. The domain name registrar keeps the most current tables matching names and numbers. The registrar thus functions both as a keeper of title records and as a continually updated directory that facilitates the matching process that allows the Internet to function.</p>

(Seaway) in Massena, N.Y., in 1976. The following year the Robinson family, who resided in New York, left that State for a new home in Arizona. As they passed through the State of Oklahoma, another car struck their Audi in the rear, causing a fire which severely burned Kay Robinson and her two children.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10829_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10829_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">1</a></span> The Robinsons subsequently brought a products-liability action in the District Court for Creek County, Okla. claiming that their injuries resulted from defective design and placement of the Audi’s gas tank and fuel system. They joined as defendants the automobile’s manufacturer, Audi NSU Auto Union Aktiengesellschaft (Audi); its importer, Volkswagen of America, Inc. (Volkswagen); its regional distributor, petitioner World-Wide Volkswagen Corporation (World-Wide); and its retail dealer, petitioner Seaway. Seaway and World-Wide entered special appearances,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1082F_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N1082F_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">3</a></span> claiming that Oklahoma’s exercise of jurisdiction over them would offend the limitations on the State’s jurisdiction imposed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="c079d3f8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The facts presented to the District Court showed that World-Wide is incorporated and has its business office in New York. It distributes vehicles, parts and accessories, under contract with Volkswagen, to retail dealers in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Seaway, one of these retail dealers, is incorporated and has its place of business in New York. Insofar as the record reveals, Seaway and World-Wide are fully independent corporations whose relations with each other and with Volkswagen and Audi are contractual only. Respondents adduced no evidence that either World-Wide or Seaway does any business in Oklahoma, ships or sells any products to or in that State, has an agent to receive process there, or purchases advertisements in any media calculated to reach Oklahoma. In fact, as respondents’ counsel conceded at oral argument, there was no showing that any automobile sold by World-Wide or <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="101" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page101">p. 101</span>Seaway has ever entered Oklahoma with the single exception of the vehicle involved in the present case. . . . </p>

<p id="c079d3fb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the case before us, the product being sold and distributed by the petitioners is by its very design and purpose so mobile that petitioners can foresee its possible use in Oklahoma.

<p id="c079d3fe-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . As has long been settled, and as we reaffirm today, a state court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant only so long as there exist “minimum contacts” between the defendant and the forum State. <i>International Shoe Co. v. Washington</i>. The concept of minimum contacts, in turn, can be seen to perform two related, but distinguishable functions. It protects the defendant against the burdens of litigating in a distant or inconvenient forum. And it acts to ensure that the States, through their courts, do not reach out beyond the limits imposed on them by their status as coequal sovereigns in a federal system.</p>
<p id="c079d3ff-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The protection against inconvenient litigation is typically described in terms of “reasonableness” or “fairness.” We have said that the defendant’s contacts with the forum State must be such that maintenance of the suit “does not offend ’traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.’” <i>International Shoe Co. v. Washington</i>, quoting <i>Milliken v. Meyer</i>. The relationship between the defendant and the forum must be such that it is “reasonable  . . . to require the corporation to defend the particular suit which is brought there.” Implicit in this emphasis on reasonableness is the understanding that the burden on the defendant, while always a primary concern, will in an appropriate case be considered in light of other relevant factors, including the forum State’s interest in adjudicating the dispute; the plaintiff’s interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief, at least when that interest is not adequately protected by the plaintiff’s power to choose the forum, cf. <i>Shaffer v. Heitner</i>; the interstate judicial system’s interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies; and <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="102" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page102">p. 102</span>the shared interest of the several States in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.</p>
<p id="c079d400-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The limits imposed on state jurisdiction by the Due Process Clause, in its role as a guarantor against inconvenient litigation, have been substantially relaxed over the years. As we noted in <i>McGee v. International Life Ins. Co</i>., this trend is largely attributable to a fundamental transformation in the American economy. . . . </p>
<p id="c079d401-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The historical developments noted in <i>McGee,</i> of course, have only accelerated in the generation since that case was decided. Nevertheless, we have never accepted the proposition that state lines are irrelevant for jurisdictional purposes, nor could we and remain faithful to the principles of interstate federalism embodied in the Constitution. The economic interdependence of the States was foreseen and desired by the Framers. In the Commerce Clause, they provided that the Nation was to be a common market, a “free trade unit” in which the States are debarred from acting as separable economic entities. But the Framers also intended that the States retain many essential attributes of sovereignty, including, in particular, the sovereign power to try causes in their courts.</p>
<p id="c079d402-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The sovereignty of each State, in turn, implied a limitation on the sovereignty of all of its sister States—a limitation express or implicit in both the original scheme of the Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment. . . . </p>
<p id="c079d403-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, the Due Process Clause “does not contemplate that a state may make binding a judgment in personam against an individual or corporate defendant with which the state has no contacts, ties, or relations.” <i>International Shoe Co. v. Washington</i>. Even if the defendant would suffer minimal or no inconvenience from being forced to litigate before the tribunals of another State; even if the forum State has a strong interest in applying its law to the controversy; even if the forum State is the most convenient location for litigation, the Due Process Clause, acting as an instrument of interstate federalism, may sometimes act to divest the State of its power to render a valid judgment. <i>Hanson v. Denckla</i>.</p>

<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c079fa14-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">III</p></div>
<p id="c079fa15-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying these principles to the case at hand, we find in the record before us a total absence of those affiliating circumstances that are a necessary predicate to any exercise of state-court jurisdiction. Petitioners carry on no activity whatsoever in Oklahoma. They close no sales and perform no services there. They avail themselves of none of the privileges and benefits of Oklahoma law. They solicit no business there either through salespersons or through advertising reasonably calculated to reach the State. Nor does the record show that they regularly sell cars at wholesale or retail to Oklahoma customers or residents or that they indirectly, through others, serve or seek to serve the Oklahoma market. In short, respondents seek to base jurisdiction on one, isolated occurrence and whatever inferences can be drawn therefrom: the fortuitous circumstance that a single Audi automobile, sold in New York to New York residents, happened to suffer an accident while passing through Oklahoma.</p>
<p id="c079fa16-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is argued, however, that because an automobile is mobile by its very design and purpose it was “foreseeable” that the Robinsons’ Audi would cause injury in Oklahoma. Yet “foreseeability” alone has never been a sufficient benchmark for <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="103" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page103">p. 103</span>personal jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause. In <i>Hanson v. Denckla</i>, supra, it was no doubt foreseeable that the settlor of a Delaware trust would subsequently move to Florida and seek to exercise a power of appointment there; yet we held that Florida courts could not constitutionally exercise jurisdiction over a Delaware trustee that had no other contacts with the forum State. . . . </p>
<p id="c079fa17-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If foreseeability were the criterion, a local California tire retailer could be forced to defend in Pennsylvania when a blowout occurs there; a Wisconsin seller of a defective automobile jack could be haled before a distant court for damage caused in New Jersey; or a Florida soft drink concessionaire could be summoned to Alaska to account for injuries happening there. Every seller of chattels would in effect appoint the chattel his agent for service of process. His amenability to suit would travel with the chattel. We recently abandoned the outworn rule of <i>Harris v. Balk</i>, that the interest of a creditor in a debt could be extinguished or otherwise affected by any State having transitory jurisdiction over the debtor. <i>Shaffer v. Heitner</i>. Having interred the mechanical rule that a creditor’s amenability to a quasi in rem action travels with his debtor, we are unwilling to endorse an analogous principle in the present case.</p>
<p id="c079fa18-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is not to say, of course, that foreseeability is wholly irrelevant. But the foreseeability that is critical to due process analysis is not the mere likelihood that a product will find its way into the forum State. Rather, it is that the defendant’s conduct and connection with the forum State are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there. The Due Process Clause, by ensuring the “orderly administration of the laws,” gives a degree of predictability to the legal system that allows potential defendants to structure their primary conduct with some minimum assurance as to where that conduct will and will not render them liable to suit.</p>
<p id="c079fa19-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a corporation “purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State,” it has clear notice that it is subject to suit there, and can act to alleviate the risk of burdensome litigation by procuring insurance, passing the expected costs on to customers, or, if the risks are too great, severing its connection with the State. Hence if the sale of a product of a manufacturer or distributor such as Audi or Volkswagen is not simply an isolated occurrence, but arises from the efforts of the manufacturer or distributor to serve, directly or indirectly, the market for its product in other States, it is not unreasonable to subject it to suit in one of those States if its allegedly defective merchandise has there been the source of injury to its owner or to others. The forum State does not exceed its powers under the Due Process Clause if it asserts personal jurisdiction over a corporation that delivers its products into the stream of commerce with the expectation that they will be purchased by consumers in the forum State. Cf. <i>Gray v. American Radiator</i>.</p>
<p id="c079fa1a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But there is no such or similar basis for Oklahoma jurisdiction over World-Wide or Seaway in this case. Seaway’s sales are made in Massena, N.Y. World-Wide’s market, although substantially larger, is limited to dealers in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. There is no evidence of record that any automobiles distributed by World-Wide are sold to retail customers outside this tri-State area. It is foreseeable that the purchasers of automobiles sold by World-Wide and Seaway may take them to Oklahoma. But the mere “unilateral activity of those who claim some relationship with a <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="104" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page104">p. 104</span>nonresident defendant cannot satisfy the requirement of contact with the forum State.” <i>Hanson v. Denckla</i>.</p>
<p id="c079fa1b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a variant on the previous argument it is contended that jurisdiction can be supported by the fact that petitioners earn substantial revenue from goods used in Oklahoma. The Oklahoma Supreme Court so found, drawing the inference that because one automobile sold by petitioners had been used in Oklahoma, others might have been used there also. While this inference seems less than compelling on the facts of the instant case, we need not question the Court’s factual findings in order to reject its reasoning.</p>
<p id="c079fa1c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This argument seems to make the point that the purchase of automobiles in New York, from which the petitioners earn substantial revenue, would not occur but for the fact that the automobiles are capable of use in distant States like Oklahoma. Respondents observe that the very purpose of an automobile is to travel, and that travel of automobiles sold by petitioners is facilitated by an extensive chain of Volkswagen service centers throughout the Country, including some in Oklahoma.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN108CB_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N108CB_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">12</a></span> However, financial benefits accruing to the defendant from a collateral relation to the forum State will not support jurisdiction if they do not stem from a constitutionally cognizable contact with that State. In our view, whatever marginal revenues petitioners may receive by virtue of the fact that their products are capable of use in Oklahoma is far too attenuated a contact to justify that State’s exercise of in personam jurisdiction over them.</p>

An automobile is intended to be moved around. Someone in the business of selling large numbers of automobiles can hardly plead ignorance of their mobility or pretend that the automobiles stay put after they are sold. It is not merely that a dealer in automobiles foresees that they will move. The dealer actually intends that the purchasers will use the automobiles to travel to distant States where the dealer does not directly “do business.” The sale of an automobile does <i>purposefully</i> inject the vehicle into the stream of interstate commerce so that it can travel to distant States. . . . </p>

Seaway and World-Wide could “foresee” that their cars might end up in Oklahoma, or for that matter in any part of the world with paved roads connected to those in upstate New York, where Seaway was located; after all, cars are <i>supposed</i> to be mobile—that’s why advertisements show them zooming along open highways. Not enough, says the majority. Looking back to <i>Hanson v. Denkla</i>, the Court says the local dealer and the regional distributor did not purposefully avail themselves—did not seek out, by advertising or in other ways—the Oklahoma market, so jurisdiction does not lie. By contrast, the opinion suggests, though does not hold (because the issue was not presented), that the manufacturer and the national distributor did avail themselves—by buying advertising and establishing dealerships—of the Oklahoma market.</p></li>

That is where most personal jurisdiction cases end: with a state court applying existing doctrine. Out of the hundreds of such state court decisions—all interpreting and applying the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution, only a minute proportion will ever be reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court, although in theory all could be. Here the U.S. Supreme Court does grant review and decides that the Oklahoma court did not correctly apply the doctrine. Its analysis will now become part of the accumulating doctrine that both state and federal courts will apply when considering questions of personal jurisdiction.</p></li>

The system was manufactured in Japan and sold all over the United States. The national distributor was located in California.

Their failure to correct the defect would not be a defense in the Robinsons’ actions against Audi, but it might be the basis for requiring Seaway and World-Wide to indemnify Audi. Under these circumstances, Audi, after paying a judgment to the Robinsons, would have to sue Seaway and World-Wide separately, probably in New York. But because World-Wide and Seaway would not have been parties to the Oklahoma litigation, they would not be bound by the finding of a product defect. The result might be inconsistent judgments—Oklahoma holding Audi responsible for a design defect, but New York courts finding that there was no defect and that Audi was therefore not entitled to indemnity.</p></li>

<p id="c07a6f69-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Personal jurisdiction motions are strategic tools in a defendant’s arsenal, and therefore something plaintiffs must anticipate. In theory, a successful motion to dismiss for want of personal jurisdiction only delays the suit: At least as to a U.S. defendant, there will be some jurisdiction (permanent domicile, state of incorporation) where suit can be brought. So why do defendants bother?</p>
<p id="c07a6f6a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a marginal case, the suit might go away entirely. The statute of limitations in the new forum state may have run. Or, unlike the Robinsons’ case, which involved very serious permanent injuries, there could be a much lower damage bill. Plaintiff’s lawyer has to locate a competent practitioner in another state and arrange for her to take over the case, a process involving some expense. If witnesses have to travel, the added expense might make bringing the suit irrational.</p>
<p id="c07a6f6b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if the case persists, the defendant has done two things. He’s delayed the date at which he may have to pay damages (in many tort suits interest does not run until judgment is entered). And he’s moved the case to a different forum, which, for reasons having nothing to do with jurisdiction, may be friendlier.</p>
<p id="c07a6f6c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But plaintiffs too can behave strategically. Modern jurisdictional doctrine often permits plaintiff a choice of several fora in which to sue. In <i>World-Wide</i>, <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="108" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page108">p. 108</span>the plaintiffs could have sued Audi in New York, in Oklahoma, and perhaps in Arizona, where the Robinsons were moving on their ill-fated trip. The plaintiffs’ lawyer doubtless considered which of these fora would be most sympathetic to their case.</p>
<p id="c07a6f6d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In fact, <i>World-Wide Volkswagen</i> displays both sides maneuvering for strategic advantage by deploying jurisdictional doctrine. Reading the case, you may have wondered why the driver of the car that collided with the plaintiffs did not seem to be in the case, and why the plaintiffs bothered to name the local dealer and regional distributor as defendants in a product design defect case. Professor Charles Adams, who has looked into the story behind the case in World-Wide Volkswagen v. Woodson—<i>The Rest of the Story</i>, 72 Neb. L. Rev. 1122 (1993), provides an account that may answer the first of these questions:</p>

<p id="c07a6f6e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lloyd Hull knew he had a serious drinking problem. Ever since his retirement from the Navy two years before, it seemed as though he needed to get a little high, or better, every day. After getting off work on September 21, 1977, in Berryville, Arkansas, Lloyd was on his way to visit his older sister in Okarche, Oklahoma. Next to the bottle of Jim Beam on the front seat was a loaded .22 Magnum pistol for shooting jack rabbits on his sister’s farm. . . . </p>

<p id="c07a9682-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And why did the Robinsons name the New York dealer and regional distributor? The answer may lie in where the parties would want the case to be tried. Start with the plaintiff, who has the initial choice. Why did the Robinsons’ lawyer choose Oklahoma? According to Professor Adams, Creek County, Oklahoma, where the crash had occurred, was “a blue collar community that. . . . [had] become known to personal injury lawyers throughout the state as being particularly sympathetic to personal injury plaintiffs.” Id. at 1128.</p>
<p id="c07a9683-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But a successful strategy to try the case in Creek County would not only have to bring it there but keep it there. As you will see in the next chapter, noncitizen defendants may “remove” to federal court an action if the requisites of diversity have been met. Any good plaintiff’s lawyer would know that if he sued a German manufacturer and its national distributor (located in Michigan), the defendants could remove the case to a federal district court by invoking diversity jurisdiction. Since the federal district court nearest to Creek County is in Tulsa, and since that court would draw its jurors from a number of counties in the Eastern District of Oklahoma, the defendants could, by making such a move, dilute what plaintiff hoped would be a favorable jury pool.</p>
<p id="c07a9684-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Could the plaintiff prevent such removal? For diversity jurisdiction to exist, none of the defendants can be of the same state as the plaintiffs (a principle explored more fully in the next chapter). The Robinsons’ lawyer argued that the Robinsons, although they were on their way to Arizona, remained New York citizens until <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="109" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page109">p. 109</span>they had permanently settled in their new home. Hence the importance of naming World-Wide and Seaway, both New York corporations, as defendants: So long as they remained in the lawsuit, the case could not be removed to federal court and would therefore be tried before a Creek County jury.</p>
<p id="c07a9685-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendants’ counter was the motion to dismiss the two New York defendants for want of personal jurisdiction. Do you now understand why there was such a fierce battle about personal jurisdiction over two apparently irrelevant defendants?</p>
<p id="c07a9686-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given this background, what would you expect to be the remaining defendants’ next procedural move after the case has been sent back to Oklahoma courts with the holding that there is no jurisdiction over Seaway and World-Wide?</p>

<li class=""><p id="c07abd97-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Five years after <i>World-Wide</i>, the Court decided Burger King v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462 (1985). Burger King sells franchises for its fast food outlets to investors. To establish quality control and national brand uniformity Burger King requires its franchisees to adhere to a number of standards, including attendance at “Burger King University” in Miami, Florida, where franchise owners are trained in creating a uniform product. John Rudzewicz (a partner in a national accounting firm) and Brian MacShara, an acquaintance—both Michigan residents—applied to take over an existing Burger King franchise in a Detroit suburb. The Florida headquarters approved the application and MacShara, who was to supervise day-to-day operations, thereafter trained in Florida. When the franchise began to lose money and the partners fell behind in their payments, Burger King terminated the franchise and brought suit in Florida, invoking federal diversity jurisdiction. Rudzewicz and MacShara challenged the personal jurisdiction of the Florida district court, arguing that the franchise was in Michigan, and that their limited contact with Florida did not support jurisdiction over this claim. The Supreme Court disagreed, holding that by entering into a long-term agreement with a corporation known to be based in Florida, in a contract that called for the application of Florida law, and training in Florida, the partners had purposefully availed themselves of Florida law—enough to warrant the exercise of Florida jurisdiction over them in a suit seeking to enforce terms of the franchise agreement. In the process the majority opinion, written by Justice Brennan, enunciated principles that Brennan had espoused in other opinions (including his dissents in <i>Shaffer</i> and <i>World-Wide Volkswagen</i>) but had never previously won the day.</p>

Washington</i>. Thus courts in “appropriate [cases]” may evaluate “the burden on the defendant,” “the forum State’s interest in adjudicating the dispute,” “the plaintiff’s interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief,” “the interstate judicial system’s interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies,” and the “shared interest of the several States in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.” <i>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v.

This view of personal jurisdiction is a break from earlier cases: The Supreme Court’s majority opinions up until this point focused almost exclusively on whether there were sufficient “minimum contacts” between the defendant and the forum state without paying more than lip service to considerations of “fair play and substantial justice.” Justice Brennan’s analysis has neither found an echo in later cases nor been explicitly repudiated.</p>

In the next case, a tort plaintiff faced a national distributor who, after selling the allegedly defective product, went bankrupt.

<p id="c07b0bc8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether a person or entity is subject to the jurisdiction of a state court despite not having been present in the State either at the time of suit or at the time of the alleged injury, and despite not having consented to the exercise of jurisdiction, is a question that arises with great frequency in the routine course of litigation. The rules and standards for determining when a State does or does not have jurisdiction over an absent party have been unclear because of decades-old questions left open in Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty., 480 U.S. 102 (1987).</p>
<p id="c07b0bc9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, the Supreme Court of New Jersey, relying in part on <i>Asahi</i>, held that New Jersey’s courts can exercise jurisdiction over a foreign manufacturer of a product so long as the manufacturer “knows or reasonably should know that its products are distributed through a nationwide distribution system that might lead to those products being sold in any of the fifty states.” Applying that test, the court concluded that a British manufacturer of scrap metal machines was subject to jurisdiction in New Jersey, even though at no time had it advertised in, sent goods to, or in any relevant sense targeted the State.</p>
<p id="c07b0bca-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That decision cannot be sustained. . . . As a general rule, the exercise of judicial power is not lawful unless the defendant “purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.” Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 253 (1958). There may be exceptions, say, for instance, in cases involving an intentional tort. But the general rule is applicable in this products-liability case, and the so-called “stream-of-commerce” doctrine cannot displace it.</p>

Robert Nicastro seriously injured his hand while using a metal-shearing machine manufactured by J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. (J. McIntyre). The accident occurred in New Jersey, but the machine was manufactured in England, where J. McIntyre is incorporated and operates. The question here is whether the New Jersey courts have jurisdiction over J. McIntyre, notwithstanding the fact that the company at no time either marketed goods in the State or shipped them there.</p>
<p id="c07b0bcd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At oral argument in this Court, Nicastro’s counsel stressed three primary facts in defense of New Jersey’s assertion of jurisdiction over J. McIntyre.</p>
<p id="c07b0bce-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, an independent company agreed to sell J. McIntyre’s machines in the United States. J. McIntyre itself did not sell its machines to buyers in this country beyond the U.S. distributor, and there is no allegation that the distributor was under J. McIntyre’s control.</p>
<p id="c07b32df-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, J. McIntyre officials attended annual conventions for the scrap recycling industry to advertise J. McIntyre’s machines alongside the distributor. The conventions took place in various States, but never in New Jersey.</p>
<p id="c07b32e0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, no more than four machines, including the machine that caused the injuries that are the basis for this suit, ended up in New Jersey.</p>
<p id="c07b32e1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to these facts emphasized by respondent, the New Jersey Supreme Court noted that. . . . the U.S. distributor “structured [its] advertising and sales efforts in accordance with” J. McIntyre’s “direction and guidance whenever possible,” and that “at least some of the machines were sold on consignment to” the distributor. . . . </p>
<p id="c07b32e2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In light of these facts, the New Jersey Supreme Court concluded that New Jersey courts could exercise jurisdiction over petitioner. . . . </p>
<p id="c07b32e3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court’s <i>Asahi</i> decision [described below] may be responsible in part for [the New Jersey] court’s error regarding the stream of commerce, and this case presents an opportunity to provide greater clarity.</p>
</div>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c07b32e4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">II</p></div>
<p id="c07b32e5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A court may subject a defendant to judgment only when the defendant has sufficient contacts with the sovereign “such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend ’traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.’” International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945) (quoting Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U.S. 457, 463 (1940)). Freeform notions of fundamental fairness divorced from traditional practice cannot transform a judgment rendered in the absence of authority into law. As a general rule, the sovereign’s exercise of power requires some act by which the defendant “purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws,” <i>Hanson</i>, though in some cases, as with an intentional tort, the defendant might well fall within the State’s authority by reason of his attempt to obstruct its laws. In products-liability cases like this one, it is the defendant’s purposeful availment that makes jurisdiction consistent with “traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.”</p>
<p id="c07b32e6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A person may submit to a State’s authority in a number of ways. There is, of course, explicit consent. Presence within a State at the time suit commences <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="113" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page113">p. 113</span>through service of process is another example. See <i>Burnham</i> [casebook page 148]. Citizenship or domicile—or, by analogy, incorporation or principal place of business for corporations—also indicates general submission to a State’s powers. <i>Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown</i> [casebook page 129]. Each of these examples reveals circumstances, or a course of conduct, from which it is proper to infer an intention to benefit from and thus an intention to submit to the laws of the forum State. Cf. <i>Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz</i> [casebook page 109]. These examples support exercise of the general jurisdiction of the State’s courts and allow the State to resolve both matters that originate within the State and those based on activities and events elsewhere. By contrast, those who live or operate primarily outside a State have a due process right not to be subjected to judgment in its courts as a general matter.</p>
<p id="c07b32e7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is also a more limited form of submission to a State’s authority for disputes that “arise out of or are connected with the activities within the state.” <i>International Shoe Co</i>. Where a defendant “purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws,” <i>Hanson</i>, it submits to the judicial power of an otherwise foreign sovereign to the extent that power is exercised in connection with the defendant’s activities touching on the State. In other words, submission through contact with and activity directed at a sovereign may justify specific jurisdiction “in a suit arising out of or related to the defendant’s contacts with the forum.”</p>
<p id="c07b32e8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The imprecision arising from <i>Asahi</i>, for the most part, results from its statement of the relation between jurisdiction and the “stream of commerce.” The stream of commerce, like other metaphors, has its deficiencies as well as its utility. It refers to the movement of goods from manufacturers through distributors to consumers, yet beyond that descriptive purpose its meaning is far from exact. This Court has stated that a defendant’s placing goods into the stream of commerce “with the expectation that they will be purchased by consumers within the forum State” may indicate purposeful availment. <i>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson</i> (finding that expectation lacking). But that statement does not amend the general rule of personal jurisdiction. It merely observes that a defendant may in an appropriate case be subject to jurisdiction without entering the forum—itself an unexceptional proposition—as where manufacturers or distributors “seek to serve” a given State’s market. The principal inquiry in cases of this sort is whether the defendant’s activities manifest an intention to submit to the power of a sovereign. In other words, the defendant must “purposefully avai[l] itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.” <i>Hanson</i>; Insurance Corp. [of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. at 704-05 (1982)] (“[A]ctions of the defendant may amount to a legal submission to the jurisdiction of the court”). Sometimes a defendant does so by sending its goods rather than its agents. The defendant’s transmission of goods permits the exercise of jurisdiction only where the defendant can be said to have targeted the forum; as a general rule, it is not enough that the defendant might have predicted that its goods will reach the forum State.</p>
<p id="c07b32e9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Asahi</i>, an opinion by Justice Brennan for four Justices outlined a different approach. It discarded the central concept of sovereign authority in favor of considerations of fairness and foreseeability. As that concurrence contended, “jurisdiction <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="114" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page114">p. 114</span>premised on the placement of a product into the stream of commerce [without more] is consistent with the Due Process Clause,” for “[a]s long as a participant in this process is aware that the final product is being marketed in the forum State, the possibility of a lawsuit there cannot come as a surprise.” It was the premise of the concurring opinion that the defendant’s ability to anticipate suit renders the assertion of jurisdiction fair. In this way, the opinion made foreseeability the touchstone of jurisdiction.</p>
<p id="c07b59fa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The standard set forth in Justice Brennan’s concurrence was rejected in an opinion written by Justice O’Connor; but the relevant part of that opinion, too, commanded the assent of only four Justices, not a majority of the Court. That opinion stated: “The ’substantial connection’ between the defendant and the forum State necessary for a finding of minimum contacts must come about by an action of the defendant purposefully directed toward the forum State. The placement of a product into the stream of commerce, without more, is not an act of the defendant purposefully directed toward the forum State.” Id., at 112 (emphasis deleted; citations omitted).</p>
<p id="c07b59fb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since <i>Asahi</i> was decided, the courts have sought to reconcile the competing opinions. But Justice Brennan’s concurrence, advocating a rule based on general notions of fairness and foreseeability, is inconsistent with the premises of lawful judicial power. This Court’s precedents make clear that it is the defendant’s actions, not his expectations, that empower a State’s courts to subject him to judgment. . . . </p>
<p id="c07b59fc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two principles are implicit in the foregoing. First, personal jurisdiction requires a forum-by-forum, or sovereign-by-sovereign, analysis. The question is whether a defendant has followed a course of conduct directed at the society or economy existing within the jurisdiction of a given sovereign, so that the sovereign has the power to subject the defendant to judgment concerning that conduct. Personal jurisdiction, of course, restricts “judicial power not as a matter of sovereignty, but as a matter of individual liberty,” for due process protects the individual’s right to be subject only to lawful power. But whether a judicial judgment is lawful depends on whether the sovereign has authority to render it.</p>
<p id="c07b59fd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second principle is a corollary of the first. Because the United States is a distinct sovereign, a defendant may in principle be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States but not of any particular State. This is consistent with the premises and unique genius of our Constitution. Ours is “a legal system unprecedented in form and design, establishing two orders of government, each with its own direct relationship, its own privity, its own set of mutual rights and obligations to the people who sustain it and are governed by it.” For jurisdiction, a litigant may have the requisite relationship with the United States Government but not with the government of any individual State. That would be an exceptional case, however. If the defendant is a domestic domiciliary, the courts of its home State are available and can exercise general jurisdiction. And if another State were to assert jurisdiction in an inappropriate case, it would upset the federal balance, which posits that each State has a sovereignty that is not subject to unlawful intrusion by other States. Furthermore, foreign corporations will often target or concentrate on particular States, subjecting them to specific jurisdiction in those forums.</p>
<p id="c07b59fe-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It must be remembered, however, that although this case and <i>Asahi</i> both involve foreign manufacturers, the undesirable consequences of Justice Brennan’s approach <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="115" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page115">p. 115</span>are no less significant for domestic producers. The owner of a small Florida farm might sell crops to a large nearby distributor, for example, who might then distribute them to grocers across the country. If foreseeability were the controlling criterion, the farmer could be sued in Alaska or any number of other States’ courts without ever leaving town. And the issue of foreseeability may itself be contested so that significant expenses are incurred just on the preliminary issue of jurisdiction. Jurisdictional rules should avoid these costs whenever possible.</p>
<p id="c07b59ff-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The conclusion that the authority to subject a defendant to judgment depends on purposeful availment, consistent with Justice O’Connor’s opinion in <i>Asahi</i>, does not by itself resolve many difficult questions of jurisdiction that will arise in particular cases. The defendant’s conduct and the economic realities of the market the defendant seeks to serve will differ across cases, and judicial exposition will, in common-law fashion, clarify the contours of that principle.</p>

<p id="c07b5a01-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, petitioner directed marketing and sales efforts at the United States. It may be that, assuming it were otherwise empowered to legislate on the subject, the Congress could authorize the exercise of jurisdiction in appropriate courts. That circumstance is not presented in this case, however, and it is neither necessary nor appropriate to address here any constitutional concerns that might be attendant to that exercise of power. Nor is it necessary to determine what substantive law might apply were Congress to authorize jurisdiction in a federal court in New Jersey. A sovereign’s legislative authority to regulate conduct may present considerations different from those presented by its authority to subject a defendant to judgment in its courts. Here the question concerns the authority of a New Jersey state court to exercise jurisdiction, so it is petitioner’s purposeful contacts with New Jersey, not with the United States, that alone are relevant.</p>
<p id="c07b5a02-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent has not established that J. McIntyre engaged in conduct purposefully directed at New Jersey. . . . Indeed, after discovery the trial court found that the “defendant does not have a single contact with New Jersey short of the machine in question ending up in this state.” These facts may reveal an intent to serve the U.S. market, but they do not show that J.

At no time did petitioner engage in any activities in New Jersey that reveal an intent to invoke or benefit from the protection of its laws. New Jersey is without power to adjudge the rights and liabilities of J. McIntyre, and its exercise of jurisdiction would violate due process. The contrary judgment of the New Jersey Supreme Court is <i>Reversed</i>.</p>

<p id="c07b8116-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court of New Jersey adopted a broad understanding of the scope of personal jurisdiction based on its view that “[t]he increasingly fast-paced globalization of the world economy has removed national borders as barriers to trade.” I do not doubt that there have been many recent changes in commerce and communication, <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="116" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page116">p. 116</span>many of which are not anticipated by our precedents. But this case does not present any of those issues. So I think it unwise to announce a rule of broad applicability without full consideration of the modern-day consequences.</p>
<p id="c07b8117-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my view, the outcome of this case is determined by our precedents. Based on the facts found by the New Jersey courts, respondent Robert Nicastro failed to meet his burden to demonstrate that it was constitutionally proper to exercise jurisdiction over petitioner J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. (British Manufacturer), a British firm that manufactures scrap-metal machines in Great Britain and sells them through an independent distributor in the United States (American Distributor). On that basis, I agree with the plurality that the contrary judgment of the Supreme Court of New Jersey should be reversed. . . . </p>

<p id="c07b8125-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The machine that injured Nicastro, a “McIntyre Model 640 Shear,” sold in the United States for $24,900 in 1995, and features a “massive cutting capacity.” According to McIntyre UK’s product brochure, the machine is “use[d] throughout the [w]orld.” McIntyre UK represented in the brochure that, by “incorporat[ing] off-the-shelf hydraulic parts from suppliers with international sales outlets,” the 640 Shear’s design guarantees serviceability “wherever [its customers] may be based.” The instruction manual advises “owner[s] and operators of a 640 Shear [to] make themselves aware of [applicable health and safety regulations],” including “the American National Standards Institute Regulations (USA) for the use of Scrap Metal Processing Equipment.”</p>
<p id="c07b8126-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nicastro operated the 640 Shear in the course of his employment at Curcio Scrap Metal (CSM) in Saddle Brook, New Jersey. “New Jersey has long been a hotbed of scrap-metal businesses.  . . . ” In 2008, New Jersey recycling facilities processed 2,013,730 tons of scrap iron, steel, aluminum, and other metals—more than any other State—outpacing Kentucky, its nearest competitor, by nearly 30 percent.</p>
<p id="c07ba837-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">CSM’s owner, Frank Curcio, “first heard of [McIntyre UK’s] machine while attending an Institute of Scrap Metal Industries [(ISRI)] convention in Las Vegas in 1994 or 1995, where [McIntyre UK] was an exhibitor.” ISRI “presents the world’s largest scrap recycling industry trade show each year.” The event attracts “owners <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="118" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page118">p. 118</span>[and] managers of scrap processing companies” and others “interested in seeing—and purchasing—new equipment.” According to ISRI, more than 3,000 potential buyers of scrap processing and recycling equipment attend its annual conventions, “primarily because th[e] exposition provides them with the most comprehensive industry-related shopping experience concentrated in a single, convenient location.”</p>
<p id="c07ba838-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">McIntyre UK representatives attended every ISRI convention from 1990 through 2005. These annual expositions were held in diverse venues across the United States; in addition to Las Vegas, conventions were held 1990-2005 in New Orleans, Orlando, San Antonio, and San Francisco. McIntyre UK’s president, Michael Pownall, regularly attended ISRI conventions. He attended ISRI’s Las Vegas convention the year CSM’s owner first learned of, and saw, the 640 Shear. McIntyre UK exhibited its products at ISRI trade shows, the company acknowledged, hoping to reach “anyone interested in the machine from anywhere in the United States.”</p>
<p id="c07ba839-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although McIntyre UK’s U.S. sales figures are not in the record, it appears that for several years in the 1990’s, earnings from sales of McIntyre UK products in the United States “ha[d] been good” in comparison to “the rest of the world.” In response to interrogatories, McIntyre UK stated that its commissioning engineer had installed the company’s equipment in several States—Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Virginia, and Washington.</p>
<p id="c07ba83a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From at least 1995 until 2001, McIntyre UK retained an Ohio-based company, McIntyre Machinery America, Ltd. (McIntyre America), “as its exclusive distributor for the entire United States.” Though similarly named, the two companies were separate and independent entities with “no commonality of ownership or management.” In invoices and other written communications, McIntyre America described itself as McIntyre UK’s national distributor, “America’s Link” to “Quality Metal Processing Equipment” from England.</p>
<p id="c07ba83b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a November 23, 1999 letter to McIntyre America, McIntyre UK’s president spoke plainly about the manufacturer’s objective in authorizing the exclusive distributorship: “All we wish to do is sell our products in the [United] States—and get paid!” Notably, McIntyre America was concerned about U.S. litigation involving McIntyre UK products, in which the distributor had been named as a defendant. McIntyre UK counseled McIntyre America to respond personally to the litigation, but reassured its distributor that “the product was built and designed by McIntyre Machinery in the UK and the buck stops here—if there’s something wrong with the machine.”</p>
<p id="c07ba83c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Over the years, McIntyre America distributed several McIntyre UK products to U.S. customers, including, in addition to the 640 Shear, McIntyre UK’s “Niagara” and “Tardis” systems, wire strippers, and can machines. In promoting McIntyre UK’s products at conventions and demonstration sites and in trade journal advertisements, McIntyre America looked to McIntyre UK for direction and guidance. To achieve McIntyre UK’s objective, <i>i.e.,</i> “to sell [its] machines to customers throughout the United States,” “the two companies [were acting] closely in concert with each other.” McIntyre UK never instructed its distributor to avoid certain States or regions of the country; rather, as just noted, the manufacturer engaged McIntyre America to attract customers “from anywhere in the United States.”</p>
<p id="c07ba83d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, McIntyre UK’s regular attendance and exhibitions at ISRI conventions was surely a purposeful step to reach customers for its products “anywhere in the United States.” At least as purposeful was McIntyre UK’s engagement of McIntyre <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="119" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page119">p. 119</span>America as the conduit for sales of McIntyre UK’s machines to buyers “throughout the United States.” Given McIntyre UK’s endeavors to reach and profit from the United States market as a whole, Nicastro’s suit, I would hold, has been brought in a forum entirely appropriate for the adjudication of his claim. He alleges that McIntyre UK’s shear machine was defectively designed or manufactured and, as a result, caused injury to him at his workplace. The machine arrived in Nicastro’s New Jersey workplace not randomly or fortuitously, but as a result of the U.S. connections and distribution system that McIntyre UK deliberately arranged.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BC1_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10BC1_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">3</a></span> On what sensible view of the allocation of adjudicatory authority could the place of Nicastro’s injury within the United States be deemed off limits for his products liability claim against a foreign manufacturer who targeted the United States (including all the States that constitute the Nation) as the territory it sought to develop?</p>

Do not litigational convenience and choice-of-law considerations point in that direction? On what measure of reason and fairness can it be considered undue to require McIntyre UK to defend in New Jersey as an incident of its efforts to develop a market for its industrial machines anywhere and everywhere in the United States?

It might have done so had the plurality been a majority. But, as Justice Ginsburg’s dissent points out, Justice Kennedy’s opinion got only four votes—another plurality. So the case stands for the proposition that six Justices thought that jurisdiction did not lie under the circumstances described—and that four of those six would reject the “foreseeability” principle set forth by four Justices in <i>Asahi</i>.</p>

They write: “There may well have been other facts that Mr. Nicastro could have demonstrated in support of jurisdiction.

In 1960, Abdouch was the executive secretary of the Nebraska presidential campaign of John F. Kennedy. In 1963, <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="122" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page122">p. 122</span>Abdouch received a copy of the book, which was inscribed to her by the late author Richard Yates. The inscription stated: “For Helen Abdouch—with admiration and best wishes. Dick Yates. 8/19/63.” At some time not specified by the record, Abdouch’s inscribed copy of the book was stolen. Lopez and his company, KLB, bought the book in 2009 from a seller in Georgia and sold it that same year to a customer not in Nebraska. In 2011, Abdouch, who does not own a computer, learned from a friend that Lopez had used the inscription in the book for advertising purposes on his Web site, http://www.lopezbooks.com. The commercial advertisement had been used with the word “SOLD” on the Web site for more than 3 years after the book was sold. The advertisement associated with a picture of the inscription stated in relevant part:</p>

Dick Yates. 8/19/63.” Yates had worked as a speech writer for Robert Kennedy when Kennedy served as Attorney General; Abdouch was the executive secretary of the Nebraska (John F.) Kennedy organization when Robert Kennedy was campaign manager. The book is cocked; the boards are stained; the text is clean. A very good copy in a near fine, spine-tanned dust jacket. A scarce book, and it is extremely uncommon to find this advance issue of it signed. Given the date of the inscription—that is, during JFK’s Presidency—and the connection between writer and recipient, it’s reasonable to suppose this was an author’s copy, presented to Abdouch by Yates.

<p id="c07bf68a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Abdouch argues that the district court erred in finding that the State lacked personal jurisdiction over Lopez and KLB. Abdouch argues that Lopez and KLB’s active Web site deliberately targeted Abdouch with tortious conduct. She alleges these contacts are sufficient to create the necessary minimum contacts for specific jurisdiction. [The court concludes that Nebraska’s long-arm statute “extends Nebraska’s jurisdiction over nonresidents having any contact with or maintaining any relation to this state as far as the U.S. Constitution permits.” Note that state long-arm statutes are discussed infra page 177.]  . . . </p>

<p id="c07bf68c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Internet and its interaction with personal jurisdiction over a nonresident is an issue of first impression for this court. . . . [T]he Eighth Circuit, as well as the majority of circuits, has adopted the analytical framework set forth in <i>Zippo Mfg. Co. v. Zippo Dot Com., Inc</i>., for internet jurisdiction cases. In that case, Zippo Manufacturing Company [which made cigarette lighters] filed a complaint in Pennsylvania against nonresident Zippo Dot Com, Inc.[, a news service], alleging causes of action under the federal Trademark Act of 1946. Zippo Dot Com’s contact with Pennsylvania consisted of over 3,000 Pennsylvania residents subscribing to its Web site. The district court in <i>Zippo Mfg. Co.</i> famously created a “sliding scale” test that considers a Web site’s interactivity and the nature of the commercial activities conducted over the Internet to determine whether the courts have personal jurisdiction over nonresident defendants. The court in <i>Zippo Mfg. Co.</i> explained the “sliding scale” as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c07c1d9d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At one end of the spectrum are situations where a defendant clearly does business over the Internet. If the defendant enters into contracts with residents of a foreign jurisdiction that involve the knowing and repeated transmission of computer files over the Internet, personal jurisdiction is proper. . . . At the opposite end are situations where a defendant has simply posted information on an Internet Web site which is accessible to users in foreign jurisdictions. A passive Web site that does little more than make information available to those who are interested in it is not grounds for the exercise [of] personal jurisdiction. . . . The middle ground is occupied by interactive Web sites where a user can exchange information with the host computer. In these cases, the exercise of jurisdiction is determined by examining the level of interactivity and commercial nature of the exchange of information that occurs on the Web site.</p>
</div>
<p id="c07c1d9e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The district court held that Pennsylvania had personal jurisdiction over Zippo Dot Com and the causes of action. In doing so, the district court made two important findings. First, the district court found that the Zippo Dot Com Web site was a highly interactive commercial Web site. Second, and more important, the district court found that the trademark infringement causes of action were related to the business contacts with customers in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p id="c07c1d9f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the case at hand, it is evident that the Web site is interactive under the <i>Zippo Mfg. Co.</i> sliding scale test. In his affidavit, Lopez admits that customers can browse and purchase books from the online inventory. Lopez admits that he has two customers in Nebraska who are on the mailing list for KLB’s catalogs. He admits that from 2009 through 2011, a total of $614.87 in sales from the Web site was made to Nebraska residents out of an estimated $3.9 million in total sales.</p>
<p id="c07c1da0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But, beyond the minimal Web site sales to Nebraska residents and mailing catalogs to two Nebraska residents, Lopez’ and KLB’s contacts with Nebraska are nonexistent. Lopez and KLB do not own, lease, or rent land in Nebraska. They have never advertised directly in Nebraska, participated in bookfairs in Nebraska, or attended meetings in Nebraska, and neither has paid sales tax in Nebraska.</p>
<p id="c07c1da1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Furthermore, the Seventh Circuit has recently stated that when “the plaintiff’s claims are for intentional torts, the inquiry focuses on whether the conduct underlying <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="125" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page125">p. 125</span>the claims was purposely directed at the forum state.” The reason for requiring purposeful direction is to “’ensure that an out-of-state defendant is not bound to appear to account for merely “random, fortuitous, or attenuated contacts” with the forum state.’” Here, Abdouch’s cause of action is an intentional tort based on Nebraska’s privacy statute. There is no evidence, as discussed in greater detail later in the opinion, that Lopez and KLB purposefully directed the advertisement at Nebraska. Further, there is no evidence that Lopez and KLB intended to invade Abdouch’s privacy in the State of Nebraska. Rather, the limited Internet sales appear to be random, fortuitous, and attenuated contacts with Nebraska.</p>
<p id="c07c1da2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Therefore, although Lopez and KLB’s Web site is highly interactive, all of the contacts created by the Web site with the State of Nebraska are unrelated to Abdouch’s cause of action.</p>

<p id="c07c1da4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Abdouch argues that the effects test formulated by the U.S. Supreme Court in <i>Calder v. Jones</i> creates personal jurisdiction over Lopez and KLB, because Lopez and KLB aimed their tortious conduct at Abdouch and the State of Nebraska. In <i>Calder,</i> two Florida residents participated in the publication of an article about a California resident who brought a libel action in California against the Florida residents. Both defendants asserted that as Florida residents, they were not subject to the jurisdiction of the California court in which the libel action was filed. The Supreme Court rejected the defendants’ argument and noted that the defendants were not charged with mere untargeted negligence. Rather, their intentional, and allegedly tortious, actions were expressly aimed at California. Petitioner[s] wrote and. . . . edited an article that they knew would have a potentially devastating impact upon respondent. And they knew that the brunt of that injury would be felt by respondent in the State in which she lives and works and in which the National Enquirer [where the article was published] has its largest circulation. Under the circumstances, petitioners must “reasonably anticipate being haled into court there” to answer for the truth of the statements made in their article.</p>
<p id="c07c1da5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In coming to its holding, the U.S. Supreme Court created a test, now known as the <i>Calder</i> effects test, which has been explained by the Eighth Circuit [in <i>Johnson v. Arden</i>]:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c07c1da6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“[A] defendant’s tortious acts can serve as a source of personal jurisdiction only where the plaintiff makes a prima facie showing that the defendant’s acts (1) were intentional, (2) were uniquely or expressly aimed at the forum state, and (3) caused harm, the brunt of which was suffered—and which the defendant knew was likely to be suffered—[in the forum state].”</p>
</div>
<p id="c07c1da7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Third Circuit has noted that the effects test “can only be satisfied if the plaintiff can point to contacts which demonstrate that the defendant <i>expressly aimed</i> its tortious conduct at the forum, and thereby made the forum the focal point of the tortious activity.” Stated another way by the Third Circuit, “the effects test asks whether the plaintiff felt the brunt of the harm in the forum state, but it also asks <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="126" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page126">p. 126</span>whether defendants <i>knew</i> that the plaintiff would suffer the harm there and whether they <i>aimed</i> their tortious conduct at that state.” Similarly, the Eighth Circuit has stated that the <i>Calder</i> effects test “allows the assertion of personal jurisdiction over non-resident defendants whose acts ’are performed for the very purpose of having their consequences felt in the forum state.’”</p>
<p id="c07c44b8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . Lopez and KLB’s placement of the advertisement online was directed at the entire world, without expressly aiming the posting at the State of Nebraska. Abdouch pleaded in her complaint that the advertisement was “’broadcast’ or sent out over the world wide web,” but Abdouch failed to plead facts that demonstrate that Nebraska residents were targeted with the advertisement. Although the advertisement does mention that “Abdouch was the executive secretary of the Nebraska (John F.) Kennedy organization,” the advertisement does not expressly direct its offer of sale to Nebraska. As in <i>Johnson,</i> the mention of Nebraska here is incidental and was not included for the purposes of having the consequences felt in Nebraska. . . . Lopez did not know that Abdouch was a resident of Nebraska. He assumed that she had passed away and thus had no way of knowing that the brunt of harm would be suffered in Nebraska. Abdouch’s complaint fails to demonstrate that Lopez and KLB had an intent to target and focus on Nebraska residents . . . . </p>

<p id="c07c44ba-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that Abdouch’s complaint fails to plead facts to demonstrate that Lopez and KLB have sufficient minimum contacts with the State of Nebraska.

Furthermore, under the <i>Calder</i> effects test, the pleadings fail to establish that Lopez and KLB expressly aimed their tortious conduct at the State of Nebraska. For these reasons, Lopez and KLB could not have anticipated being haled into a Nebraska court for their online advertisement.</p>

<li><p id="c07c44bd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Doctrinally, <i>Abdouch</i> displays a court applying <i>International Shoe</i> to a new domain—the Internet. One of the virtues of <i>International Shoe</i>’s open-ended formulation is that it enables courts to apply it to new contexts.

<li><p id="c07c44be-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Abdouch</i> displays a state court, rather than the U.S. Supreme Court, working with familiar jurisdictional doctrine. Most civil litigation occurs in state courts. Because the Due Process Clause addresses itself to states, most challenges to personal jurisdiction will be decided in state courts, with the U.S. Supreme Court granting review only occasionally.

<li class=""><p id="c07c6bd3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second line draws on cases, including <i>Calder</i>, in which a defendant takes some action in State <i>A</i> that has effects in State <i>B</i>. (The classic example is standing by the state line and throwing a rock at someone in the adjacent state.)

So far as you can judge, what facts would have had to be different to support a finding of jurisdiction in Nebraska?</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c07c6bd4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Zippo</i> interactivity test has been criticized for asking not quite the right question.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c07c6bd5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One criticism of the <i>Zippo</i> test is that the Internet operates differently now than it did in 1997, when <i>Zippo</i> was decided. “Virtually all websites. . . . are now interactive in nature” and most “also interact with the user ’behind the scenes’ through the use of ’cookies.’ Thus, even a website that appears ’passive in nature may actually be interacting with the user’s data and custom-tailoring the content based on the user’s identity, demographics, browsing history, and personal preferences.” Kindig It Design, Inc. v.

<li class=""><p id="c07c6bd6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some have argued that the focus should not be on the extent of interactivity, but rather the features of the site that demonstrate purposeful availment of the benefits and protections of the state. According to this criticism, a site that was intensely interactive—allowing visitors to post comments and pictures, and play games, for example—might nevertheless fail to support jurisdiction if the creator of the site did not target users in the state. Conversely, a very modestly interactive site on which shoppers could order and pay for products—that in the process ascertained the address and contact information for users—would support jurisdiction for claims arising out of those orders. Persuasive?</p></li>

Fiore, 134 S. Ct. 1115 (2014). Gina Fiore and her companion were professional gamblers. Returning from a gambling trip to Puerto Rico, they were carrying hand luggage containing $97,000 in cash, their gambling “bank” and winnings. While in the process of changing planes in Atlanta to board a flight to Nevada, they were questioned by federal Drug Enforcement Agents who seized the funds as suspected proceeds of drug trafficking. Fiore’s Nevada attorney contacted the DEA and submitted various forms of evidence supporting the claim that the funds were derived from gambling, not narcotics. While these conversations were going on, Walden, the agent who had first seized the cash, drafted an allegedly false affidavit supporting an effort to have the money forfeited as the proceeds of drug sales. Fiore filed suit in federal court for the District of Nevada, alleging violations of constitutionally protected rights and seeking damages. Defendant challenged the assertion of personal jurisdiction over him, pointing out that the seizure had occurred in Georgia and defendant had no contacts with Nevada. Plaintiff countered that at the time the false affidavit was drafted, defendant knew that his action would affect her in Nevada (because he knew that was one of her residences) and that such knowledge sufficed. No, held a unanimous Court: “A forum State’s exercise of jurisdiction over an out-of-state intentional tortfeasor must be based on intentional contact by the defendant that creates the necessary contacts with the forum.” The opinion sought to distinguish <i>Calder v. Jones</i>, described above in <i>Abdouch</i>. In <i>Calder</i>, the <i>Fiore</i> Court pointed out, it wasn’t just the plaintiff’s California residence that mattered, but the phone calls to California sources for the story and the substantial sales of the tabloid in California. In <i>Fiore</i>, by contrast, the only link to Nevada was the defendant’s knowledge that Nevada was one of the states in which plaintiff resided—not enough.</p></li>

<p id="c07c92ea-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The cases in the previous section all concern the relationship to the forum state necessary to support specific jurisdiction. For example, <i>Burger King</i> holds that Florida had jurisdiction to hear a lawsuit against Mr. Rudzewicz arising out of his dealings with Burger King. The case does not stand for the proposition that Florida could hear a lawsuit brought by Mr. Rudzewicz’s Michigan neighbor claiming that his tree roots had clogged the neighbor’s drains, or a suit by an Iowa motorist claiming that Rudzewicz had collided with her on a Colorado road.</p>
<p id="c07c92eb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under what circumstances will defendant be subject to jurisdiction for all claims—even those without any connection to the forum state? In passing, <i>International Shoe</i> suggests that, at least for U.S. defendants, there will always be a state in which suit may be brought on all claims. For corporations, the state of incorporation will be such a forum; so will the state that is the principal place of business (if different from the state of incorporation). General Motors (GM), incorporated in Delaware and with its principal place of business in Michigan, may be sued in either of those states even for claims unrelated to its activities there. Thus an Oregon automobile owner claiming injuries due to a defectively designed GM vehicle could sue <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="129" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page129">p. 129</span>in either Michigan or Delaware. That would be true even if the vehicle had been manufactured at a GM plant in Texas, Mexico, or Germany.</p>
<p id="c07c92ec-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A similar situation holds true for individuals. As already noted, <i>Milliken v. Meyer</i> (supra page 78) stands for the proposition that individuals can be sued in the state of their domicile for all claims. Thus a resident of Michigan could be sued there for claims arising out of an auto accident that occurred while he was vacationing in Colorado.</p>
<p id="c07c92ed-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The states of domicile (for individuals) and incorporation and principal place of business (for corporations) comprise the easy instances of general jurisdiction, instances where defendants are being sued in what is self-evidently their “base of operations.” In the next two cases, the Supreme Court considers whether and under what circumstances the principle of general jurisdiction extends beyond these limited bounds: not very far, it appears.</p>

Attributing the accident to a defective tire manufactured in Turkey at the plant of a foreign subsidiary of The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company (Goodyear USA), the boys’ parents commenced an action for damages in a North Carolina state court; they named as defendants Goodyear USA, an Ohio corporation, and three of its subsidiaries, organized and operating, respectively, in Turkey, France, and Luxembourg. Goodyear USA, which had plants in North Carolina and regularly engaged in commercial activity there, did not contest the North Carolina court’s jurisdiction over it; Goodyear USA’s foreign subsidiaries, however, maintained that North Carolina lacked adjudicatory authority over them.</p>
<p id="c07cba05-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A state court’s assertion of jurisdiction exposes defendants to the State’s coercive power, and is therefore subject to review for compatibility with the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. <i>International Shoe Co. v.

<p id="c07cba07-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the episode-in-suit, the bus accident, occurred in France, and the tire alleged to have caused the accident was manufactured and sold abroad, North Carolina courts lacked specific jurisdiction to adjudicate the controversy. The North Carolina Court of Appeals so acknowledged. Were the foreign subsidiaries nonetheless amenable to general jurisdiction in North Carolina courts? Confusing or blending general and specific jurisdictional inquiries, the North Carolina courts answered yes. Some of the tires made abroad by Goodyear’s foreign subsidiaries, the North Carolina Court of Appeals stressed, had reached North Carolina through “the stream of commerce”; that connection, the Court of Appeals believed, gave North Carolina courts the handle needed for the exercise of general jurisdiction over the foreign corporations.</p>

<p id="c07cba09-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Endeavoring to give specific content to the “fair play and substantial justice” concept, the Court in <i>International Shoe</i> classified cases involving out-of-state corporate defendants. First, as in <i>International Shoe</i> itself, jurisdiction unquestionably could be asserted where the corporation’s in-state activity is “continuous and systematic” and <i>that activity gave rise to the episode-in-suit</i>. Further, the Court observed, the commission of certain “single or occasional acts” in a State may be sufficient to render a corporation answerable in that State with respect to those acts, though not with respect to matters unrelated to the forum connections. The heading courts today use to encompass these two <i>International Shoe</i> categories is “specific jurisdiction.” See von Mehren &amp; Trautman 1144-1163. Adjudicatory authority is “specific” when the suit “aris[es] out of or relate[s] to the defendant’s contacts with the forum.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c07cba0a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In only two decisions postdating <i>International Shoe</i> has this Court considered whether an out-of-state corporate defendant’s in-state contacts were sufficiently “continuous and systematic” to justify the exercise of general jurisdiction over claims unrelated to those contacts: Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., 342 U.S. 437 (1952) (general jurisdiction appropriately exercised over Philippine corporation sued in Ohio, where the company’s affairs were overseen during World War II); and <i>Helicopteros</i> (helicopter owned by Colombian corporation crashed in Peru; survivors of U.S. citizens who died in the crash, the Court held, could not maintain wrongful-death actions against the Colombian corporation in Texas, for the corporation’s helicopter purchases and purchase-linked activity in Texas were insufficient to subject it to Texas court’s general jurisdiction).</p>

<p id="c07cba0c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To justify the exercise of general jurisdiction over petitioners, the North Carolina courts relied on the petitioners’ placement of their tires in the “stream of commerce.” The stream-of-commerce metaphor has been invoked frequently in lower court decisions <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="131" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page131">p. 131</span>permitting “jurisdiction in products liability cases in which the product has traveled through an extensive chain of distribution before reaching the ultimate consumer.” 18 W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Corporations §8640.40, p. 133 (rev. ed. 2007). Typically, in such cases, a nonresident defendant, acting <i>outside</i> the forum, places in the stream of commerce a product that ultimately causes harm <i>inside</i> the forum. . . . </p>
<p id="c07cba0d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The North Carolina court’s stream-of-commerce analysis elided the essential difference between case-specific and all-purpose (general) jurisdiction. Flow of a manufacturer’s products into the forum, we have explained, may bolster an affiliation germane to <i>specific</i> jurisdiction. See, e.g., <i>World-Wide Volkswagen</i> (where “the sale of a product. . . . is not simply an isolated occurrence, but arises from the efforts of the manufacturer or distributor to serve. . . . the market for its product in [several] States, it is not unreasonable to subject it to suit in one of those States if its allegedly defective merchandise <i>has there been the source of injury to its owner or to others</i>” (emphasis added)). But ties serving to bolster the exercise of specific jurisdiction do not warrant a determination that, based on those ties, the forum has <i>general</i> jurisdiction over a defendant. . . . </p>
<p id="c07ce11e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A corporation’s “continuous activity of some sorts within a state,” <i>International Shoe</i> instructed, “is not enough to support the demand that the corporation be amenable to suits unrelated to that activity.” Our 1952 decision in <i>Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co</i>. remains “[t]he textbook case of general jurisdiction appropriately exercised over a foreign corporation that has not consented to suit in the forum.”</p>
<p id="c07ce11f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sued in Ohio, the defendant in <i>Perkins</i> was a Philippine mining corporation that had ceased activities in the Philippines during World War II. To the extent that the company was conducting any business during and immediately after the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, it was doing so in Ohio: the corporation’s president maintained his office there, kept the company files in that office, and supervised from the Ohio office “the necessarily limited wartime activities of the company.” Although the claim-in-suit did not arise in Ohio, this Court ruled that it would not violate due process for Ohio to adjudicate the controversy. . . . </p>
<p id="c07ce120-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Measured against <i>Helicopteros</i> and <i>Perkins</i>, North Carolina is not a forum in which it would be permissible to subject petitioners to general jurisdiction. Unlike the defendant in <i>Perkins</i>, whose sole wartime business activity was conducted in Ohio, petitioners are in no sense at home in North Carolina. Their attenuated connections to the State, fall far short of the “the continuous and systematic general business contacts” necessary to empower North Carolina to entertain suit against them on claims unrelated to anything that connects them to the State. <i>Helicopteros</i>, 466 U.S., at 416, 104 S.

The parent company, Goodyear USA, did not challenge personal jurisdiction so they are before the court.

<li class=""><p id="c07d083b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So unless the plaintiffs could obtain jurisdiction over the foreign subsidiary in the United States they could not pursue their claim in the United States.

<li class=""><p id="c07d083c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suing outside the United States also has many collateral difficulties. A few examples: Most other countries bar the contingent fee, so hiring a lawyer could be difficult; many countries limit wrongful death damages to a much greater extent than in the United States; collecting a judgment can be more difficult than it is in the United States; and in many nations the loser pays the winner’s attorneys’ fees—making the bringing of a less-than-certain claim a risky proposition.</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c07d083d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You will regularly see case-law references to general jurisdiction. But, as Prof. Mary Twitchell argues in the article cited in the opinion, most of those references come in cases in which a court says something resembling that said in <i>Goodyear</i>: There’s no specific jurisdiction in this case and, though plaintiff argues valiantly, there’s no general jurisdiction either. One can see this pattern at work in the next case, in which the plaintiffs ignored the subsidiaries and took direct aim at the parent. A word of introduction about the federal statute that formed the basis for the substantive claim may help. The Alien <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="133" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page133">p. 133</span>Tort Statute, 28 U.S.C. §1350, grants jurisdiction to the federal courts for “civil action[s] by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States.” Enacted in 1789, apparently out of the embarrassed discovery that the young federal courts lacked jurisdiction to hear a civil claim arising out of an assault on a diplomat by a foreign national, the statute lacks both a clarifying legislative history or much case law. In recent decades, it served as a vehicle for those seeking to redress abuses of human rights occurring outside the United States. The Supreme Court limited the reach of the Alien Tort Statute in Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 133 S. Ct. 1659 (2013) (invoking presumption that U.S. statutes were not intended to have extra-territorial reach). The next case creates an additional barrier to liability under the Alien Tort Statute based in its analysis of the scope of general jurisdiction.</p></li>

As to the former, we held that a court may assert jurisdiction over a foreign corporation “to hear any and all claims against [it]” only when the corporation’s affiliations with the State in which suit is brought are so constant and pervasive “as to render [it] essentially at home in the forum State.” Instructed by <i>Goodyear</i>, we conclude Daimler is not “at home” in California, and cannot be sued there for injuries plaintiffs attribute to MB Argentina’s conduct in Argentina.</p>

Plaintiffs would have us look beyond the exemplar bases <i>Goodyear</i> identified, and approve the exercise of general jurisdiction in every State in which a corporation “engages in a substantial, continuous, and systematic course of business.” That formulation, we hold, is unacceptably grasping. . . . </p>
<p id="c07d7c8e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, the inquiry under <i>Goodyear</i> is not whether a foreign corporation’s in-forum contacts can be said to be in some sense “continuous and systematic,” it is whether that corporation’s “affiliations with the State are so ’continuous and systematic’ as to render [it] essentially at home in the forum State.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1104A_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N1104A_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">19</a></span>  . . . </p>

If Daimler’s California activities sufficed to allow adjudication of this Argentina-rooted case in California, the same global reach would presumably be available in every other State in which MBUSA’s sales are sizable. Such exorbitant exercises of all-purpose jurisdiction would scarcely permit out-of-state defendants “to structure their primary conduct with some minimum assurance as to where that conduct will and will not render them liable to suit.”  . . . </p>

<p id="c07d7c93-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the transnational context of this dispute bears attention. . . . </p>
<p id="c07da3a4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Ninth Circuit. . . . paid little heed to the risks to international comity its expansive view of general jurisdiction posed. Other nations do not share the uninhibited approach to personal jurisdiction advanced by the Court of Appeals in this case. In the European Union, for example, a corporation may generally be sued in the nation in which it is “domiciled,” a term defined to refer only to the location of the corporation’s “statutory seat,” “central administration,” or “principal place of business.” European Parliament and Council Reg. 1215/2012, Arts. 4(1), and 63(1), 2012 O. J. (L. 351) 7, 18. . . . The Solicitor General informs us, in this regard, that “foreign governments’ objections to some domestic courts’ expansive views of general jurisdiction have in the past impeded negotiations of international agreements on the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments.”. . . . Considerations of international rapport thus reinforce our determination that subjecting Daimler to the general jurisdiction of courts in California would not accord with the “fair play and substantial justice” due process demands. . . . </p>
<p id="c07da3a5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is</p>
<p id="c07da3a6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reversed.</p>

<p id="c07da3a8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I agree with the Court’s conclusion that the Due Process Clause prohibits the exercise of personal jurisdiction over Daimler in light of the unique circumstances of this case. I concur only in the judgment, however, because I cannot agree with the path the Court takes to arrive at that result.</p>
<p id="c07da3a9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court acknowledges that Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA), Daimler’s wholly owned subsidiary, has considerable contacts with California. It has multiple facilities in the State, including a regional headquarters. Each year, it distributes in California tens of thousands of cars, the sale of which generated billions of dollars in the year this suit was brought. And it provides service and sales support to customers throughout the State. Daimler has conceded that California courts may exercise general jurisdiction over MBUSA on the basis of these contacts, and the Court assumes that MBUSA’s contacts may be attributed to Daimler for the purpose of deciding whether Daimler is also subject to general jurisdiction.</p>
<p id="c07da3aa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="138" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page138">p. 138</span>Are these contacts sufficient to permit the exercise of general jurisdiction over Daimler? The Court holds that they are not, for a reason wholly foreign to our due process jurisprudence. The problem, the Court says, is not that Daimler’s contacts with California are too few, but that its contacts with other forums are too many. In other words, the Court does not dispute that the presence of multiple offices, the direct distribution of thousands of products accounting for billions of dollars in sales, and continuous interaction with customers throughout a State would be enough to support the exercise of general jurisdiction over some businesses. Daimler is just not one of those businesses, the Court concludes, because its California contacts must be viewed in the context of its extensive “nationwide and worldwide” operations. In recent years, Americans have grown accustomed to the concept of multinational corporations that are supposedly “too big to fail”; today the Court deems Daimler “too big for general jurisdiction.”</p>
<p id="c07da3ab-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s conclusion is wrong as a matter of both process and substance. As to process, the Court decides this case on a ground that was neither argued nor passed on below, and that Daimler raised for the first time in a footnote to its brief. As to substance, the Court’s focus on Daimler’s operations outside of California ignores the lodestar of our personal jurisdiction jurisprudence: A State may subject a defendant to the burden of suit if the defendant has sufficiently taken advantage of the State’s laws and protections through its contacts in the State; whether the defendant has contacts elsewhere is immaterial.</p>
<p id="c07da3ac-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Regrettably, these errors are unforced. The Court can and should decide this case on the far simpler ground that, no matter how extensive Daimler’s contacts with California, that State’s exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable given that the case involves foreign plaintiffs suing a foreign defendant based on foreign conduct, and given that a more appropriate forum is available. Because I would reverse the judgment below on this ground, I concur in the judgment only. . . . </p>

Assuming that MBUSA’s actions are attributable to Daimler AG (the German parent company), as it was assumed in <i>Daimler</i>, the plaintiff would be able to establish personal jurisdiction over both MBUSA and Daimler AG in California. Why? Why is this factual scenario distinguishable from <i>Daimler AG v. Bauman</i>?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c07dcac4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After <i>Goodyear</i> and <i>Daimler</i> when, if ever, will a corporate defendant be “at home” in a state other than that of its principal place of business or state of incorporation? Consider a hypothetical suit against Boeing Aircraft, incorporated in Delaware. For many decades, Boeing’s headquarters was in the State of Washington, and almost all of its manufacturing operations occurred in Washington, where it was considered to be a core employer. It has now relocated its headquarters to Chicago, Illinois, but the bulk of its manufacturing operations continue to occur in Washington. Suppose there was an air crash involving a Boeing plane not manufactured in Washington, with suit brought in that state. Might Boeing be sufficiently “at home” there to satisfy the court’s general jurisdiction test?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c07dcac5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Daimler</i> restates the proposition that a corporation will be subject to general jurisdiction in the state where it “has its principal place of business.” As you will see, that concept recurs in several contexts—(1) in personal jurisdiction; (2) in venue (treated later in this chapter); and (3) in the context of federal diversity jurisdiction (discussed in Chapter 3). As you will see, in the latter context the U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the relevant diversity statute to define a corporation’s principal place of business as being the state where its “officers direct, control, and coordinate the corporation’s activities.” Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 599 U.S. 77 (2010) (infra page 225). It would be lovely, would it not, for us to be able to report that the same test also controls in the case of personal jurisdiction and venue? But we cannot: There is no definitive ruling that the same phrase means the same thing in all three settings. Just as “citizen” may mean one thing for naturalization purposes, another for getting a driver’s license, and a third for in-state university tuition, it is possible that courts will give the same phrase somewhat different meanings in these contexts as well.</p></li>

Over 50 percent of BMs’s work force in the United States is employed in those two States.</p>
<p id="c07df1e0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">BMS also engages in business activities in other jurisdictions, including California.

<p id="c07df1e1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of the pharmaceuticals that BMS manufactures and sells is Plavix, a prescription drug that thins the blood and inhibits blood clotting. BMS did not develop Plavix in California, did not create a marketing strategy for Plavix in California, and did not manufacture, label, package, or work on the regulatory approval of the product in California. BMS instead engaged in all of these activities in either New York or New Jersey. But BMS does sell Plavix in California. Between 2006 and 2012, it sold almost 187 million Plavix pills in the State and took in more than $900 million from those sales. This amounts to a little over one percent of the company’s nationwide sales revenue.</p>

<p id="c07e18f3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A group of plaintiffs—consisting of 86 California residents and 592 residents from 33 other States—filed eight separate complaints in California Superior Court, alleging that Plavix had damaged their health. All the complaints asserted 13 claims under California law, including products liability, negligent misrepresentation, and misleading advertising claims. The nonresident plaintiffs did not allege that they obtained Plavix through California physicians or from any other California source; nor did they claim that they were injured by Plavix or were treated for their injuries in California.</p>
<p id="c07e18f4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Asserting lack of personal jurisdiction, BMS moved to quash service of summons on the nonresidents’ claims, but the California Superior Court denied this motion, finding that the California courts had general jurisdiction over BMS “[b]ecause [it] <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="141" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page141">p. 141</span>engages in extensive activities in California.” BMS unsuccessfully petitioned the State Court of Appeal for a writ of mandate, but after our decision on general jurisdiction in <i>Daimler AG v. Bauman</i> [casebook page 133], the California Supreme Court instructed the Court of Appeal “to vacate its order denying mandate and to issue an order to show cause why relief sought in the petition should not be granted.”</p>
<p id="c07e18f5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeal then changed its decision on the question of general jurisdiction. Under <i>Daimler</i>, it held, general jurisdiction was clearly lacking, but it went on to find that the California courts had specific jurisdiction over the nonresidents’ claims against BMS.</p>
<p id="c07e18f6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The California Supreme Court affirmed. The court unanimously agreed with the Court of Appeal on the issue of general jurisdiction, but the court was divided on the question of specific jurisdiction. The majority applied a “sliding scale approach to specific jurisdiction.” Under this approach, “the more wide ranging the defendant’s forum contacts, the more readily is shown a connection between the forum contacts and the claim.” Applying this test, the majority concluded that “BMs’s extensive contacts with California” permitted the exercise of specific jurisdiction “based on a less direct connection between BMs’s forum activities and plaintiffs’ claims than might otherwise be required.” This attenuated requirement was met, the majority found, because the claims of the nonresidents were similar in several ways to the claims of the California residents (as to which specific jurisdiction was uncontested). The court noted that “[b]oth the resident and nonresident plaintiffs’ claims are based on the same allegedly defective product and the assertedly misleading marketing and promotion of that product.” And while acknowledging that “there is no claim that Plavix itself was designed and developed in [BMs’s California research facilities],” the court thought it significant that other research was done in the State.</p>

<p id="c07e18f9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It has long been established that the Fourteenth Amendment limits the personal jurisdiction of state courts. . . . The primary focus of our personal jurisdiction inquiry is the defendant’s relationship to the forum State.</p>
<p id="c07e18fa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since our seminal decision in <i>International Shoe,</i> our decisions have recognized two types of personal jurisdiction: “general” (sometimes called “all-purpose”) jurisdiction and “specific” (sometimes called “case-linked”) jurisdiction. <i>Goodyear</i> [casebook page 129]. “For an individual, the paradigm forum for the exercise of general jurisdiction is the individual’s domicile; for a corporation, it is an equivalent place, one in which the corporation is fairly regarded as at home.” <i>Id.</i> A court with general jurisdiction may hear <i>any</i> claim against that defendant, even if all the incidents underlying the claim occurred in a different State. But “only a limited set of affiliations with a forum will render a defendant amenable to” general jurisdiction in that State. <i>Daimler</i>.</p>
<p id="c07e18fb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Specific jurisdiction is very different. In order for a state court to exercise specific jurisdiction, “the <i>suit</i>” must “aris[e] out of or relat[e] to the defendant’s contacts with the <i>forum</i>.” <i>Id.</i> In other words, there must be “an affiliation between the forum and the underlying controversy, principally, [an] activity or an occurrence that takes <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="142" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page142">p. 142</span>place in the forum State and is therefore subject to the State’s regulation.” <i>Goodyear.</i> For this reason, “specific jurisdiction is confined to adjudication of issues deriving from, or connected with, the very controversy that establishes jurisdiction.” <i>Ibid. . . . </i></p>
<p id="c07e400c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In determining whether personal jurisdiction is present, a court must consider a variety of interests. These include “the interests of the forum State and of the plaintiff in proceeding with the cause in the plaintiff’s forum of choice.” But the “primary concern” is “the burden on the defendant.” Assessing this burden obviously requires a court to consider the practical problems resulting from litigating in the forum, but it also encompasses the more abstract matter of submitting to the coercive power of a State that may have little legitimate interest in the claims in question. As we have put it, restrictions on personal jurisdiction “are more than a guarantee of immunity from inconvenient or distant litigation. They are a consequence of territorial limitations on the power of the respective States.” <i>Hanson,</i> [casebook page 87]. “[T]he States retain many essential attributes of sovereignty, including, in particular, the sovereign power to try causes in their courts. The sovereignty of each State. . . . implie[s] a limitation on the sovereignty of all its sister States.” <i>World-Wide Volkswagen</i>, [casebook page 100]. And at times, this federalism interest may be decisive. As we explained in <i>World-Wide Volkswagen</i>, “[e]ven if the defendant would suffer minimal or no inconvenience from being forced to litigate before the tribunals of another State; even if the forum State has a strong interest in applying its law to the controversy; even if the forum State is the most convenient location for litigation, the Due Process Clause, acting as an instrument of interstate federalism, may sometimes act to divest the State of its power to render a valid judgment.”</p>

<p id="c07e400e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our settled principles regarding specific jurisdiction control this case. In order for a court to exercise specific jurisdiction over a claim, there must be an “affiliation between the forum and the underlying controversy, principally, [an] activity or an occurrence that takes place in the forum State.” <i>Goodyear.</i> When there is no such connection, specific jurisdiction is lacking regardless of the extent of a defendant’s unconnected activities in the State.</p>
<p id="c07e400f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For this reason, the California Supreme Court’s “sliding scale approach” is difficult to square with our precedents. Under the California approach, the strength of the requisite connection between the forum and the specific claims at issue is relaxed if the defendant has extensive forum contacts that are unrelated to those claims. Our cases provide no support for this approach, which resembles a loose and spurious form of general jurisdiction. For specific jurisdiction, a defendant’s general connections with the forum are not enough. As we have said, “[a] corporation’s ’continuous activity of some sorts within a state. . . . is not enough to support the demand that the corporation be amenable to suits unrelated to that activity.’”</p>
<p id="c07e4010-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The present case illustrates the danger of the California approach. The State Supreme Court found that specific jurisdiction was present without identifying any adequate link between the State and the nonresidents’ claims. As noted, the nonresidents were not prescribed Plavix in California, did not ingest Plavix in California, and were not injured by Plavix in California. The mere fact that <i>other</i> plaintiffs were prescribed, obtained, and ingested Plavix in California—and allegedly sustained the <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="143" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page143">p. 143</span>same injuries as did the non-residents—does not allow the State to assert specific jurisdiction over the nonresidents’ claims . . . . Nor is it sufficient—or even relevant—that BMS conducted research in California on matters unrelated to Plavix. What is needed—and what is missing here—is a connection between the forum and the specific claims at issue . . . . </p>
<p id="c07e4011-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a last ditch contention, respondents contend that BMs’s “decision to contract with a California company [McKesson] to distribute [Plavix] nationally” provides a sufficient basis for personal jurisdiction. But as we have explained, “[t]he requirements of <i>International Shoe</i>. . . . must be met as to each defendant over whom a state court exercises jurisdiction.” In this case, it is not alleged that BMS engaged in relevant acts together with McKesson in California. Nor is it alleged that BMS is derivatively liable for McKesson’s conduct in California. And the nonresidents have adduced no evidence to show how or by whom the Plavix they took was distributed to the pharmacies that dispensed it to them. The bare fact that BMS contracted with a California distributor is not enough to establish personal jurisdiction in the State.</p>

Our decision does not prevent the California and out-of-state plaintiffs from joining together in a consolidated action in the States that have general jurisdiction over BMS. BMS concedes that such suits could be brought in either New York or Delaware. Alternatively, the plaintiffs who are residents of a particular State—for example, the 92 plaintiffs from Texas and the 71 from Ohio—could probably sue together in their home States. In addition, since our decision concerns the due process limits on the exercise of specific jurisdiction by a State, we leave open the question whether the Fifth Amendment imposes the same restrictions on the exercise of personal jurisdiction by a federal court. . . . </p>

<p id="c07e6728-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Three years ago, the Court imposed substantial curbs on the exercise of general jurisdiction in its decision in <i>Daimler AG v. Bauman</i>. Today, the Court takes its first step toward a similar contraction of specific jurisdiction by holding that a corporation that engages in a nationwide course of conduct cannot be held accountable in a state court by a group of injured people unless all of those people were injured in the forum State.</p>
<p id="c07e6729-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I fear the consequences of the Court’s decision today will be substantial. The majority’s rule will make it difficult to aggregate the claims of plaintiffs across the country whose claims may be worth little alone. It will make it impossible to bring a nationwide mass action in state court against defendants who are “at home” in different States. And it will result in piecemeal litigation and the bifurcation of claims. None of this is necessary. A core concern in this Court’s personal jurisdiction cases is <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="144" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page144">p. 144</span>fairness.

<p id="c07e672b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he California courts appropriately exercised specific jurisdiction over respondents’ claims.</p>
<p id="c07e672c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, there is no dispute that Bristol-Myers “purposefully avail[ed] itself” of California and its substantial pharmaceutical market. Bristol-Myers employs over 400 people in California and maintains half a dozen facilities in the State engaged in research, development, and policymaking. It contracts with a California-based distributor, McKesson, whose sales account for a significant portion of its revenue. And it markets and sells its drugs, including Plavix, in California, resulting in total Plavix sales in that State of nearly $1 billion during the period relevant to this suit.</p>
<p id="c07e672d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, respondents’ claims “relate to” Bristol-Myers’ in-state conduct. A claim “relates to” a defendant’s forum conduct if it has a “connect[ion] with” that conduct. So respondents could not, for instance, hale Bristol-Myers into court in California for negligently maintaining the sidewalk outside its New York headquarters—a claim that has no connection to acts Bristol-Myers took in California. But respondents’ claims against Bristol-Myers look nothing like such a claim. Respondents’ claims against Bristol-Myers concern conduct materially identical to acts the company took in California: its marketing and distribution of Plavix, which it undertook on a nationwide basis in all 50 States. That respondents were allegedly injured by this nationwide course of conduct in Indiana, Oklahoma, and Texas, and not California, does not mean that their claims do not “relate to” the advertising and distribution efforts that Bristol-Myers undertook in that State. All of the plaintiffs—residents and nonresidents alike—allege that they were injured by the same essential acts. Our cases require no connection more direct than that.</p>
<p id="c07e672e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, and importantly, there is no serious doubt that the exercise of jurisdiction over the nonresidents’ claims is reasonable. Because Bristol-Myers already faces claims that are identical to the nonresidents’ claims in this suit, it will not be harmed by having to defend against respondents’ claims: Indeed, the alternative approach—litigating those claims in separate suits in as many as 34 different States—would prove far more burdensome. By contrast, the plaintiffs’ “interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief” is obviously furthered by participation in a consolidated proceeding in one State under shared counsel, which allows them to minimize costs, share discovery, and maximize recoveries on claims that may be too small to bring on their own. California, too, has an interest in providing a forum for mass actions like this one: Permitting the non-residents to bring suit in California alongside the residents facilitates the efficient adjudication of the residents’ claims and allows it to regulate more effectively the conduct of both nonresident corporations like Bristol-Myers and resident ones like McKesson . . . . </p>
<p id="c07e672f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nothing in the Due Process Clause prohibits a California court from hearing respondents’ claims—at least not in a case where they are joined to identical claims brought by California residents. . . . </p>

Even absent a rigid requirement that a defendant’s in-state conduct must actually cause a plaintiff’s claim,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1120F_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N1120F_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">3</a></span> the upshot of today’s opinion is that plaintiffs cannot join their claims together and sue a defendant in a State in which only some of them have been injured. That rule is likely to have consequences far beyond this case.</p>
<p id="c07e8e42-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, and most prominently, the Court’s opinion in this case will make it profoundly difficult for plaintiffs who are injured in different States by a defendant’s nationwide course of conduct to sue that defendant in a single, consolidated action. The holding of today’s opinion is that such an action cannot be brought in a State in which only some plaintiffs were injured. Not to worry, says the majority: The plaintiffs here could have sued Bristol-Myers in New York or Delaware; could “probably” have subdivided their separate claims into 34 lawsuits in the States in which they were injured; and might have been able to bring a single suit in federal court (an “open. . . . question”). Even setting aside the majority’s caveats, what is the purpose of such limitations? What interests are served by preventing the consolidation of claims and limiting the forums in which they can be consolidated? The effect of the Court’s opinion today is to eliminate nationwide mass actions in any State other than those in which a defendant is “’essentially at home.’”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1121B_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N1121B_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">4</a></span> See <i>Daimler</i>. Such a rule hands one more tool to corporate defendants determined to prevent the aggregation of individual claims, and forces injured plaintiffs to bear the burden of bringing suit in what will often be far flung jurisdictions. . . . </p>
<p id="c07e8e44-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the Court’s opinion today may make it impossible to bring certain mass actions at all. After this case, it is difficult to imagine where it might be possible to bring a nationwide mass action against two or more defendants headquartered and incorporated in different States. There will be no State where both defendants are “at home,” and so no State in which the suit can proceed. What about a nationwide mass action brought against a defendant not headquartered or incorporated in the United States? Such a defendant is not “at home” in any State. . . . </p>
<p id="c07e8e45-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority chides respondents for conjuring a “parade of horribles,” but says nothing about how suits like those described here will survive its opinion in this case. The answer is simple: They will not.</p>

How serious is this problem? Consider several scenarios—keeping in mind that your responses to some of the scenarios may require some knowledge of the financing of litigation and the organization of the plaintiffs’ bar—topics touched on in Chapter 5.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c07edc76-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From the plaintiffs’ standpoint, the easiest cases to bring will be those in which a defective product seriously injures or kills a number of people. Because damages in each case will be substantial, it will usually be possible for such plaintiffs to find competent counsel to represent each plaintiff (or small groups of plaintiffs) individually—in which case it will not matter whether the cases can be consolidated. That leaves, however, the <i>Nicastro</i> situation: a product manufactured outside the United States and not widely distributed—but which inflicts a serious injury.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c07edc77-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And, even if there are substantial individual damages, where can those persons sue? One might assume that they could do so in whatever state they purchased the drug in question. But consider a possibly significant sentence toward the end of the majority opinion: “Alternatively, the plaintiffs who are residents of a particular State—for example, the 92 plaintiffs from Texas and the 71 from Ohio—could <i>probably</i> sue together in their home States.” (Italics added.) “Probably” may merely represent Justice Alito exercising the caution of a good judge in a common law system: Don’t make unnecessary pronouncements about cases not before the court. Or might he mean something else, suggesting that for jurisdiction to lie a defendant must have “purposefully directed” (<i>Nicastro</i>) activity toward the state in question? One feels certain that defendants will probe this question in future cases.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c07edc78-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now consider: What if damages in individual cases were insufficient to warrant individual representation—as may have been the situation in <i>Bristol</i>-<i>Myers</i>?</p>

<li class=""><p id="c07edc79-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From the plaintiffs’ standpoint, the ideal would be either a class action (unlikely for reasons you’ll better understand when you encounter that device in Chapter 12) or, putting that aside, “bundling” a number of individual cases together as the lawyers in <i>Bristol-Myers</i> sought to do. How difficult will that be to do? The answer may well depend on how well organized the segment of the plaintiffs’ bar that handles such cases is. For example, the “pharmaceutical bar” on the plaintiffs’ side in the United States is relatively small (comprising scores or perhaps a hundred or so lawyers who regularly handle such cases and who can deploy the considerable resources, intellectual and financial, needed to prosecute them), and the members of this bar have various informal arrangements with each other that facilitate cooperation. One imagines that they would be able to organize aggregate representation of the <i>Bristol-Myers</i> plaintiffs without much difficulty if the stakes warranted it. And there are many such specialized “bars,” with expertise ranging from cruise ship accidents to tire safety and on and on.</p></li>

This is not a topic that the Supreme Court has frequently addressed, but perhaps, given this statement, it will do so soon. Or, is the Court pointing toward Congress?

That criterion was first announced in <i>Pennoyer v. Neff</i>, in which we stated that due process “mean[s] a course of legal proceedings according to those rules and principles which have been established in our systems of jurisprudence for the protection and enforcement of private rights,” including the “well-established principles of public law respecting the jurisdiction of an independent State over persons and property.” In what has become the classic expression of the criterion, we said in International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310 (1945), that a State Court’s assertion of personal jurisdiction satisfies the Due Process Clause if it does not violate “’traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice’” [quoting <i>Milliken v. Meyer</i>]. Since <i>International Shoe</i>, we have only been called upon to decide whether these “traditional notions” permit States to exercise jurisdiction over absent defendants in a manner that deviates from the rules of jurisdiction applied in the 19th century. We have held such deviations permissible, but only with respect to suits arising out of the absent defendant’s contacts with the State. The question we must decide today is whether due process requires a similar connection between the litigation and the defendant’s contacts with the State in cases where the defendant is physically present in the State at the time process is served upon him.</p>

<p id="c07f039d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Among the most firmly established principles of personal jurisdiction in American tradition is that the courts of a State have jurisdiction over nonresidents who are physically present in the State. The view developed early that each State had the power to hale before its courts any individual who could be found within its borders, and that once having acquired jurisdiction over such a person by properly serving him with process, the State could retain jurisdiction to enter judgment against him, no matter how fleeting his visit. See, e.g., Potter v. Allin, 2 Root 63, 67 (Conn. 1793); <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="150" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page150">p. 150</span>Barrell v. Benjamin, 15 Mass. 354 (1819). That view had antecedents in English common-law practice, which sometimes allowed “transitory” actions, arising out of events outside the country, to be maintained against seemingly nonresident defendants who were present in England. . . . </p>
<p id="c07f039e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recent scholarship has suggested that English tradition was not as clear [as Supreme Court Justice and treatise writer Joseph Story thought it was]. . . . Accurate or not, however, judging by the evidence of contemporaneous. . . . decisions, one must conclude that Story’s understanding was shared by American courts at the crucial time for present purposes: 1868, when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted.</p>

We daresay a contractual exchange swapping those benefits for that power would not survive the “unconscionability” provision of the Uniform Commercial Code. . . . </p>

Regardless of whether Justice Story’s account of the rule’s genesis is mythical, our common understanding now, fortified by a century of judicial practice, is that jurisdiction is often a function of geography. The transient rule is consistent with reasonable expectations and is entitled to a strong presumption that it comports with due process. . . . “If I visit another State,. . . . I knowingly assume some risk that the State will exercise its power over my property or my person while there.

His health and safety are guaranteed by the State’s police, fire, and emergency medical services; he is free to travel on the State’s roads and waterways; he likely enjoys the fruits of the State’s economy as well. Moreover, the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV prevents a state government from discriminating against a transient defendant by denying him the protections of its law or the right of access to its courts. . . . Without transient jurisdiction, an asymmetry would arise: a transient would have the full benefit of the power of the forum State’s courts as a plaintiff while retaining immunity from their authority as a defendant.</p>

<p id="c07fc724-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Assume Abe, a resident of Illinois, sues Barbara, a resident of California, in Illinois, and notifies Barbara of the suit. Barbara thinks that she is not subject to personal jurisdiction. What does her lawyer do?</p>
<p id="c07fc725-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The simplest but riskiest course is for Barbara’s lawyer to do nothing. If she is very sure indeed that the court lacks jurisdiction (and she has no assets in Illinois), she may simply decline to appear, suffer a default judgment, and attack the judgment when Abe seeks to enforce it in a subsequent proceeding. Before Abe can enforce the Illinois judgment in California, he must file it with a California court. Barbara will receive notice of that filing, and with it an opportunity to contest the Illinois court’s jurisdiction over her before the California court issues a writ of execution against Barbara’s assets in California. Even before <i>Pennoyer</i>, that route—known as collateral attack—lay open. D’Arcy v. Ketchum, 52 U.S. 165 (1850). It carries, however, a serious risk, for if the second court rejects the jurisdictional challenge, Barbara can raise no other defenses on the merits. Jurisdiction, but only jurisdiction, is open to collateral attack.</p>

How does she raise jurisdictional objections in the first proceeding?</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c07fee37-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the Federal Rules (and state statutes patterned on them), Barbara may raise her jurisdictional defense either in the answer or, if she makes a pre-answer motion, at that time. Read Rule 12(b), (h), and (g). These provisions of Rule 12 make sequencing critical. Making any pre-answer motion that omits a defense of personal jurisdiction is treated as a waiver of objection to jurisdiction. By the same token, making an appearance or litigating other issues but failing to challenge personal jurisdiction in one of these two ways results in waiver of the jurisdictional defense. If Barbara raises the objection at the proper time, she does not waive it by joining it with other defenses or objections, but she must raise it the first time she raises any issue, either by way of motion, appearance, or answer. Moreover, she must litigate the defense promptly. This happens as a matter of course if she makes a pre-answer motion. If she makes no such motion but challenges jurisdiction in her answer, she must promptly move for dismissal on this ground. Although the Rules do not say so explicitly, courts will not look kindly on a defendant who waits until the end of discovery to see how the wind is blowing on the merits of the case before moving to dismiss for want of personal jurisdiction.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c07fee38-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a few state systems (and in many older cases), Barbara would raise the jurisdictional claim by making a “special appearance.” See, e.g., Tex. R. Civ. P. 120a (Bender 2011). This is what Dennis Burnham did. The procedure is so called for reasons you can now understand: Otherwise, a defendant who “appeared” might be held to have consented to the state’s exercise of power. What was needed was a form of “appearance” that would not be treated as presence or consent. A “special” appearance permitted the defendant to object to jurisdiction without the action of objecting being itself the basis for jurisdiction.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c07fee39-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, what happens if the defendant has availed herself of the system’s opportunity to challenge jurisdiction but loses? May she immediately appeal that decision? Some states do permit such an immediate appeal; indeed sometimes they require an immediate appeal of the jurisdictional ruling—treating the choice to litigate on the merits as waiving the jurisdictional defense. Other states and the federal system treat a jurisdictional defense like other pretrial rulings and require that an appeal await final judgment. If you were a defendant with a jurisdictional defense, which pattern would you prefer? If you were a plaintiff, which would you prefer?</p></li>

<p id="c0801555-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As you have seen, Rule 12(b) allows a defense of lack of personal jurisdiction to be raised either by pre-answer motion or as part of the answer (if, but only if, there has been no pre-answer motion). Why would a defendant choose a pre-answer motion rather than simply bundling everything into her answer to the complaint?</p>
<p id="c0801556-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One straightforward answer is that with a 12(b) motion, the defendant stands to get the case against him dismissed. But there are some other, less obvious reasons a defendant might prefer moving instead of answering in some cases. To get an idea of one possible reason, read Rules 8(b) and 11, which put the lawyer’s professional standing—and also her pocketbook—behind the allegations of an answer: Rule 8(b) requires that an answer respond to each allegation in a complaint—either admitting or denying it; Rule 11 requires that each such admission <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="158" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page158">p. 158</span>or denial be adequately grounded in law and fact—with court-ordered sanctions possible for violations. Accordingly, an attorney answering a complaint on behalf of a defendant must take the time (and, sometimes, money) to ensure that her answers to each paragraph in the complaint comport with Rule 11. For a short, straightforward complaint, answering will likely take less time than moving to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction (particularly if briefing the jurisdictional issue requires investigation and discovery, as it did in <i>Hawkins,</i> in Chapter 1). But in a case with complex facts and a straightforward jurisdictional defense, it might be more efficient to move to dismiss than to answer.</p>
<p id="c0801557-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 13 supplies another reason: It requires that an answer contain any counterclaim arising out of the same transaction as the claim. In some cases it might require substantial factual and legal research to decide if a viable counterclaim exists.</p>
<p id="c0801558-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not only money and professional requirements but also time is at stake. Rule 12(b) gives the defendant just 21 days to answer (unless time is extended or the defendant waives service of process). That may be a short time if the lawyer has to do substantial factual investigation to decide on the strategy of the answer. Rule 12(a)(4) extends the time to answer until 14 days after the court has ruled on a pre-answer motion; accordingly a Rule 12 motion buys the defendant additional weeks or months before any answer is required (if it is required at all—the defendant, of course, need not answer a complaint once it has been dismissed!). But be wary about treating a Rule 12 motion as a “free” time extension: The lawyer’s required signature on such a motion constitutes a certificate that “it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to. . . . cause unnecessary delay.” Rule 11(b)(1).</p>

<p id="c080155b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recall <i>Pennoyer</i>’s indication that either power or consent could establish jurisdiction. That proposition remains true today: A defendant may, either at the outset of the lawsuit itself or before it, consent to jurisdiction in a forum. As we have just noted, the Rules reflect this principle: A party with a potential defense based on personal jurisdiction waives that defense by failing to assert it at an early stage of litigation—either in a pre-answer motion or in the answer.</p>
<p id="c080155c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the broader significance of consent as a basis for jurisdiction long remained buried. Before <i>International Shoe</i> the cases that spoke of “consent” often referred to consent implied from presence, or from what modern jurisdictional analysis would refer to as contacts. Such contacts can provide a perfectly adequate basis for jurisdiction, but they are not consent in any strong sense of the word. Since <i>International Shoe</i> recharacterized those implied consent cases as contacts, it has become easier to focus on what one might call “real” consent, a specific agreement to submit to jurisdiction. Cases since <i>International Shoe</i> have greatly expanded parties’ ability to use consent as a jurisdictional tool; as you would expect, this tool finds its most frequent use in cases in which the parties have some prior contractual dealings.</p>
<p id="c080155d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The starting point is National Equipment Rental v. Szukhent, 375 U.S. 311 (1964). The Szukhents, Michigan farmers, leased farm equipment from a New York <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="159" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page159">p. 159</span>concern. On the back of the lease form was a clause saying that the Szukhents “designate[] Florence Weinberg [at a New York City address] as agent for the purpose of accepting service of process.” When the Szukhents defaulted on the lease, plaintiff sued in New York, serving process on Ms. Weinberg (who notified defendants of the suit), and basing jurisdiction on such service. The Supreme Court upheld this procedure, treating the quoted clause as consent to personal jurisdiction and holding that under the circumstances the clause did not violate due process.</p>
<p id="c080155e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why would National Equipment want such a clause? The most likely reason is that it would reduce costs and increase convenience—National Equipment could use its regular lawyer, who would be a member of the New York bar, and would not have to incur the costs of finding lawyers in whatever states it rented its farm equipment. If required to testify, the company’s officers could do so without disrupting its business. Moreover, National Equipment might have liked that lower costs and greater convenience for it meant increased costs and inconvenience for the Szukhents and others similarly situated. And, in the event a dispute went to trial, it would be before a New York rather than a Michigan jury, which might view the New Yorkers less favorably in a dispute with “one of their own.”</p>
<p id="c080155f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>National Equipment Rental</i>, the parties manipulated jurisdictional rules contractually, the Szukhents consenting to a New York jurisdiction that would not likely have existed without that clause. Notice, however, that the clause in <i>National Equipment Rental</i> permitted service in New York but did not require suit to be brought there; so far as the contract was concerned, the Szukhents could have sued National Equipment Rental in Michigan, and National Equipment could have sued the Szukhents there as well. The next case takes matters further. (A word about substantive background may ease understanding: Federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction over admiralty matters, which include the interpretation of contracts calling for carriage of passengers by sea.)</p>

In this context, it would be entirely unreasonable for us to assume that respondents—or any other cruise passenger—would negotiate with petitioner the terms of a forum-selection clause in an ordinary commercial cruise ticket. Common sense dictates that a ticket of this kind will be a form contract the terms of which are not subject to negotiation, and that an individual purchasing the ticket will not have bargaining parity with the cruise line. . . . </p>
<p id="c0803c85-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Including a reasonable forum clause in a form contract of this kind well may be permissible for several reasons: First, a cruise line has a special interest in limiting the fora in which it potentially could be subject to suit. Because a cruise ship typically carries passengers from many locales, it is not unlikely that a mishap on a cruise could subject the cruise line to litigation in several different fora. Additionally, a clause establishing ex ante the forum for dispute resolution has the salutary effect of dispelling any confusion about where suits arising from the contract must be brought and defended, sparing litigants the time and expense of pretrial motions to determine the correct forum and conserving judicial resources that otherwise would be devoted to deciding those motions. Finally, it stands to reason that passengers who purchase tickets containing a forum clause like that at issue in this case benefit in the form of reduced fares reflecting the savings that the cruise line enjoys by limiting the fora in which it may be sued. . . . </p>
<p id="c0806396-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It bears emphasis that forum-selection clauses contained in form passage contracts are subject to judicial scrutiny for fundamental fairness. In this case, there is no indication that petitioner set Florida as the forum in which disputes were to be resolved as a means of discouraging cruise passengers from pursuing legitimate claims. Any suggestion of such a bad-faith motive is belied by two facts: Petitioner has its principal place of business in Florida, and many of its cruises depart from and return to Florida ports. Similarly, there is no evidence that petitioner obtained respondents’ accession to the forum clause by fraud or overreaching. Finally, respondents have conceded that they were given notice of the forum provision and, therefore, presumably retained the option of rejecting the contract with impunity. In the case before us, therefore, we conclude that the Court of Appeals erred in refusing to enforce the forum-selection clause. . . . </p>

Pursuant to the first strand, courts traditionally have reviewed with heightened scrutiny the terms of contracts of adhesion, form contracts offered on a take-or-leave basis by a party with stronger bargaining power to a party with weaker power. Some commentators have questioned whether contracts of adhesion can justifiably be enforced at all under traditional contract theory because the adhering party generally enters into them without manifesting knowing and voluntary consent to all their terms. . . . </p>
<p id="c0806399-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second doctrinal principle implicated by forum-selection clauses is the traditional rule that “contractual provisions, which seek to limit the place or court in which an action may. . . . be brought, are invalid as contrary to public policy.” Although adherence to this general rule has declined in recent years, particularly <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="162" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page162">p. 162</span>following our decision in The Bremen v.

One of the hallmarks of U.S. law is the extent to which the rules of procedure are “default” rules, rules that govern if the parties have not agreed to something else. Forum selection clauses provide an example of the parties’ ability to make agreements that displace ordinary procedural rules. The clause is a contractual provision. As Justice Stevens’s dissent suggests, courts approaching such clauses will always have at least two questions to consider:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c08063a5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, as a matter of contract law, is the clause enforceable? (The same question arises in respect to agreements to arbitrate, as you will learn in Chapter 8.)</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0808ab9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Forum selection clauses lie in the middle of a spectrum of contractual provisions that affect procedure; all are common parts of many contracts. Lawyers drafting contracts must consider whether any or all of these types of clauses would be helpful to their clients.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0808aba-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Choice of law</i> clauses do not purport to say where suit shall be brought but do provide that the substantive law of a particular jurisdiction will govern disputes arising under the contract. The contract in <i>Burger King</i> (supra page 109) contained such a clause, which specified that Florida law would govern the agreement. (The Burger King franchise agreement did not contain a forum selection clause; compare the date of that case to <i>Carnival Cruise Lines</i> and imagine why Burger King’s lawyers may have hesitated to insert a forum selection clause in that contract.)</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0808abb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Consent-to-jurisdiction</i> clauses say that the parties (or one of the parties) consent to suit in a particular place, thus waiving challenges to personal jurisdiction.

<p id="c0808ac2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Pennoyer</i> established an analytic scheme with three branches—power, consent, and notice. This exploration of personal jurisdiction has so far focused on the first two of these branches. Reflecting on the case law examined so far, one could conclude <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="164" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page164">p. 164</span>that in order to exercise jurisdiction over a defendant a forum state must have <i>either</i> power (flowing from the kind of relationships discussed in the contacts cases) <i>or</i> the defendant’s consent. Consent may come either in the form of a prelitigation agreement (as in <i>Carnival Cruise Lines v. Shute</i>) or by waiver (when defendant appears but fails to challenge jurisdiction).</p>
<p id="c0808ac3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The facts of <i>Pennoyer</i>, however, suggested another basic objection to the exercise of a state’s power. In <i>Mitchell v. Neff</i>, the lawsuit preceding <i>Pennoyer v. Neff</i>, the only notice given to the defendant was a small-print advertisement appearing in the pages of a legal newspaper. In the lower court Neff argued that the statute authorizing notice in this form had not been complied with, and the lower court had reversed on this ground. The U.S. Supreme Court split on the question of statutory interpretation and went on to rest its decision on the absence of power. Because the Court equated power with personal service of process, the question of notice remained buried for some decades: Personal service of process on the defendant within the state simultaneously asserted power and gave notice.</p>
<p id="c0808ac4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issues of power and notice began to diverge as states expanded the concept of consent. For example, in Wuchter v. Pizzutti, 276 U.S. 13 (1928), a precursor of <i>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust</i>, infra, the Supreme Court considered a New Jersey nonresident motorist statute. It treated the use of the state’s roads by nonresidents as consent to both jurisdiction in auto accident cases and to the appointment of the Secretary of State as the agent of the defendant for service of process. But the statute did not explicitly direct the Secretary to give notice to the nonresident driver. Even though the defendant had in fact received notice, the Court struck down the statute.</p>
<p id="c0808ac5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Cases like <i>Wuchter</i> made it clear that individuals being sued <i>in personam</i> must receive some form of notice. But again recall the distinction, recognized by <i>Pennoyer</i>, between <i>in personam</i> and <i>in rem</i> jurisdiction. As the <i>Pennoyer</i> Court saw things, because it was perfectly permissible for a state to assume that people kept an eye on their property, a state could presume that the seizure of property (a necessary prerequisite to <i>in rem</i> jurisdiction, you will recall) would also accomplish notice. Behind this rather cavalier assumption may have been an understandable concern. If states were to exercise control over land titles, they had to have some method of rendering binding judgments; a rule that permitted landowners to avoid jurisdiction simply by wandering off without leaving an address would be intolerable. The willingness to presume notice from seizure was a rough but effective way of ensuring that this situation did not arise. But it also posed a potentially troubling question—could a state also dispense with notice if the whereabouts of the property owner <i>were</i> known? The next case, a constitutional landmark, addresses that question.</p>

<p id="c080d800-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In two ways, this proceeding does or may deprive beneficiaries of property. It may cut off their rights to have the trustee answer for negligent or illegal impairments of their interests. Also, their interests are presumably subject to diminution in the proceeding by allowance of fees and expenses to one who, in their names but without their knowledge, may conduct a fruitless or uncompensatory contest. Certainly the proceeding is one in which they may be deprived of property rights and hence notice and hearing must measure up to the standards of due process.</p>
<p id="c080d801-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Personal service of written notice within the jurisdiction is the classic form of notice always adequate in any type of proceeding. But the vital interest of the State in bringing any issues as to its fiduciaries to a final settlement can be served only if interests or claims of individuals who are outside of the State can somehow be determined. A construction of the Due Process Clause which would place impossible or impractical obstacles in the way could not be justified.</p>
<p id="c080d802-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Against this interest of the State we must balance the individual interest sought to be protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. This is defined by our holding that “[t]he fundamental requisite of due process of law is the opportunity to be heard.” This right to be heard has little reality or worth unless one is informed that the matter is pending and can choose for himself whether to appear or default, acquiesce or contest.</p>
<p id="c080d803-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court has not committed itself to any formula achieving a balance between these interests in a particular proceeding or determining when constructive notice may be utilized or what test it must meet. Personal service has not in all circumstances been regarded as indispensable to the process due to residents, and it has more often been held unnecessary as to nonresidents. We disturb none of the established rules on these subjects. No decision constitutes a controlling, or even a very illuminating, precedent for the case before us, but a few general principles stand out in the books.</p>
<p id="c080d804-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections. The notice must be of such nature as reasonably to convey the required information, and it must afford a reasonable time for those interested to make their appearance. But if with due regard for the practicalities and peculiarities of the case these conditions are reasonably met, the constitutional requirements are satisfied. . . . </p>

<p id="c080d806-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It would be idle to pretend that publication alone, as prescribed here, is a reliable means of acquainting interested parties of the fact that their rights are before the courts. It is not an accident that the greater number of cases reaching this Court on the question of adequacy of notice have been concerned with actions founded on process constructively served through local newspapers. Chance alone brings to the attention of even a local resident an advertisement in small type inserted in the back pages of a newspaper, and if he makes his home outside the area of the newspaper’s normal circulation the odds that the information will never reach him are large indeed. The chance of actual notice is further reduced when, as here, the notice required does not even name those whose attention it is supposed to attract, and does not inform acquaintances who might call it to attention. In weighing its sufficiency on the basis of equivalence with actual notice, we are unable to regard this as more than a feint.</p>
<p id="c080d807-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor is publication here reinforced by steps likely to attract the parties’ attention to the proceeding. It is true that publication traditionally has been acceptable as notification supplemental to other action [such as attachment or seizure] which in itself may reasonably be expected to convey a warning. [But, the Court finds, there is no comparable other action providing notice here.]</p>
<p id="c080d808-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court has not hesitated to approve of resort to publication as a customary substitute in another class of cases where it is not reasonably possible or practicable to give more adequate warning. Thus it has been recognized that, in the case of persons missing or unknown, employment of an indirect and even a probably futile means of notification is all that the situation permits and creates no constitutional bar to a final decree foreclosing their rights.</p>
<p id="c080ff19-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those beneficiaries represented by appellant whose interests or whereabouts could not with due diligence be ascertained come clearly within this category. As to them the statutory notice is sufficient. However great the odds that publication will never reach the eyes of such unknown parties, it is not in the typical case much more likely to fail than any of the choices open to legislators endeavoring to prescribe the best notice practicable.</p>
<p id="c080ff1a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor do we consider it unreasonable for the State to dispense with more certain notice to those beneficiaries whose interests are either conjectural or future or, although they could be discovered upon investigation, do not in due course of business come to knowledge of the common trustee. . . . [W]e have no doubt that. . . . impracticable and extended searches are not required in the name of due process. . . . These are practical matters in which we should be reluctant to disturb the judgment of the state authorities.</p>
<p id="c080ff1b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly we overrule appellant’s constitutional objections to published notice insofar as they are urged on behalf of any beneficiaries whose interests or addresses are unknown to the trustee.</p>

Exceptions in the name of necessity do not sweep away the rule that within the limits of practicability notice must be such as is reasonably calculated to reach interested parties. Where the names and post-office addresses of those affected by a proceeding are at hand, the reasons disappear for resort to means less likely than the mails to apprise them of its pendency.</p>
<p id="c080ff1d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trustee has on its books the names and addresses of the income beneficiaries represented by appellant, and we find no tenable ground for dispensing with a serious effort to inform them personally of the accounting, at least by ordinary mail to the record addresses. Certainly sending them a copy of the statute months and perhaps years in advance does not answer this purpose. The trustee periodically remits their income to them, and we think that they might reasonably expect that with or apart from their remittances word might come to them personally that steps were being taken affecting their interests.</p>
<p id="c080ff1e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We need not weigh contentions that a requirement of personal service of citation on even the large number of known resident or nonresident beneficiaries would, by reasons of delay if not of expense, seriously interfere with the proper administration of the fund. . . . However, no such service is required under the circumstances. This type of trust presupposes a large number of small interests. The individual interest does not stand alone but is identical with that of a class. The rights of each in the integrity of the fund and the fidelity of the trustee are shared by many other beneficiaries. Therefore notice reasonably certain to reach most of those interested in objecting is likely to safeguard the interests of all, since any objection sustained would inure to the benefit of all. We think that under such circumstances reasonable risks that notice might not actually reach every beneficiary are justifiable. . . . The statutory notice to known beneficiaries is inadequate, not because in fact it fails to reach everyone, but because under the circumstances it is not reasonably calculated to reach those who could easily be informed by other means at hand. However it may have been in former times, the mails today are recognized as an efficient and inexpensive means of communication. Moreover, the fact that the trust company has been able to give mailed notice to known beneficiaries at the time the common trust fund was established is persuasive that postal notification at the time of accounting would not seriously burden the plan. . . . </p>
<p id="c080ff1f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Certainly it is instructive, in determining the reasonableness of the impersonal broadcast notification here used, to ask whether it would satisfy a prudent man of business, counting his pennies but finding it in his interest to convey information to many persons whose names and addresses are in his files. We are not satisfied that it would. . . . </p>
<p id="c080ff20-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We hold that the notice of judicial settlement of accounts required by the New York Banking Law §100-c(12) is incompatible with the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment as a basis for adjudication depriving known persons whose whereabouts are also known of substantial property rights. Accordingly the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>

After the decision, what steps would have to occur to assure that the proceeding would bind the beneficiaries? For the approach taken by the State of New York, see N.Y.

<li class=""><p id="c081263c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Mullane,</i> mass mailings were deemed satisfactory. The Court acknowledged that some letters would not get through to their intended recipients but reasoned that because all intended recipients had the same interests, contacting a certain number of people in the group would serve approximately the same function as contacting them all. How would this principle apply to ordinary litigation, in which only a few parties are involved: Is mail adequate then? The answer matters because mail notice reduces the cost of serving process while also increasing the risk that the mail will not reach its addressee.</p></li>

The issue matters greatly in class actions—where both sides in the debate cite <i>Mullane</i>, one stressing its requirement of individual notice, the other stressing its emphasis on practicality. Rule 23(c)(2) straddles the question, requiring individualized notice for some classes with others receiving only “appropriate” notice.

<li class=""><p id="c0814d50-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subsequent cases have made it clear that only very unusual circumstances justify failure to give personal notice to any defendant whose identity and whereabouts are known and who is not seeking to evade service. E.g., Walker v. Hutchinson, 352 U.S. 112 (1956) (property seized for condemnation); Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc. v. Pope, 485 U.S. 478 (1985) (settlement of decedent’s estate; published notice to creditors in general insufficient when estate knew of claim of particular creditor); Connecticut v.

<li class=""><p id="c0814d51-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One case in this line, Jones v. Flowers, 547 U.S. 220 (2006), goes further—extending to a situation where the owner’s location was not known. In a tax sale, the state authorities sent two certified mail notices to the last known address of the owner who, however, had moved after a marital separation. After the sale had occurred the owner sued to set it aside, citing his failure to get notice. The Supreme Court agreed, indicating that the state should have taken additional steps, without precisely specifying what they were—except that it rejected the idea that the authorities had the obligation to consult other sources, such as the telephone directory or income tax rolls, which would have revealed the new address. Given the low cost of digital searches under current conditions, one can imagine circumstances in which a court would hold that due process requires such a search in order to notify one whose property is about to be taken.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0814d52-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At least one court has taken the availability of digital technology a step further. A New York wife was seeking a divorce. She could not locate her husband to serve process in a conventional way, but he maintained a Facebook account. The judge granted the wife permission to serve process via a Facebook message—so long as the defendant’s Facebook account acknowledged receipt of the notice. http://time.com/3772614/facebook-divorce-summons-blood-dzraku/.</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0814d54-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By “service of process,” courts sometimes refer to the way in which the defendant is given notice of the action—the question with which <i>Mullane</i> deals. At other times they use the same phrase to refer instead to the extent of a court’s adjudicatory power—minimum contacts and the like. This blending occurs because, so long as transient jurisdiction is valid, service of process within a state’s borders may confer jurisdiction as well as giving notice (as in <i>Burnham v. Superior Court</i>, supra page 148). Courts and statutes thus speak of “service of process” when they mean jurisdiction or a combination of jurisdiction and service. (The Federal Interpleader Act, 28 U.S.C. §2361, for example, speaks of nationwide “process,” but has been uniformly interpreted to mean nationwide personal jurisdiction.)</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0814d55-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Conversely, courts that conclude that a defendant did not receive constitutionally adequate notice (as in <i>Mullane</i>) will sometimes express that conclusion by saying that the court lacked “jurisdiction”; that is, it lacked one of the constitutional requisites for exercising adjudicatory power—proper notice.</p></li>

<p id="c0819b86-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Assuming that some constitutionally adequate notice is required, one must then decide what exact form notice must take. That form is widely regulated by statute. Rule 4 provides that regulation in federal courts. The current Rule 4 consolidates <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="173" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page173">p. 173</span>a gradual informalizing of the practice of service of process that has taken place over the last few decades, an evolution enabled in part by <i>Mullane</i>’s suggestion that forms of notice other than personal service would satisfy due process. In pursuit of informality, Rule 4 makes service by an officer of the court (a U.S. marshal) exceptional rather than ordinary. In its place, the Rule provides for service by any person who is not a party and is at least 18 years old. More fundamentally, Rule 4 proposes to replace even this personal but “unofficial” service with a still less formal procedure called “waiver of service” (see Rule 4(d)). Waiver of service uses first-class mail to send a copy of the complaint to the defendant, together with a request that the defendant return a form (found after Rule 4) by mail, waiving formal service of a summons. If the defendant returns that form, the case proceeds as if process had been served. If the defendant does not return the form within the time specified in the Rule, the plaintiff must then proceed to have a summons served more formally, using the procedures set forth in Rule 4(e)-(j). The defendant who waives service does not thereby waive objections to venue or jurisdiction, or any defenses to the merits of the lawsuit. By waiving service the defendant does, however, waive any objections to the sufficiency of the summons or the method by which it was served (Rule 12(b)(4) and (5)).</p>

<ul class="">
<li><p id="c0819b89-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 4 avoided a long-simmering debate about whether ordinary mail is good enough for personal service of process. It uses ordinary mail, all right, but not to <i>serve</i> process; instead it requests a “waiver” that makes formal service unnecessary—even though the request for waiver accomplishes exactly the same notice function as service.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p id="c081c29a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why should the defendant want to make things easy for the plaintiff by waiving formal service of process? Rule 4 provides two answers to that question—a stick for failing to waive and a carrot for doing so. Rule 4(d)(1) imposes on defendants the “duty to avoid unnecessary expenses of serving the summons.” The “stick” enforcing that duty is Rule 4(d)(2) requiring a “defendant located within the United States” to pay the costs of subsequent service if he has without good cause refused to waive service of process. The carrot appears in Rule 12(a)(1)(A)(ii), which extends the time to answer the complaint—from 21 to 60 days for domestic defendants and from 21 to 90 days for foreign defendants. The accompanying notes reflect a hope that this combination of procedural sticks and carrots will make waiver the predominant form of service in federal litigation. If the defendant fails to waive service, Rule 4 goes on to specify various means by which a plaintiff may serve defendants. Plaintiff must also use these means to serve defendants from whom a waiver of service cannot be demanded. Such defendants include the U.S. government, minors <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="174" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page174">p. 174</span>and incompetents, and others whose service is thought to require special formality so as to reduce the possibility of inadvertent default. Anecdotal accounts suggest that neither the carrot nor the stick has been large enough to make waiver the dominant form of notice.</p>
<p id="c081c29b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where formal service is required, its form depends on the nature of the defendant—individuals and corporations, domestic and foreign defendants, and federal and state government entities all have sections. The Rule specifies the means of serving foreign defendants, a source of special problems and growing concern as the volume of international business increases. Rule 4(f) and (h) set forth a list of ways in which such foreign defendants may be served, incorporating the provisions of the Hague Service Convention of 1969, an important international treaty.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c081c29f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff requests a waiver of service of summons from Defendant located in the United States, receives no waiver, and incurs the costs of personal service.

How will a court likely rule?</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class=""><p id="c081c2a0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Service of process gives a defendant notice and thus overcomes what would otherwise be a constitutional obstacle to a valid judgment. Service may also avoid a defense based on the statute of limitations; in many states the statute is satisfied not by filing the suit but only by serving defendant with process. For claims based on federal law, Rule 3 provides that the statute of limitations stops running when the complaint is filed with the court; but defendant must still be notified. The Supreme Court has twice made clear that in diversity actions to which such state statutes apply, actual service (or waiver) is required to satisfy the statute of limitations—in spite of whatever Rule 3 says.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c081c2a1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 4 makes one proposition explicit that has been implicit since <i>Pennoyer v. Neff</i> and another that the Rules have long skirted: the relation between personal jurisdiction and service of process, and the relation between the reach of personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c081c2a2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the first issue, Rule 4(k)(1) states that service (or waiver) establishes jurisdiction over defendants subject to personal jurisdiction. That formula is as important for what it does not say as for what it does. It does <i>not</i> say that service establishes jurisdiction. That had been the assumption of <i>Pennoyer</i>, at least for defendants served in the forum state. Instead, the Rule states that <i>if</i> the requisites of personal jurisdiction exist, proper service establishes jurisdiction. Thus a defendant who waives process, or who has been properly served, remains free to challenge the existence of personal jurisdiction.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c081c2a3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="175" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page175">p. 175</span>On the second issue—the personal jurisdiction of federal courts—Rule 4 establishes a four-tier scheme. First, it says that federal courts, at a minimum, have personal jurisdiction over any defendant over whom the state court of the forum state would have such jurisdiction (Rule 4(k)(1)(A)). To that extent—and this provision covers the vast majority of all cases—the personal jurisdiction of state and federal courts “match.” Thus a federal court sitting in California or Georgia has the same jurisdictional reach as a state court in that state—no less, but also no more.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c081c2a4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The three remaining provisions deal with situations in which the Rule defines a longer jurisdictional reach for the federal courts than the state courts would have. One occurs when a party is joined to litigation under Rule 14 or 19; in these instances, the Rules provide for a “100-mile bulge” in the personal jurisdiction of a federal district court, even if a state court would not have had such jurisdiction (Rule 4(k)(1)(B)). This provision is particularly useful where federal district courts lie close to state lines: the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York (Manhattan and Brooklyn) and the district courts in New Jersey, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and Delaware are examples.</p>
<p id="c081e9b5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another special situation arises when federal legislation specifically provides for broad, national power of a federal court. One example is a federal statute providing for nationwide service of process (for example, see 28 U.S.C. §1335); another is the enforcement of a civil contempt order arising from litigation involving a federal question Rule 4.1(b).</p>
<p id="c081e9b6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the Rule purports to define a new form of personal jurisdiction, limited to federal claims against defendants not subject to personal jurisdiction in any state. Such defendants will inevitably be foreign persons or entities that have insufficient contacts with any single state to create personal jurisdiction. In that situation, Rule 4(k)(2) provides:</p>

</div>
<p id="c081e9ba-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This provision rests on the proposition that the Due Process Clause permits aggregation of the defendant’s contacts with the United States as a whole for jurisdictional purposes—a question raised in several cases but not definitively resolved. As a quick review of this chapter so far, explain why Rule 4(k)(2) would not have helped the plaintiff in <i>J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro</i>, supra page 111.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c081e9bb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Assuming one knows the proper mode of service, questions still arise over whether the attempted service conformed to the statutory requirements. For example, has the process server left process “with someone of suitable age and discretion” as required by Rule 4(e)(2)(B)? Or what if the process server submits an affidavit that the defendant was served, but defendant denies it? Such questions will often require a hearing and judicial resolution. They may arise, for example, in a motion made under Rule 60(b) to set aside a default judgment <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="176" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page176">p. 176</span>(as in <i>Peralta</i>, at page 525). They may also arise in those states in which the statute of limitations does not stop running until process is served. And, service may be quashed on defendant’s motion at the preliminary stages of the case for improprieties of form even though the service has performed its chief function—that of notifying the defendant of the commencement of the case.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c081e9bc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Failure to deliver service may benefit the process server if his failures are not caught, because he can collect the fees and not do the work. Such intentional failure to serve process, accompanied by a false affidavit of service, is called “sewer service” by reference to the place where process eventually finds itself. Such abuses may also benefit the plaintiff, who may be able to collect a default judgment based on the sewer service because the defendant was intimidated by the judgment collection process, was ignorant of his rights, or could not afford a lawyer.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c081e9bd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other side of the coin, defendants may sometimes take unfair advantage of service-of-process rules. Wily prospective defendants have sometimes dodged process for long periods, thereby requiring process servers to display ingenuity and sometimes even physical bravery. What should be done with such defendants, who refuse to waive service and then evade the process server? Rule 4(d), which imposes the duty to minimize costs of service on defendants and shifts those costs to a defendant who makes expensive personal service necessary, is one response; Rule 4(m), extending the time for service “if the plaintiff shows good cause,” is another. But such a defendant must be served as a prerequisite even for collecting those costs of service, not to speak of the relief sought on the merits of the lawsuit.</p></li>

<p id="c08210d1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To save parties from such potential problems the Hague Service Convention, an important international treaty covering service of process, aims at clarifying the means of serving judicial process abroad. The Hague Convention would, for example, guide a Japanese firm seeking to serve a U.S. defendant in a suit brought in Japanese courts; it would also guide a U.S. plaintiff seeking to sue a Spanish defendant in Spain. The Convention provides that each signatory nation must designate a “Central Authority”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11A67_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N11A67_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*3</a></span> responsible for serving process on its nationals.

<p id="c08210d5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our discussion of jurisdiction has thus far proceeded as if the only relevant questions are constitutional power and notice. Each case has silently assumed that the state or federal court in question was authorized to assert jurisdiction if doing so was constitutionally permissible. The issue has been whether the Constitution permitted such an assertion of jurisdiction. We now go behind that assumption in three settings: long-arm statutes, venue laws, and the doctrine of forum non conveniens. Each represents a situation in which the legislature or courts have framed rules that restrict where a lawsuit may take place—even when the Constitution would pose no obstacles.</p>

<p id="c08210d8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A court may exercise jurisdiction over a defendant only when the state or federal government authorizes it to do so (and the authorization must be constitutional as applied to the case in question). In the world of <i>Pennoyer</i> such authorization was usually a simple matter: Had the state provided for service of process on a defendant in this situation? As the doctrines of personal jurisdiction expanded (especially in the years after <i>International Shoe</i>), many states began to authorize service (sometimes by mail) on defendants beyond their borders. Because <i>Pennoyer</i> had conceived of such extensions of state court jurisdiction as near-physical exertions of state power, statutes authorizing courts to reach beyond their own borders came to be known as “long-arm” statutes: States were extending their jurisdictional “arms.” The name has stuck.</p>
<p id="c08210d9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some states have enacted long-arm statutes that reach for as much jurisdiction as the Constitution allows. California provides a well-known example:</p>

Ms. Gibbons was giving directions to Mr. Brown, who was driving. The car turned the wrong way onto a one-way street, resulting in a head-on collision that injured both passengers. In 1995, Ms. Gibbons, a Texas resident, sued Mr. Brown in Florida alleging his negligent driving caused the accident; Mrs. Brown was not a party. Two years later, Mrs. Brown, seeking to recover for her own injuries, brought this Florida action against Ms. Gibbons alleging that her faulty directions caused the crash.]</p>

First, the plaintiff must allege sufficient jurisdictional facts to bring the defendant within the coverage of the long-arm statute, section 48.193, Florida Statutes. If that prong is satisfied, then the second inquiry is whether sufficient “minimum contacts” are shown to comply with the requirements of due process. <i>International Shoe Co. v. Washington</i>. Generally speaking, Florida’s long-arm statutes are of a class that requires more activities or contacts to allow service of process than are currently required by the decisions of the United States Supreme Court.</p>
<p id="c08237f5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As to the first part of the inquiry, Mrs. Brown contends that the allegations in her complaint satisfy section 48.193(2), Florida Statutes (1995), which states:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c08237f6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A defendant who is engaged in substantial and not isolated activity within this state, whether such activity is wholly intrastate, interstate, or otherwise, is subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state, whether or not the claim arises from that activity.</p>
</div>
<p id="c08237f7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The parties agree that as a general rule in Florida, a plaintiff, by bringing an action, subjects herself to the jurisdiction of the court and to subsequent lawful orders entered regarding the same subject matter of that action. Mrs. Brown broadly construes this general rule to mean that by initiating the 1995 action, Ms. Gibbons subjected herself to Florida jurisdiction with respect to any “lawful orders” that were entered subsequently regarding “the subject matter of the action.” On the other hand, Ms. Gibbons notes that her prior suit was brought in 1995, whereas Mrs. Brown did <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="179" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page179">p. 179</span>not file her complaint until October 20, 1997. Although Ms. Gibbons acknowledges that her prior action arose from the same vehicular accident as Mrs. Brown’s instant suit, Ms. Gibbons notes that Mrs. Brown was not a party in the earlier action. Furthermore, several years separate the filing of the two proceedings. For purposes of the resolution of the question on appeal, we assume that the 1995 proceedings were over by the time Mrs. Brown brought her 1997 suit.</p>

Greenbaum, 585 So. 2d 1089 (Fla. 3d DCA 1991),. . . . [o]bserving that an entity cannot control where its account debtors choose to relocate, the court stated that “the filing of lawsuits unrelated to this action against account debtors in Florida does not subject Milberg to the jurisdiction of our courts.” Even if we assume (without deciding) that bringing an action in a Florida court can constitute a “substantial and not isolated activity” in some instances, we nevertheless note that Mrs. Brown has not shown that Ms. Gibbons “is engaged” in any activity in this state whatsoever other than defending the present suit. A current defendant’s prior decision to bring a suit in Florida should not act indefinitely as a sword of Damocles hanging perilously over the head of that defendant if she later challenges jurisdiction in a separate suit (albeit a suit arising from the same subject matter). . . . Given the length of time between the two actions and the fact that the prior suit named as the defendant a non-party in the instant proceedings, we conclude that Mrs. Brown has not alleged a satisfactory ground for personal jurisdiction pursuant to statutory subsection (2). The appellee does not suggest, nor do we find, that the appellant’s filing the 1995 action in the Florida court would, by itself, satisfy any of the alternative grounds for jurisdiction set forth in section 48.193(1)(a)-(1)(h). . . . </p>

When Adam sued in Texas to enforce his judgment, Saenger defended on the ground that the California court lacked personal jurisdiction.

Provisions of the federal securities laws provide one example. Another is the Federal Interpleader Act, 28 U.S.C. §2361, which gives federal courts the power to serve process anywhere in the nation, a power that has been interpreted to include personal jurisdiction.</p></li>

<p id="c0828635-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Like personal jurisdiction, <i>venue</i> determines where litigation will take place. Unlike personal jurisdiction, venue flows solely from statutory—not constitutional—sources. Also unlike personal jurisdiction, which is generally directed to which state a suit can be brought in, venue determines within which federal judicial district suit can be brought. (States are divided into federal judicial “districts,” with the count ranging from one in less populated states to four (in California, New York, and Texas).)</p>
<p id="c0828636-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The general federal venue statute is 28 U.S.C. §1391. Its goal is to place suits in judicial districts connected either to the parties or to the events giving rise to the <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="182" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page182">p. 182</span>action. See, for example, 28 U.S.C. §1391(b), which puts venue “where any defendant resides” if all defendants reside in the same state or where “a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred.” Because of this, the inquiries necessary under the venue statutes duplicate those involved in personal jurisdiction questions, but focus on contacts with a judicial district within a state, not with the state as a whole.</p>
<p id="c0828637-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why, then, have both a law of personal jurisdiction and one of venue? At a technical level the answer to that question is easy: Unlike personal jurisdiction, venue locates litigation not just in a state but in a particular federal judicial district within that state. For example, suppose a defendant is clearly subject to personal jurisdiction in Florida, which has three federal judicial districts. See 28 U.S.C. §133(a). Principles of personal jurisdiction tell plaintiff that she can sue in Florida, but the venue statutes and cases interpreting them will tell her in which of the three districts venue will lie, and thus whether she needs to file the complaint at a courthouse in Tallahassee, Tampa, or Miami.</p>
<p id="c0828638-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The federal venue statute took its present form in 2011, following a century-long evolution during which it was occasionally impossible to find a judicial district in which venue lay even when there was both personal and subject matter jurisdiction over the case and parties.</p>
<p id="c0828639-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statute’s structure is straightforward. Subsection (a) makes it clear that §1391 provides the venue provisions for all civil actions in federal courts—unless a specific statute provides otherwise. (For an example of a special venue provision, see 28 U.S.C. §1397, which provides that in an interpleader action—covered in Chapter 12—venue lies in any district where any claimant resides.)</p>
<p id="c082863a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subsection (b) then provides three potential alternative venues. The first two are primary and the third (in (b)(3)) comes into play only if the first two do not yield an appropriate venue.</p>
<p id="c082863b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subsections (c) and (d) clarify an issue that had proved vexing under previous versions of the statute: Given that “residency” often establishes venue, how does one define that term?</p>
<p id="c082863c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For this analysis, entities are treated differently than natural persons. The statute has separate definitions for persons and for entities (corporations, limited liability companies, and the like). Though the statute does not say so, for venue purposes the principal place of business of an entity will likely be defined the same way under the venue statute as it is for diversity jurisdiction—as the “nerve center” of the entity. <i>Hertz Corp. v. Friend</i>, infra page 225. If a state has more than one district? See §1391(d).</p>
<p id="c082863d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statute also addresses the issue of residency for citizens of other countries. The statute makes clear that non-citizens who have been admitted by the United States as permanent residents are to be treated as citizens for venue purposes under subsection (c)(1). Courts are split about whether <i>all</i> non-citizens, regardless of whether they are lawful permanent residents, reside in the judicial district in which they are domiciled for venue purposes under subsection (c)(1). For a case concluding they do, see Alvardo v. United States, 2017 WL 2303758 (D.N.J. May 25, 2017).</p>

<p id="c082d474-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to the complaint. . . . on March 14, 2011, the plaintiff purchased from Greyhound in Pensacola a one-way ticket to Tunica, Mississippi, to arrive at 5:05 <span class="epub-small-caps">p.m</span>. on March 15. A Greyhound bus delivered the plaintiff from Pensacola to Mobile just after midnight on March 15. Seven hours later, Greyhound personnel directed the plaintiff to board a Colonial Trailways bus. The driver, defendant Terry Reeves, announced that the bus was traveling only to Jackson, Mississippi and would thereafter return to Mobile. Reeves also announced that his bus was scheduled to arrive in Jackson at 12:05 <span class="epub-small-caps">p.m</span>. and that a bus would depart Jackson at 12:30 <span class="epub-small-caps">p.m</span>., arriving in Tunica at 5:05 <span class="epub-small-caps">p.m</span>. The plaintiff, upon hearing this, decided it was time for a nap.</p>
<p id="c082d475-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So far, so good. But when the plaintiff awakened, he realized it was almost 2:30 <span class="epub-small-caps">p.m</span>. and that the bus was now headed back to Mobile. He and Reeves exchanged words, but the bus continued to Mobile, where the plaintiff remained for over nine hours before his brother sent him a pre-paid ticket back to Pensacola. Because of these events, the plaintiff “missed his court-date and was found guilty in absentia.” The plaintiff sues Greyhound, Colonial Trailways and Reeves on several state law causes of action. Subject matter jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship.</p>

<p id="c082d477-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Greyhound argues that the action should be dismissed for improper venue or, in the alternative, for failure to state a claim. It is well established that a court should address challenges to subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) and challenges to personal jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(2) before considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion based on failure to state a claim. . . . For similar reasons, the Court concludes that it should resolve Greyhound’s challenge to venue under Rule 12(b)(3) before addressing its Rule 12(b)(6) motion. See Arrowsmith v. United Press International, 320 F.2d 219, 221 (2d Cir. 1963) (venue should be resolved before addressing failure to state a claim).</p>
<p id="c082fb88-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although unnoted by the parties, “[t]he plaintiff has the burden of showing that venue in the forum is proper.”. . . . However, “[w]hen a complaint is dismissed on the basis of improper venue without an evidentiary hearing, ’the plaintiff must present only a prima facie showing of venue.’”. . . . “Further, ’[t]he facts as alleged in the complaint are taken as true to the extent they are uncontroverted by defendants’ affidavits.’”. . . . Greyhound did not request an evidentiary hearing, so the plaintiff need present only a prima facie showing of venue. Neither side presented affidavits or other evidence, so the Court’s review is limited to the complaint. As discussed below, that document does not suffice to meet the plaintiff’s burden of making a prima facie showing of proper venue.</p>
<p id="c082fb89-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="185" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page185">p. 185</span>The propriety of venue in this case is to be measured by 28 U.S.C. §1391(b). This statute provides two means of establishing proper venue, with a third means available if proper venue cannot be established under either of the first two.</p>
<p id="c082fb8a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Venue is proper in “a judicial district in which any defendant resides, if all defendants are residents of the State in which the district is located.” 28 U.S.C. §1391(b)(1). For purposes of this provision, an individual resides “in the United States district in which that person is domiciled.” §1391(c)(1). According to the complaint, Reeves “is a citizen of Florida with his domicile residence in the State of Florida.”. . . . Because Reeves does not reside in Alabama, venue is not proper under Section 1391(b)(1).</p>
<p id="c082fb8b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Venue is also proper in “a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred.” 28 U.S.C. §1391(b)(2). Under this provision, “[o]nly the events that directly give rise to a claim are relevant.”. . . . The only event that occurred in this District was that the plaintiff changed buses here, and that event did not “directly give rise to a claim.” The plaintiff does not allege that the transfer constituted a breach of contract, only that Greyhound had not told him, when he purchased the ticket to Tunica the previous day, that he would be transferring to a Colonial Trailways bus. Greyhound’s alleged negligence and breach of contract, according to the complaint, derive from its failure to safely and successfully transport the plaintiff to Tunica, and nothing that occurred in Alabama caused or contributed to such failure. According to the complaint, Greyhound contracted to get him to Tunica at 5:05 <span class="epub-small-caps">p.m</span>. on March 15, and taking the Colonial Trailways bus to Jackson would have (but for his sleeping through the transfer) gotten him to Tunica at precisely that time. The mere fact that the plaintiff passed through this District and changed buses here is not a “part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim,” much less a “substantial” part. Accordingly, venue is not proper under Section 1391(b)(2).</p>
<p id="c082fb8c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the plaintiff’s claims certainly occurred in the Southern District of Mississippi. Greyhound explicitly concedes the propriety of venue in that District. . . . Because proper venue can be established under Section 1391(b)(2) (only not in this District), the plaintiff cannot rely on Section 1391(b)(3) to establish venue.</p>
<p id="c082fb8d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“The district court of a district in which is filed a case laying venue in the wrong division or district shall dismiss, or if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought.” 28 U.S.C. §1406(a). To the extent the phrase “in which it could have been brought” requires that personal jurisdiction over the defendants exist in the transferee district, specific personal jurisdiction exists in the Southern District of Mississippi, as the plaintiff’s claims arise from and relate to the defendants’ contacts with that District—Reeves’ driving of the plaintiff there (and not waking him up in Jackson), Colonial Trailways’ operation of the bus there, and Greyhound’s sale of a ticket to transport the plaintiff through there. The parties make no argument to the contrary.</p>
<p id="c082fb8e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Greyhound requests the Court to dismiss rather than transfer, but it offers no explanation why this route should be preferred. As this Court has noted, “[g]enerally, the interests of justice [favor] transferring a case to the appropriate judicial district rather than dismissing it.” Boutwell v. Advance Construction Services, Inc., 2007 WL 2988238 at 3 (S.D. Ala. 2007) (internal quotes omitted).

<p id="c08322ae-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When an action is brought in state court, federal venue statutes are irrelevant; they only apply to actions originally brought in the federal courts. (Cases removed to the federal courts from state courts are similarly not subject to federal venue requirements; venue lies in the district encompassing the state court from which the case is removed.) States, however, have their own venue statutes that indicate in which county an action must be brought. Professors James, Hazard, and Leubsdorf have summarized the state venue rules as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c08322af-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In other actions, state venue rules—in contrast to federal venue rules—follow variegated patterns that employ one or more of the following tests: (a) where the cause of action, or part of it, arose or accrued; (b) where some fact is present or happened; (c) where the defendant resides; (d) where the defendant is doing business; (e) where the defendant has an office or place of business, an agent, or representative, or where an agent or officer of defendant resides; (f) where the plaintiff resides; (g) where the plaintiff is doing business; (h) where the defendant may be found; (i) where the defendant may be summoned or served; (j) in the county designated in the plaintiff’s complaint; (k) in any county; (l) where the seat of government is located. The tests that give plaintiff the widest choice are often applicable only when defendant is a nonresident of the state. The defendant’s residence is the most common provision for venue.</p>
</div>
<p id="c08322b0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">James, Hazard &amp; Leubsdorf 146, citing George Neff Stevens, <i>Venue Statutes: Diagnosis and Proposed Cure</i>, 49 Mich. L. Rev. 307, 315 (1951).</p>
<p id="c08322b1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another principle that is sometimes given the label “venue” is the local-action rule for certain causes of action, chiefly those involving real property. The rule states that only the courts of the state where land is located will hear cases that raise any question concerning title to the land. In the early case of Livingston v. Jefferson, 15 F. Cas. 660 (C.C.D. Va. 1811) (No. 8,411), Livingston sought to sue Thomas Jefferson for trespass to land located in Louisiana. As Jefferson was a resident of Virginia and not subject to jurisdiction elsewhere, and as the court ruled that under English common law the action was local and had to be brought where the land was located, the plaintiff was effectively left without a remedy. The rule has since been changed by statute in many states and was rejected by court decision in Reasor-Hill Corp. v. Harrison, 220 Ark. 521, 249 S.W.2d 994 (1952). Another traditional local action is an action by a state to collect taxes, although increasingly that restriction has been abandoned. E.g., Oklahoma ex rel. Oklahoma Tax Committee v. Neely, 225 Ark. 230, 282 S.W.2d 150 (1955).</p>

You have already encountered one example of this power: long-arm statutes that do not extend as far as the Constitution would permit. As personal <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="188" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page188">p. 188</span>jurisdiction has expanded under modern cases, courts have more frequently exercised the power of declining to hear cases. Both statutes and common law decisions express this power to decline jurisdiction. This section examines two of the rationales for declining to exercise jurisdiction. One—the common law doctrine of forum non conveniens<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11D67_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N11D67_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*4</a></span>—affects both state and federal courts. The other—transfer among federal judicial districts under 28 U.S.C. §1404—applies only to the federal courts, allowing them to move cases around the country “for the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interests of justice.”</p>
<p id="c08322b6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both §1404(a) transfer and forum non conveniens dismissals flow from the same perception: that there will be circumstances in which a court has the power to hear a case but, for reasons of justice or efficiency, should not do so. For example, the judge may conclude that although jurisdiction is clear, the preponderance of witnesses, perhaps some of them severely disabled, will have to travel long distances to testify. Under these or similar circumstances, a federal court may decide to either transfer the case to another federal court under §1404(a) or dismiss it under the forum non conveniens doctrine for trial in another country. A state court might take a similar action, transferring (under a state statute analogous to §1404(a)) to another court in the same state or dismissing under the forum non conveniens doctrine for refiling in another state or country. We start with the more basic doctrine, forum non conveniens.</p>

Reyno is not related to and does not know any of the decedents or their survivors; she was a legal secretary to the attorney who filed this lawsuit. Several days after her appointment, Reyno commenced separate wrongful-death actions against Piper and Hartzell in the Superior Court of California, claiming negligence and strict liability. . . . Reyno candidly admits that the action against Piper and Hartzell was filed in the United States because its laws regarding liability, capacity to sue, and damages are more favorable to her position than are those of Scotland. Scottish law does not recognize strict liability in tort. Moreover, it permits wrongful-death actions only when brought by a decedent’s relatives. The relatives may sue only for “loss of support and society.”</p>

Thus, if the possibility of an unfavorable change in substantive law is given substantial weight in the forum non conveniens inquiry, dismissal would rarely be proper. . . . </p>

At least where the foreign plaintiff named an American manufacturer as defendant, a court could not dismiss the case on grounds of forum non conveniens where dismissal might lead to an unfavorable change in law. The American courts, which are already extremely attractive to foreign plaintiffs, would become even more attractive.

In these cases, however, the remedies that would be provided by the Scottish courts do not fall within this category.

When the home forum has been chosen, it is reasonable to assume that this choice is convenient. When the plaintiff is foreign, however, this assumption is much less reasonable.

Particularly with respect to the question of relative ease of access to sources of proof, the private interests point in both directions. As respondent emphasizes, records concerning the design, manufacture, and testing of the propeller and plane are located in the United States.

On the basis of its choice-of-law analysis, it concluded that if the case were tried in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania law would apply to Piper and Scottish law to Hartzell. It stated that a trial involving two sets of laws would be confusing to the jury. It also noted its own lack of familiarity with Scottish law.

All of the decedents were Scottish. Apart from Piper and Hartzell, all potential plaintiffs and defendants are either Scottish or English. As we stated in <i>Gilbert</i>, there is “a local interest in having localized controversies decided at home.” Respondent argues that American citizens have an interest in ensuring that American manufacturers are deterred from producing defective products, and that additional deterrence might be obtained if Piper and Hartzell were tried in the United States, where they could be sued on the basis of both negligence and strict liability. However, the incremental deterrence that would be gained if this trial were held in American court is likely to be insignificant. The American interest in this accident is simply not sufficient to justify the enormous commitment of judicial time and resources that would inevitably be required if the case were to be tried here.</p>

Plaintiffs were U.S. citizens, survivors and heirs of the victims of shootings in an Egyptian hotel operated by defendant, where a gunman, apparently motivated by political and religious animus, had shot six people. Plaintiffs brought a federal diversity action in New York against the New York-based corporate hotel operator. The district court dismissed on forum non conveniens grounds, finding that an Egyptian court would be more familiar with Egyptian law, which governed the action, that Egypt’s commitment to tourism assured that the suit would be handled properly, and that there was already related litigation pending in Egypt—suits brought by the families of French and Italian victims. The Second Circuit reversed, holding that the district court had abused its discretion in dismissing. The inconvenience and “emotional burden” on plaintiffs outweighed the “slight[ly]” greater convenience of litigation in Egypt, said the court. Can you distinguish <i>Piper</i>?</p></li>

Atlantic Marine then entered into a subcontract with respondent J-Crew Management, Inc., a Texas corporation, for work on the project. This subcontract included a forum-selection clause, which stated that all disputes between the parties “’shall be litigated in the Circuit Court for the City of Norfolk, Virginia, or the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Norfolk Division.’”  . . . </p>
<p id="c0845a84-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a dispute about payment under the subcontract arose, however, J-Crew sued Atlantic Marine in the Western District of Texas, invoking that court’s diversity jurisdiction.

<p id="c0848199-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Atlantic Marine contends that a party may enforce a forum-selection clause by seeking dismissal of the suit under §1406(a) and Rule 12(b)(3). We disagree. Section 1406(a) and Rule 12(b)(3) allow dismissal only when venue is “wrong” or “improper.” Whether venue is “wrong” or “improper” depends exclusively on whether the court in which the case was brought satisfies the requirements of federal venue laws, and those provisions say nothing about a forum-selection clause.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c084819a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">A</p></div>
<p id="c084819b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 1406(a) provides that “[t]he district court of a district in which is filed a case laying venue in the wrong division or district shall dismiss, or if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought.” Rule 12(b)(3) states that a party may move to dismiss a case for “improper venue.” These provisions therefore authorize dismissal only when venue is “wrong” or “improper” in the forum in which it was brought.</p>
<p id="c084819c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This question—whether venue is “wrong” or “improper"—is generally governed by 28 U.S.C. §1391.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11FC6_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N11FC6_d5438a66-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">2</a></span> That provision states that “[e]xcept as otherwise provided by <i>law</i>. . . . this section <i>shall</i> govern the venue of <i>all civil actions</i> brought in district courts of the United States.” §1391(a)(1) (emphasis added). . . . Whether the parties entered into a contract containing a forum-selection clause has no bearing on whether a case falls into one of the categories of cases listed in §1391(b). As a result, a case filed in a district that falls within §1391 may not be dismissed under §1406(a) or Rule 12(b)(3).</p>
<p id="c084819e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="197" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page197">p. 197</span>Petitioner’s contrary view improperly conflates the special statutory term “venue” and the word “forum.” It is certainly true that, in some contexts, the word “venue” is used synonymously with the term “forum,” but §1391 makes clear that venue in “all civil actions” must be determined in accordance with the criteria outlined in that section. That language cannot reasonably be read to allow judicial consideration of other, extrastatutory limitations on the forum in which a case may be brought.</p>
<p id="c084819f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The structure of the federal venue provisions confirms that they alone define whether venue exists in a given forum. In particular, the venue statutes reflect Congress’ intent that venue should always lie in <i>some</i> federal court whenever federal courts have personal jurisdiction over the defendant. . . . As we have previously noted, “Congress does not in general intend to create venue gaps, which take away with one hand what Congress has given by way of jurisdictional grant with the other.”  . . . </p>

<p id="c08481a1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although a forum-selection clause does not render venue in a court “wrong” or “improper” within the meaning of §1406(a) or Rule 12(b)(3), the clause may be enforced through a motion to transfer under §1404(a). That provision states that “[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought or to any district or division to which all parties have consented.” Unlike §1406(a), §1404(a) does not condition transfer on the initial forum’s being “wrong.” And it permits transfer to any district where venue is also proper (i.e., “where [the case] might have been brought”) or to any other district to which the parties have agreed by contract or stipulation.</p>
<p id="c08481a2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 1404(a) therefore provides a mechanism for enforcement of forum-selection clauses that point to a particular federal district. And for the reasons we address in Part III, a proper application of §1404(a) requires that a forum-selection clause be “given controlling weight in all but the most exceptional cases<i>.</i>” <i>Stewart</i>. . . . (Kennedy, J., concurring).</p>
<p id="c08481a3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Atlantic Marine argues that §1404(a) is not a suitable mechanism to enforce forum-selection clauses because that provision cannot provide for transfer when a forum-selection clause specifies a state or foreign tribunal,. . . . and we agree with Atlantic Marine that the Court of Appeals failed to provide a sound answer to this problem. The Court of Appeals opined that a forum-selection clause pointing to a nonfederal forum should be enforced through Rule 12(b)(3), which permits a party to move for dismissal of a case based on “improper venue.” As Atlantic Marine persuasively argues, however, that conclusion cannot be reconciled with our construction of the term “improper venue” in §1406 to refer only to a forum that does not satisfy federal venue laws. If venue is proper under federal venue rules, it does not matter for the purpose of Rule 12(b)(3) whether the forum-selection clause points to a federal or a nonfederal forum.</p>
<p id="c08481a4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Instead, the appropriate way to enforce a forum-selection clause pointing to a state or foreign forum is through the doctrine of <i>forum non conveniens</i>. Section 1404(a) is merely a codification of the doctrine of <i>forum non conveniens</i> for the subset of cases in which the transferee forum is within the federal court system; in such cases, Congress has replaced the traditional remedy of outright dismissal with transfer. . . . For the <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="198" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page198">p. 198</span>remaining set of cases calling for a nonfederal forum, §1404(a) has no application, but the residual doctrine of <i>forum non conveniens</i> “has continuing application in federal courts.” Sinochem [Intl. Co. v. Malaysia Intl. Shipping, 549 U.S. at 430 (2007)] (noting that federal courts invoke <i>forum non conveniens</i> “in cases where the alternative forum is abroad, and perhaps in rare instances where a state or territorial court serves litigational convenience best”). . . . And because both §1404(a) and the <i>forum non conveniens</i> doctrine from which it derives entail the same balancing-of-interests standard, courts should evaluate a forum-selection clause pointing to a nonfederal forum in the same way that they evaluate a forum-selection clause pointing to a federal forum. . . . </p>

A forum-selection clause, after all, may have figured centrally in the parties’ negotiations and may have affected how they set monetary and other contractual terms; it may, in fact, have been a critical factor in their agreement to do business together in the first place. In all but the most unusual cases, therefore, “the interest of justice” is served by holding parties to their bargain. . . . </p>

<p id="c084cfda-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This chapter has explored the elaborate law developed to answer a single question: In which court(s) can this lawsuit against this defendant be brought? The complexity of the doctrine answering that question testifies both to its practical importance and to a constitutional structure that recognizes a degree of independent autonomy and sovereignty in the several states. Simply put: It matters whether Alabama or California courts will hear a case because constitutional structure gives the governments of Alabama and California, including their respective courts, the last word on many important questions. Under our federal structure, however, there is an overarching—but limited—federal sovereignty with its own court system. So, in each case, the question is not simply whether the case belongs in State <i>A</i> or State <i>B</i>, but whether the case can be heard in a federal court instead of a state court. The next chapter explores the answer to that question.</p>

C is correct because, in the absence of any contacts with California, jurisdiction would not lie against an out-of-state defendant. A is wrong because of Rule 12(b)(2). D is wrong because, unlike federal subject matter jurisdiction, which can be raised on the court’s own motion, personal jurisdiction is waived unless raised by the defendant.</p>
<p id="c0856c4a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q2.</b> A, B, and C are correct responses. A is correct because, unlike <i>Atlantic Marine Construction</i>, no district in California has venue according to 28 U.S.C. §1391 and venue is therefore improper. B is correct because, again in contrast to <i>Atlantic Marine Construction,</i> venue is improper in any district in California, and <i>Thompson v. Greyhound Lines</i> teaches us that, when venue does not lie, one of the options is to move under §1406 for transfer to a district where venue is proper. C is correct because <i>Atlantic Marine Construction</i> leaves this issue open: If venue is <i>improper,</i> does a motion to transfer under a forum selection clause lie—or is that motion appropriate only when, disregarding the forum selection clause, venue would be proper? D is wrong because a 12(b)(6) motion goes to the validity of the complaint, not the appropriate location of the court.</p>
<p id="c0856c4b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q3.</b> C is the only correct response. C is correct because, by failing to raise the question of personal jurisdiction either in a pre-answer motion or in its answer, GrowCo has waived the defense. Rule 12(h)(1). A is wrong because, even if its contentions about contacts are correct, GrowCo has waived. B is doubly wrong: both because personal jurisdiction <i>is</i> often about facts and because defendant has waived the defense.</p>
<p id="c0856c4c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q4.</b> B is the only accurate response. The federal courts, and most state systems, allow one to challenge jurisdiction, litigate on the merits, and then to argue on appeal that both the refusal to grant a jurisdictional dismissal as well as other errors on the merits warrant reversal.</p>

A is correct because some of <i>Mullane</i>’s power came from its ruling against a litigant relying on “seizure” plus published notice. B is correct because the opinion is full of this kind of language. C is correct because that was <i>Mullane</i>’s answer to the problem of unnotified beneficiaries: They would be bound because adequately represented by someone with the same interests.

<p id="c0856c4e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q6.</b> B and D are the correct responses. A is wrong because Rule 4(d)(1) makes it explicit that waiver of service is not a waiver of jurisdictional objections. C is wrong because failure or refusal to waive creates liability for costs of service, but has no further consequence. B is correct because the extension of time to answer is one of the carrots contained in Rule 4(d)(3). D is correct because 4(d)(2) provides for the imposition of costs “unless good cause [for failure to waive] be shown.”</p>
<p id="c0856c4f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q7.</b> D is the correct response. A is wrong because even the cases that list interactivity as an element in jurisdictional analysis make use of a sliding scale in which the amount of interactivity is relevant. B is wrong because the relevant question will be whether Sam purposefully availed himself of the North Carolina market; while making a product especially suitable for North Carolina would be one way of demonstrating that availment, there are many others—such as shipping his product to a North Carolina buyer—that indicate purposeful availment. C is wrong because, given the substance of the lawsuit, it will be Sam’s product, not Sam’s personal travels that will be relevant. D is correct because the ability to know that one is doing business with a North Carolina customer is highly relevant to the question of purposeful availment.</p>
<p id="c0859360-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q8.</b> C is the correct response. A is wrong because Purchaser can demonstrate specific jurisdiction if the facts warrant it. B is wrong because federal courts need both subject matter jurisdiction (here based on diversity) <i>and</i> personal jurisdiction. C is correct because under the stream-of-commerce cases as well as <i>Hanson v. Denkla</i> the relevant question will be the extent to which Maker sought to avail itself of business opportunities in Washington. D is wrong because both <i>Nicastro</i> and <i>Daimler</i> say that the relevant question is the extent to which Maker tried to sell its cars in Washington, not the precise corporate structure involved; see, e.g., footnote 7 in <i>Daimler.</i></p>
<p id="c0859361-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q9.</b> C is probably the correct response. <i>Bristol-Myers Squibb v. Superior Court</i> held that California lacked jurisdiction over the out-of-state plaintiffs under similar circumstances. A is wrong because, for states in which general jurisdiction does not lie, the cases require a connection between defendant’s actions and this claim against this plaintiff—not just a general effort to do business in the state. B is wrong: <i>Daimler AG v. Bauman</i> held that even a high volume of business was not enough to support jurisdiction over claims unrelated to that business.</p>

<p id="c0928bb4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Personal jurisdiction doctrine limits both state and federal courts in relation to particular defendants. If the defendant lacks connection with the forum state, due process forbids courts sitting in that state from rendering a judgment that will bind that defendant.</p>
<p id="c0928bb5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts and lawyers in the United States must also cope with a second jurisdictional boundary—this one between the powers of state and federal courts. The Constitution created a federal government but made the federal government supreme only in certain areas. In other areas the states are sovereign, and in still others federal and state governments share power.</p>
<p id="c0928bb6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The centuries since the ratification of the Constitution have seen numerous political struggles and a bloody civil war fought over the location of the line between state and federal powers. That continuing struggle is reflected in the realm of civil procedure. State and federal governments both have court systems. But because of limits on federal power, federal courts can hear only certain kinds of cases. Consequently, litigants, their lawyers, and federal judges need to know whether a particular kind of case must be filed in federal court. Other kinds of cases can only be filed in state court. And in many others, both state <i>and</i> federal courts are available. Lawyers describe this sorting of cases between court systems as “subject matter jurisdiction.”</p><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="206" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page206">p. 206</span>

<li><p id="c092d9e5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Chapter 2, we assumed that the court in question could hear the <i>kind of case</i> at issue—Neff’s trespass action against Pennoyer, the Robinsons’ tort claim against World-Wide and Audi, Ms. Abdouch’s right-of-privacy claim against Mr. Lopez, and so on. The only question was whether the court had the power to enter a judgment against a particular <i>defendant</i>—given the defendant’s connection with the state.</p></li>
<li><p id="c092d9e6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this chapter we will flip those assumptions, taking for granted that the court has personal jurisdiction over the defendant.

<li><p id="c092d9e7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To have the requisite authority, a federal district court must have <i>both</i> personal jurisdiction over the defendant <i>and</i> subject matter jurisdiction over the kind of case.

<p id="c092d9e9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A sketch of constitutional history reveals several political compromises that shape the structure of federal judicial jurisdiction. Read Article III, the portion of the Constitution devoted to the judiciary. You won’t be surprised to see that §1 of this Article establishes a Supreme Court. But you may be surprised to learn that the Constitution views other federal courts as optional. Section 1 authorizes, but does not require, Congress to establish lower federal courts—what we know <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="207" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page207">p. 207</span>today as the courts of appeals and the district courts. Putting the question of lower federal courts into Congress’s hands represented a compromise between those who feared an overly powerful federal government and those who viewed the establishment of federal courts as one of the most important goals of the new government. The compromise left the issue subject to changeable legislative wishes. In fact, the first Congress created lower federal courts, and their existence has never been in serious doubt since, though the exact scope of their powers has often been questioned.</p>
<p id="c092d9ea-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 2 of Article III contains a second compromise, one whose terms have been fiercely contested for more than 200 years. Article III, §2 limits federal courts’ jurisdiction to the list set forth in §2. By implication a case not listed in Article III, §2 may not be heard in a federal court. Such a case could be heard only in a state court. Within the boundaries of Article III, however, Congress remains free to bestow all or some of the constitutionally permissible jurisdiction on the lower federal courts.</p>
<p id="c092d9eb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This history has implications even in ordinary lawsuits. Because the federal courts are courts of <i>limited jurisdiction</i>, two questions lurk at the threshold of every case brought in a federal court: Does the case fall within one of the enumerated categories of Article III, §2; and has Congress further authorized the lower federal courts to assume that jurisdiction?</p>
<p id="c092d9ec-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 8(a)(1) reflects these concerns by requiring every federal complaint to begin with a “short and plain statement of the grounds for the court’s jurisdiction.” In judging those jurisdictional statements, the courts look to three bodies of law—the Constitution, the statutes conferring jurisdiction, and the case law interpreting both.</p>
<p id="c09300fd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Skimming the jurisdictional statutes, one might not suspect another important feature: Federal courts share much of their jurisdiction with state courts.</p>

It grants federal courts jurisdiction over cases that arise under federal law. That federal courts have such jurisdiction does not seem surprising, but it may be surprising to learn that they do not have exclusive jurisdiction over such cases. So far as Congress and the Constitution are concerned, cases arising under federal law can be brought in state as well as federal courts. Lawyers describe such shared jurisdiction as <i>concurrent</i>. Like general federal question cases, diversity jurisdiction (28 U.S.C. §1332) is also concurrent. In some instances Congress has made federal jurisdiction exclusive. (28 U.S.C. §§1333 (admiralty), 1334 (bankruptcy), and 1346(b) (tort suits based on negligence of a federal employee).) For an example of a statute carefully discriminating between grants of concurrent and exclusive federal jurisdiction, read 28 U.S.C. §1338. In still other instances Congress has specifically forbidden federal courts from hearing cases that might otherwise fall within their jurisdiction; for example, 28 U.S.C. §1341 forbids federal courts from enjoining state tax collection in most circumstances.</p>
<p id="c0932817-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why would a lawyer or a litigant care whether a state or federal court heard her case? Assuming some court is available, why should it matter which one? The answer has both practical and political dimensions. As a tactical matter, the reasons for seeking a federal rather than a state court range from the practical (some federal courts presently have shorter waiting times until trial than their state counterparts) to the strategic (is the defendant likely to get a more sympathetic hearing from the local state judge than from the federal judge in a city at the other end of the state; will a six-person federal jury, drawn from a broader geographic area and required to reach a unanimous verdict, be likely to award higher—or lower—damages than the state jury, which may have 12 members and may be allowed to reach a non-unanimous majority verdict; is the federal bench generally more liberal or conservative than the state court bench in the particular jurisdiction?) to the crafty (is the opposing lawyer uncomfortable with the generally more formal conduct and faster pace of federal litigation?).</p>
<p id="c0932818-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On a different plane, note that Article III, §1 gives federal judges lifetime tenure, a protection that shields them from political pressure. So a litigant with a legally strong but unpopular claim or defense might prefer federal court. The limited jurisdiction of the federal courts also shields them, however, from certain kinds of cases: Family law disputes, for example, are not part of the federal docket. These dual insulations—from political pressure and from a broad caseload—may work in opposite directions. Arguing that federal courts possess a range of virtues ranging from greater competence to “class-based predilections favorable to constitutional enforcement,” a civil rights litigator once argued that in virtually every conceivable situation the federal courts would be more hospitable to his clients’ claims. Bert Neuborne, <i>The Myth of Parity</i>, 90 Harv. L. Rev. 1105 (1977). More recently, another similar litigator argued that for his gay and lesbian clients, the state courts’ closer ties both to the local community and their broad mix of cases made them the superior forum. William Rubenstein, <i>The Myth of Superiority</i>, 16 Const. Comment. 599 (2000). So even experienced lawyers believe it matters whether a state or a federal court hears the case—even in instances when the two courts would be applying the same substantive law. This proposition sets the stage for an exploration of federal subject matter jurisdiction.</p>

<p id="c0934f3a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today, most would intuitively assume that federal trial courts have jurisdiction to hear all cases involving federal law. In fact, that assumption has not been true for much of the nation’s history and is true today only in a limited form. Why? To answer that question, we must look again at constitutional history.</p>
<p id="c0934f3b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1789, Congress exercised its authority under Article III to create what the Constitution calls “inferior” federal courts. But Congress has only bestowed upon those courts some of the jurisdiction allowed under Article III. Among the most important early grants of jurisdiction were diversity and admiralty. Combined, these two jurisdictional grants gave federal courts jurisdiction over most significant interstate and international trade.</p>
<p id="c0934f3c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most striking from a modern perspective was the absence of any general federal question jurisdiction. There were individual statutes allowing suits invoking patent and federal pension laws, but federal courts had no general power to entertain claims based on federal law. That may not have mattered much in an age when there weren’t enough federal statutes to create a lot of such claims.</p>
<p id="c093764d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After the Civil War had reshaped understandings of federalism and, in particular, the federal courts’ role in the enforcement of civil rights, Congress in 1875 enacted a general federal question statute.</p>
<p id="c093764e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today, three kinds of cases dominate the federal district court civil docket— federal question cases are almost half, diversity cases a bit more than a third, and cases that land in federal court because the United States is a party, 15 percent.</p>

<p id="c0937650-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The difficulty comes in deciding what it means for a case to “arise under” federal law.

Consider what issues will be contested.</p></li>

Newspaper concedes the inaccuracy of its article but nevertheless believes that it has such a First Amendment defense. Consider what the contested issues in the second case will be.</p></li>

To settle their claims, the railroad in 1871 gave them a lifetime pass good for free transportation on the line. Several decades later, Congress, believing that railroads were using free transportation to bribe public officials, made free passes unlawful. The railroad thereupon refused to honor the Mottleys’ passes, citing the new federal legislation. The Mottleys sued in federal court seeking specific performance of their settlement. “The bill[, that is, the complaint,] further alleges: First, that the act of Congress referred to does not prohibit the giving of passes under the circumstances of this case; and, second, that if the law is to be construed as prohibiting such passes, it is in conflict with the Fifth Amendment of the constitution, because it deprives the plaintiffs of their property without due process of law. The defendant demurred to the bill.” The federal trial court overruled the demurrer and granted the Mottleys the relief they had requested. Defendant railroad appealed to the Supreme Court.]</p>

They are, first, whether that part of the act of Congress of June 29, 1906 (34 Stat. 584), which forbids the giving of free passes or the collection of any different compensation for transportation of passengers than that specified in the tariff filed, makes it unlawful to perform a contract for transportation of persons, who in good faith, before the passage of the act, had accepted such contract in satisfaction of a valid cause of action against the railroad; and, second, whether the statute, if it should be construed to render such a contract unlawful, is in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. We do not deem it necessary, however, to consider either of these questions, because, in our opinion, the court below was without jurisdiction of the cause. Neither party has questioned that jurisdiction, but it is the duty of this court to see to it that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, which is defined and limited by statute, is not exceeded. This duty we have frequently performed of our own motion.</p>
<p id="c0939d6b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There was no diversity of citizenship and it is not and cannot be suggested that there was any ground of jurisdiction, except that the case was a “suit. . . . arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States.” [The Court cited the then-current version of the “arising under” jurisdiction statute.] It is the settled interpretation of these words, as used in this statute, conferring jurisdiction, that a suit arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States only when the plaintiff’s statement of his own cause of action shows that it is based upon those laws or that Constitution. It is not enough that the plaintiff alleges some anticipated defense to his cause of action and asserts that the defense is invalidated by some provision of the Constitution of the United States. Although such allegations show that very likely, in the course of the litigation, a question under the Constitution would arise, they do not show that the suit, that is, the plaintiff’s original cause of action, arises under the Constitution. In Tennessee v. Union &amp; Planters’ Bank, 152 U.S. 454, the plaintiff, the State of Tennessee, brought suit in the Circuit Court of the United States to recover from the defendant certain taxes alleged to be due under the laws of the State. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant claimed an immunity from the taxation by virtue of its charter, and that therefore the tax was void, because in violation of the provision of the Constitution of the United States, which forbids any State from passing a law impairing the obligation of contracts. The cause was held to be beyond the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, the court saying, by Mr. Justice Gray, “a suggestion of one party, that the other will or may set up a claim under the Constitution or laws of the United States, does not make the suit one arising under that Constitution or those laws.” Again, in Boston &amp; Montana Consolidated Copper &amp; Silver Mining Company v. Montana Ore Purchasing Company, 188 U.S. 632, the. . . . cause was held to be beyond the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, the court saying, by Mr. Justice Peckham:</p>

<p id="c093c490-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Mottley</i> exemplifies the “well-pleaded complaint” rule, one rather rigid but widely used approach to a difficult problem. Can one justify this approach? An enormous number of claims have some federal ingredient in their background. For example, as Charles Wright pointed out, land title in most western states can be traced back to U.S. land grants. Wright, Federal Courts 104. Large numbers of checks and online payments clear through Federal Reserve banks. Does every question of land title or every suit on a bad check arise under federal law and thus belong in federal court? If one answers that question “no,” then one has to find a principled way of sorting claims in which federal questions have some central importance from those in which they are merely background assumptions.</p>
<p id="c093c491-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Mottley</i> chooses to sort roughly, based on the pleadings: The federal claim must appear as part of a well-pleaded complaint. That approach has at least one important advantage: It permits the sorting to occur at the start of the lawsuit before the parties and court have invested much time. To see the force of this point, consider the opposite extreme: One could, theoretically, postpone a decision on jurisdiction until after trial, to see whether an important question of federal law had emerged, and dismiss if it had not, allowing the case to start all over in state court. Not too surprisingly, not even the fiercest critic of <i>Mottley</i> has suggested taking things this far. Yet the <i>Mottley</i> approach eliminates cases from federal court, like <i>Mottley</i> itself, in which the central issue was a federal defense rather than a part of the plaintiff’s claim.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c093c492-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is clear that the restrictive reading <i>Mottley</i> (and numerous other cases) gives to “arising under” is not constitutionally required. Why? After all, both Article III and §1331 speak of cases “arising under” federal law; could that phrase mean different things in the Constitution and in the statute? Yes: The Supreme Court in several cases has said that the meaning of “arising under” in Article III is broader than the same phrase in §1331. Consider what that means.</p>

Be sure you understand why before moving on.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c093eba4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a further corollary, Congress could change the result in <i>Mottley</i> by amending §1331.

<li class=""><p id="c093eba5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a defendant challenges federal question jurisdiction in district court, one of three questions commonly arises:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c093eba6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is there a federal issue at all? If the plaintiff’s claim is based on some federal statute or regulation, the problem consists in interpreting legislation. If the plaintiff claims the right to relief under federal common law, the question is whether such federal common law exists.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c093eba7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Assuming there is a federal issue, does it “give rise to” plaintiff’s claim? That is the question in <i>Mottley</i>.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c093eba8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If there is a federal issue that is not the basis for plaintiff’s claim, is it sufficiently important to “federalize” the case?</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c093eba9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although <i>Mottley</i>’s bright-line test suggests that the answer to 5c is a simple “no,” it turns out that things are a bit more complicated.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c093ebaa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alongside the broad and straight mainstream view reflected in <i>Mottley</i> flows a narrow and meandering rivulet. In this second line of cases the federal courts have assumed “arising under” jurisdiction on the basis of something less—or different—than a claim depending on federal law. Smith v. Kansas City Title &amp; Trust Co., 255 U.S. 180 (1921), is the poster child for this more expansive view. In <i>Smith</i>, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant bank as trustee had violated a state law allowing it to invest only in legal securities. Thus stated, the suit would seem to arise entirely under state law regulating trustees. But the allegedly “illegal” securities were bonds issued by a federal agency under a federal law that plaintiff claimed was unconstitutional. Held: “arising under” jurisdiction. Is <i>Mottley</i>, not cited in <i>Smith</i>, distinguishable?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c093ebab-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has repeatedly tried to define this line of cases, without bringing great clarity to the topic. The Supreme Court’s most recent effort came in Grable &amp; Sons Metal Prod. Inc. v. Darue Eng’g &amp; Mfg., 545 U.S. 308 (2005). Land was sold to satisfy an Internal Revenue Service lien for unpaid taxes. To assure that it had clean title, the purchaser of the land brought a quiet title action in state court, at which point the original owner of the land challenged title, alleging that the notice of the tax lien sale was inadequate. Defendant sought to remove to federal court, arguing that the underlying issue was the adequacy of the IRS system of notice in its tax sales. Federal question jurisdiction was proper, said the Court. In a unanimous opinion, <i>Grable</i> set out a three-part test for such federalized claims: “[T]he question is, does a state-law claim [1] necessarily raise a federal issue, [2] actually <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="215" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page215">p. 215</span>disputed and substantial, [3] which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.” Id. at 314. Lower courts interpreting this test have overwhelmingly remanded such cases to state courts, usually concluding, without much analysis, that the case fails the third of the <i>Grable</i> criteria.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c093ebac-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What’s going on in this “broader” <i>Smith</i> line of cases, cases like <i>Grable</i>? One way of explaining them is to say that the courts thought the federal law interests were important. Important in what way? A monumentally important case with a federal ingredient will eventually make its way to the Supreme Court, which, you’ll recall, has a broader “arising under” jurisdiction than do the district courts. For these cases it makes little difference whether the case is initially heard in a state or federal court.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c093ebad-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the Supreme Court currently hears fewer than a hundred cases a year. So as a practical matter most federal issues litigated in state courts will never reach any federal court. The battle in the statutory “arising under” cases is fought over which federal issue cases should be heard in federal trial and intermediate appellate courts. One thoughtful analysis puts the question like this:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c093ebae-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Federal issues might be raised in a large number of cases, but the claimants of federal rights often are wrong in their view that federal law protects them. They would therefore lose on the federal issue, and they could win only on state law grounds. If “arising under” were interpreted expansively, many cases in federal court on the basis of “arising under” jurisdiction would be disposed of on state law grounds. . . . What is needed is a test that will screen out cases in which federal interests are unlikely to be strongly implicated. Can the following considerations be combined to produce a “test”? (i) What is the national interest in disposing of the case as a whole—with federal fact-finding—in the federal courts, as compared to the interest of disposing of it in the state courts? (ii) How likely is it that the national interest will in fact be implicated? (iii) How likely is it that the Supreme Court will use its limited resources to decide the federal issue where the record is made in the state court?</p>

<p id="c09412c9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Effective lawyers practicing in federal court must learn the sometimes complex boundaries of federal subject matter jurisdiction. They must also learn the consequences of various strategic decisions associated with raising the lack of subject matter jurisdiction in a case. Suppose, for example, you represent a defendant in a case filed in federal district court and you think that there is no basis for federal subject matter jurisdiction over one or more claims in the case. You also think that there’s an argument that the claim should be dismissed on Rule 12(b)(6) grounds, for failure to state a claim. You move to dismiss under both Rule 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(6). Does it matter how that motion to dismiss is decided?</p>

All the dismissal established was that the claim did not arise under federal law; that’s entirely consistent with its arising under state law.</p></li>
<li><p id="c09438db-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the federal court grants the Rule 12(b)(6) motion and the plaintiff refiles the same claim in state court, can defendant argue that the federal dismissal requires dismissal of the state claim? As you will see in Chapter 11, except under special circumstances, a federal Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal operates as a judgment on the merits disposing of the claim. A state court is bound to respect that judgment.</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="c09438dc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose you represent a defendant in a case filed in federal district court and you think that there are grounds to bring a motion to dismiss both for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for lack of personal jurisdiction. If either challenge is well founded, the case will be dismissed. But a dismissal will have different consequences for a refiled suit, depending on which ground is used for dismissal.</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="c09438dd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If a case is dismissed for want of federal subject matter jurisdiction, a plaintiff is free to refile the suit in state court because the judgment establishes only the lack of federal jurisdiction, leaving the state court open.</p></li>

<li><p id="c09438df-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under those circumstances, should a federal court faced with motions to dismiss on both grounds always take subject matter jurisdiction first, because that will have the narrowest subsequent effect? No, the Supreme Court has said; the discretion of a trial court to handle its docket allows it to dismiss for want of personal jurisdiction if that is the most obvious ground, even though that will preclude subsequent state-court litigation in that state. Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co., 526 U.S. 574 (1999).</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="c09438e0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now suppose that the defendant does not move to dismiss. Is the objection to subject matter jurisdiction waived? No: As <i>Mottley</i> demonstrates, the requirement of subject matter jurisdiction is held to be so fundamental that a court is required to raise the issue <i>sua sponte</i> (on the court’s own motion) and dismiss if it finds a lack of jurisdiction. In Capron v. Van Noorden, 6 U.S. 126 (1804), plaintiff sued defendant in federal court and lost. On appeal in the Supreme Court, plaintiff suggested a lack of jurisdiction because of lack of diversity. The Supreme Court dismissed the case, leaving the plaintiff free to try again in state court (assuming that the statute of limitations had not yet run).</p>
<p id="c09438e1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given the draconian rules about the nonwaivability of federal subject matter jurisdiction, one might expect it would be easy to mount a collateral attack on a judgment alleged to be without federal jurisdiction. In fact, the answer is “probably not,” though the few cases that have dealt with this question have not been <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="218" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page218">p. 218</span>resolved consistently. To get a feel for the problem, consider three situations: (1) defendant appears, challenges subject matter jurisdiction and loses; (2) defendant appears, fails to challenge subject matter jurisdiction, but loses on the merits; and (3) defendant defaults. In each case, the question is whether in a second lawsuit the former defendant may seek to avoid the effect of the first judgment by arguing that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="c09438e2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Parties who appear, challenge the subject matter jurisdiction of a federal court, and lose are bound by that determination; just as with personal jurisdiction, they may not thereafter challenge the judgment in a second action. Stoll v. Gottlieb, 305 U.S. 165 (1938).</p></li>
<li><p id="c09438e3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, and again as with personal jurisdiction, parties who have appeared but failed to challenge the subject matter jurisdiction of a district court may generally not thereafter attack its judgment in another court for lack of diversity or federal question jurisdiction—absent a statute authorizing such a challenge. Chicot County Drainage District v. Baxter State Bank, 308 U.S. 371 (1939); Kalb v. Feuerstein, 308 U.S. 433 (1940).</p></li>

<p id="c0946001-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In order to provide a federal forum for plaintiffs who seek to vindicate federal rights, Congress has conferred on the district courts original jurisdiction in federal-question cases—civil actions that arise under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. 28 U.S.C. §1331. In order to provide a neutral forum for what have come to be known as diversity cases, Congress also has granted district courts original jurisdiction in civil actions between citizens of different States, between U.S. citizens and foreign citizens, or by foreign states against U.S. citizens. §1332.</p>

<p id="c0946003-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An early case relying on the neutral forum justification while making important law regarding diversity jurisdiction was Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 7 U.S. 267 (1806). Although 28 U.S.C. §1332 does not by its terms require that each plaintiff be diverse from each defendant, that interpretation was attached to the predecessor statute by Chief Justice Marshall in <i>Strawbridge</i>, and has been unquestioned law ever since. Thus even in a case with multiple diverse parties the existence of a single party with the same state citizenship as that of an opposing party will destroy diversity. The theory, apparently, was that if citizens of the same state are on both sides of a case, a state court cannot discriminate against an out-of-state party without harming its own. As an opinion written more than 200 years after <i>Strawbridge</i> explained it:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0948714-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The complete diversity requirement is not mandated by the Constitution, or by the plain text of §1332(a). The Court, nonetheless, has adhered to the complete diversity rule in light of <i>the purpose of the diversity requirement, which is to provide a federal forum for important disputes where state courts might favor, or be perceived as favoring, home-state litigants</i>. The presence of parties from the same State on both sides of a case dispels this concern, eliminating a principal reason for conferring §1332 jurisdiction over any of the claims in the action.</p>

<p id="c0948716-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But in some instances Congress has legislated in ways suggesting a broader function for diversity than providing a neutral forum.

The idea would be that some cases have national scope and implication and should be heard in a federal court, even if the governing law is state law. For our purposes the question is not whether the “neutral forum” or the “national case” justification for diversity is correct. Instead it is how uncertainty about diversity’s purpose plays itself out in the cases.</p>

<p id="c094ae33-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In responding to the motion, plaintiff does not really defend the idea of jurisdiction based upon his location in France, but shifts the ground to a discussion of his connection with California. Plaintiff has filed an affidavit stating that he was raised and educated in California commencing in 1948, and that while he has resided in France for the last several years (his attorney’s brief says since 1990), he has maintained certain contacts with California, including a license to practice law, and a law office there which he states he has visited at least four times a year since living abroad.

A person is a citizen of a state of the United States within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. §1332 if he is a citizen of the United States and is domiciled within the state in question. Newman-Green Inc. v.

<li class=""><p id="c094ae41-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, because the statute does not define the meaning of state “citizenship,” and because, unlike the national government, states do not issue any formal documents to show that one is a “citizen” of California or Florida or Illinois, courts have developed a test of state citizenship. The standard doctrinal formulation says that state citizenship depends on present domicile and intent to remain indefinitely. That test is easy to apply for most people, who have a single clear affiliation.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c094ae42-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But, like Mr. Redner, many people may reside “temporarily” in a different place for considerable periods. Thus a student who is attending law school in New York might for diversity purposes still be a citizen of Florida. In such cases, much may turn on intent, as demonstrated by external indicia. Consider, for example, <i>Hawkins v. Masters Farms</i>, supra page 7. Notice that the factual issues involved in such determinations can require significant inquiry at the outset of the lawsuit, inquiry unrelated to the merits of the case. Does this make the relatively mindless simplicity of the well-pleaded complaint rule look better by comparison?</p></li>

For example, a party wishing to invoke diversity jurisdiction cannot achieve it simply by assigning his claim to an out-of-state representative. But the courts are not unanimous in what is “improper.” The statute resolves one situation: For diversity purposes the representative of a child, an incompetent, or a deceased person (appointed to administer the estate) has the same citizenship as the individual represented. 28 U.S.C. §1332(c)(2).

Section 1332(c) provides that, unlike natural persons, corporations can have <i>two</i> states of citizenship—that of the state that incorporates them and that of their “principal place of business,” if it is different from the state of incorporation. Congress added this provision in 1958 to remedy complaints that too many “home” corporations were able to invoke diversity citizenship by incorporating out of state. For decades thereafter courts struggled with inconsistent tests about how to define the corporation’s “principal place of business.” After half a century of disagreement, the Supreme Court stepped in to settle the matter.</p></li>

<p id="c094fc88-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The federal diversity jurisdiction statute provides that “a corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of any State by which it has been incorporated <i>and of the State where it has its principal place of business.</i>” 28 U.S.C. §1332(c)(1) (emphasis added). We seek here to resolve different interpretations that the Circuits have given this phrase. In doing so, we place primary weight upon the need for judicial <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="226" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page226">p. 226</span>administration of a jurisdictional statute to remain as simple as possible. And we conclude that the phrase “principal place of business” refers to the place where the corporation’s high level officers direct, control, and coordinate the corporation’s activities. Lower federal courts have often metaphorically called that place the corporation’s “nerve center.” We believe that the “nerve center” will typically be found at a corporation’s headquarters. . . . </p>
<p id="c094fc89-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The case grew from a class action. Hertz employees in California alleged that Hertz had failed to conform to California’s wage and hour laws. Hertz sought to remove to federal court, invoking diversity jurisdiction. The employees resisted with the argument that California was a principal place of business for Hertz, since it derived more revenue from that state than any other and the plurality of its business activities also occurred there. Reasoning that, because of this business activity Hertz was, like them, a citizen of California, the plaintiffs resisted removal. The District Court found that Hertz was a citizen of California, relying on Ninth Circuit precedent instructing “courts to identify a corporation’s ’principal place of business’ by first determining the amount of a corporation’s business activity State by State. If the amount of activity is ’significantly larger’ or ’substantially predominates’ in one State, then that State is the corporation’s ’principal place of business.’” The Ninth Circuit affirmed. The Supreme Court reviewed the history of “principal place of business” and its judicial interpretations.]</p>

<p id="c095239c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In an effort to find a single, more uniform interpretation of the statutory phrase, we have reviewed the Courts of Appeals’ divergent and increasingly complex interpretations. Having done so, we now return to, and expand, Judge Weinfeld’s approach, as applied [in a case decided shortly after the 1958 amendment to §1332 created dual corporate citizenship]. We conclude that “principal place of business” is best read as referring to the place where a corporation’s officers direct, control, and coordinate the corporation’s activities. It is the place that Courts of Appeals have called the corporation’s “nerve center.” And in practice it should normally be the place where the corporation maintains its headquarters—provided that the headquarters is the actual center of direction, control, and coordination, <i>i.e.</i>, the “nerve center,” and not simply an office where the corporation holds its board meetings (for example, attended by directors and officers who have traveled there for the occasion).</p>
<p id="c095239d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Three sets of considerations, taken together, convince us that this approach, while imperfect, is superior to other possibilities. First, the statute’s language supports the approach. The statute’s text deems a corporation a citizen of the “State where it has its principal place of business.” 28 U.S.C. §1332(c)(1). The word “place” is in the singular, not the plural. . . . </p>
<p id="c095239e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, administrative simplicity is a major virtue in a jurisdictional statute. Complex jurisdictional tests complicate a case, eating up time and money as the parties litigate, not the merits of their claims, but which court is the right court <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="227" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page227">p. 227</span>to decide those claims. Complex tests produce appeals and reversals, encourage gamesmanship, and, again, diminish the likelihood that results and settlements will reflect a claim’s legal and factual merits. Judicial resources too are at stake. Courts have an independent obligation to determine whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists, even when no party challenges it. So courts benefit from straightforward rules under which they can readily assure themselves of their power to hear a case.</p>
<p id="c095239f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, the statute’s legislative history, for those who accept it, offers a simplicity-related interpretive benchmark. The Judicial Conference provided an initial version of its proposal that suggested a numerical test. A corporation would be deemed a citizen of the State that accounted for more than half of its gross income. The Conference changed its mind in light of criticism that such a test would prove too complex and impractical to apply. That history suggests that the words “principal place of business” should be interpreted to be no more complex than the initial “half of gross income” test. A “nerve center” test offers such a possibility. A general business activities test does not.</p>

<p id="c09523a1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We recognize that there may be no perfect test that satisfies all administrative and purposive criteria. We recognize as well that, under the “nerve center” test we adopt today, there will be hard cases. For example, in this era of telecommuting, some corporations may divide their command and coordinating functions among officers who work at several different locations, perhaps communicating over the Internet. That said, our test nonetheless points courts in a single direction, towards the center of overall direction, control, and coordination. Courts do not have to try to weigh corporate functions, assets, or revenues different in kind, one from the other. Our approach provides a sensible test that is relatively easier to apply, not a test that will, in all instances, automatically generate a result.</p>
<p id="c09523a2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We also recognize that the use of a “nerve center” test may in some cases produce results that seem to cut against the basic rationale for 28 U.S.C. §1332. For example, if the bulk of a company’s business activities visible to the public take place in New Jersey, while its top officers direct those activities just across the river in New York, the “principal place of business” is New York. One could argue that members of the public in New Jersey would be <i>less</i> likely to be prejudiced against the corporation than persons in New York—yet the corporation will still be entitled to remove a New Jersey state case to federal court. And note too that the same corporation would be unable to remove a New York state case to federal court, despite the New York public’s presumed prejudice against the corporation.</p>
<p id="c09523a3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We understand that such seeming anomalies will arise. However, in view of the necessity of having a clearer rule, we must accept them. Accepting occasionally counterintuitive results is the price the legal system must pay to avoid overly complex jurisdictional administration while producing the benefits that accompany a more uniform legal system. . . . </p>

Coudert was a law firm based in New York City. Most of its partners were citizens of New York, but a few partners were U.S. citizens living in France and working at their Paris office. Defendants were U.S. and foreign citizens. Coudert filed in state court and defendants sought to remove. Held: case remanded to state court. “If we were dealing with the situation where a partnership had partners who were citizens of New York and citizens of France, there would be diversity jurisdiction under subdivision (3) of the statute. However our case is different. The status of the Coudert partners residing in France is that they are still citizens of the United States and are not citizens of France. If these partners were suing by themselves they would not fit within any of the categories referred to in the statute, since they are neither citizens of a state of the United States nor are they citizens or subjects of a foreign state. . . . It would appear to be a logical extension of the rules of law referred to above that the Coudert partnership is not a party who can sue in federal court under diversity jurisdiction.” Id. at 526-27.

<p id="c0954ac3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Besides diversity, §1332 requires an amount greater than $75,000 in controversy. Congress has from time to time increased this amount, most recently in 1997, from $50,000 to the present figure. Given modern understandings of inflation, one can imagine that Congress might “index” the amount in controversy, linking it to some widely accepted measure of inflation. (Congress has pegged post-judgment interest to the rate of widely traded government notes.) What are the arguments for—and against—such a move?</p>
<p id="c0954ac4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whatever the dollar figure, the courts have treated this requirement in much the same way as they have the issue of federal question jurisdiction—that is, they have by and large viewed the allegations of the pleading as all but controlling, rather than engaging in judicial guessing about the likelihood that the plaintiff would succeed in collecting as much as he had prayed for. The leading Supreme Court case, St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co., 303 U.S. 283, 289 (1938), stated as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0954ac5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It must appear to a legal certainty that the claim is really for less than the jurisdictional amount to justify dismissal. The inability of plaintiff to recover an amount adequate to give the court jurisdiction does not show his bad faith or oust the jurisdiction. Nor does the fact that the complaint discloses the existence of a valid defense of the claim. But if, from the face of the pleadings, it is apparent, to a legal certainty, that the plaintiff cannot recover the amount claimed, or if, from the proofs, the court is satisfied to a <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="230" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page230">p. 230</span>like certainty that the plaintiff never was entitled to recover that amount, and that his claim was therefore colorable for the purpose of conferring jurisdiction, the suit will be dismissed.</p>
</div>
<p id="c0954ac6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the courts’ trust in the pleadings is not boundless. Consider, for example, a plaintiff who brought a diversity action against a hotel, alleging its security personnel had assaulted him; the likely compensatory damages were small, but the plaintiff relied on a punitive damage count to lift him over the amount in controversy:</p>

Instead, he argues that he satisfies the jurisdictional requirement because he is entitled to recovery of punitive damages that could result in a verdict in excess of $75,000.</p>

<p id="c0954acb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In another respect, the Supreme Court has suggested that the amount in controversy requirement differs from the requirement of complete diversity. The issue surfaced in Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Servs., Inc., 545 U.S. 546 (2005). In <i>Allapattah</i> the Court had to decide whether to include within the supplemental jurisdiction granted by 28 U.S.C. §1367 (discussed infra at pages 232-35) claims held by parties who met the diversity requirement but for less than $75,000. Yes, said the court, in part because the amount in controversy requirement was less central to the idea of diversity jurisdiction:</p>

The Court. . . . has adhered to the complete diversity rule in light of the purpose of the diversity requirement, which is to provide a federal forum for important disputes where state courts might favor, or be perceived as favoring, home-state litigants.

The basic principle is to try to value the injunction, using one of several approaches: Determine the value of the injunction to the plaintiff; determine the cost to the defendant of complying; determine the cost or value to the party invoking federal jurisdiction (the plaintiff, if the action is brought in federal court, and the defendant, if the action was brought in state court and defendant is attempting to remove); and allow jurisdiction if any of the tests above yields a figure above $75,000.

Basically, when a plaintiff’s claim exceeds $75,000 (the statutory amount), a compulsory counterclaim may be heard regardless of amount. A permissive counterclaim not arising from the same transaction or occurrence requires an independent jurisdictional basis. The law is unsettled, however, when plaintiff’s claim falls short of $75,000 but defendant’s counterclaim increases the amount in controversy to more than $75,000. See generally Wright, Federal Courts 217 (reporting “virtually no holdings” addressing the question).</p></li>

Its rationale emerges more clearly if one recalls that a central feature of the Federal Rules is the ease with which they permit joinder of claims. See, e.g., Rule 18(a). It would be logically possible, but awkward, to permit parties to join closely connected claims but then deny the federal courts power over claims that did not bring their own jurisdictional basis with them. In such situations, whichever court (state or federal) tried the related claim second would have to engage in elaborate analyses of which issues were precluded in the first lawsuit. Section 1367 allows some—but not all—of these related claims to come to federal court under the wing of supplemental jurisdiction.</p></li>

<p id="c095c035-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In her Amended Complaint, Skanes alleges that in April 2004, she consummated a mortgage transaction with Ameriquest. Shortly before the close of the transaction, Ameriquest ordered from co-defendant Homestead Appraisal of Rockford a property appraisal of Skanes’ future home. Homestead, through its agent Trevino [appraised the house at] $163,000. . . . </p>

[When the adjustable rate reset, Skanes could not refinance.]</p>
<p id="c095c037-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Count I of the complaint alleged a claim against Ameriquest under the federal Truth in Lending Act (TILA), seeking both rescission of the mortgage and statutory damages.] In Count I, her TILA claim, Skanes further states that at the time of her closing, Ameriquest provided her with improper and misleading disclosures of her right to cancel her mortgage. Ameriquest’s disclosures, she alleges, triggered an extended right for her to later rescind her mortgage. [Counts II and III alleged state law fraud claims against all defendants.] In addition, Skanes requests that we enter a “judgment declaring what obligation, if any, plaintiff has toward each defendant [following rescission], <i>taking into account. . . . the inflated appraised value</i>” (emphasis added). . . . </p>

<p id="c095c03a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">28 U.S.C. §1367 provides that in any action in which we already have jurisdiction over some federal claim, we also have supplemental jurisdiction over state claims “that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution.. . . . A loose factual connection may be sufficient to confer supplemental jurisdiction, so long as those facts are both common and operative. To determine whether the federal and state law claims are connected by common and operative facts, “[c]ourts routinely compare the facts necessary to prove the elements of the federal claim with those necessary to the success of the state claim.” We also may ask “whether the state claims can be resolved or dismissed without affecting the federal claims.”</p>
<p id="c095c03b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, Skanes explicitly connected her federal and state claims, such that we cannot now conclude that her state claims could be dismissed or resolved without affecting her TILA claim. As set forth in the Amended Complaint, the facts underlying her state and federal claims combine to tell one story: Skanes did not fully know of her right to cancel her mortgage at its outset; because that mortgage was overstated, she paid too much during the life of her loan; and—also because of the overstatement—she has not been able to refinance the mortgage. Alleging a [federal] TILA disclosure violation, Skanes now wishes to void her allegedly overstated mortgage. In doing so, Skanes expressly links her TILA prayer for relief to her state claims. Skanes seeks a judgment voiding her mortgage and a judgment declaring what, if any, payment obligation exists after taking into account Skanes’ state law challenge to her home appraisal.</p>
<p id="c095c03c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We find this connection operative: if we dismiss Counts II and III, we may be unable to grant the full measure of relief Skanes seeks in Count I: if she is entitled to rescission, and she is correct that her home value was over-appraised, then she may be (or may not be—we do not intend to decide that issue here) entitled to reduce the post-TILA judgment tender amount in light of the over-appraisal. Without a <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="237" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page237">p. 237</span>determination of the over-appraisal issue, though, that offset would be unavailable. Because we cannot conclude that the resolution of one of her state claims will have no effect on the resolution on her federal claims, we cannot deny our supplemental jurisdiction here.</p>

<p id="c095c03e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if we find that we have supplemental jurisdiction over a plaintiff’s state law claims, 28 U.S.C. §1367[(c)] provides four instances in which we may choose not to exercise that jurisdiction: “(1) the claim raises a novel or complex issue of State law; (2) the claim substantially predominates over the claim or claims over which the district court has original jurisdiction; (3) the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction; or (4) in exceptional circumstances, there are other compelling reasons for declining jurisdiction.”</p>
<p id="c095c03f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not perceive a problem with respect to factors (2) through (4): we cannot tell from the face of the Amended Complaint that Skanes’ inflated appraisal allegations “substantially predominate” over her TILA claims; we have not dismissed Skanes’ TILA claims; and Trevino has not highlighted any persuasive “exceptional circumstances” or “compelling reasons” for us to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction. Nor are we persuaded that because the Michigan Mortgage Brokers, Lenders and Servicers Lending Act [a state statute] has not been specifically applied to appraisers or appraisal services, we will not be able to resolve Skanes’ claims through reference to existing precedent (which, by the time this case has concluded, could well include applications of the MMBLSLA to appraisers and appraisal services). Accordingly, we choose to exercise our discretion in favor of retaining jurisdiction over Counts II and III of the Amended Complaint. . . . </p>

<p id="c095e756-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In March 2005, Szendrey received a report from an external law firm that included information about possible ethical and/or legal violations committed by bank officials in relation to the accounting for the bulk purchase of mortgage loans from other financial institutions. Szendrey conducted an investigation into this issue, focusing on the possibility of whether the bank officials’ conduct amounted to a violation of law or the bank’s Code of Ethics. Upon conclusion of such investigation, Szendrey concluded that there had been irregularities and violations of the Code of Ethics and reported such findings to outside counsel for the bank as well as bank officials. She also divulged her findings to the Board of Directors at a meeting in which she was present. . . . </p>

<p id="c095e759-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Upon careful consideration of the issues presented by this case, and the law governing such issues, we decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the P.R. law claims. Accordingly, these claims will be dismissed without prejudice, and Defendants’ arguments for dismissal on the merits of such claims are thus moot. As for the Title VII discrimination and retaliation claims, they survive the motion to dismiss. This case thus goes forward solely under Title VII. We explain our reasoning below. . . . </p>
<p id="c095e75a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court finds that two of §1367(c)’s subsections are at issue here: (1) that the state law claims raise complex or novel issues and (2) that the state-law claims substantially predominate over the federal claim. We start with the latter and work our way back to the former.</p>
<p id="c095e75b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs’ complaint includes two lonesome claims under Title VII, for discrimination and retaliation thereunder. The remaining claims all arise out of P.R. law. Not only do the P.R. law claims far outnumber the federal claims, but their scope also exceeds that of the federal claims. On that point we note that although some of the P.R. law claims mimic the federal claims. . . . the remaining P.R. law claims (wrongful discharge, tortious actions infringing Plaintiff’s constitutional rights, tortious interference with contracts, and defamation) are distinct and each has its own elements of proof; proof that is not necessary to establish the Title VII claims. That the state-law claims predominate over the federal claims is, in and of itself, reason enough to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.</p>
<p id="c095e75c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, we note that the P.R. law claims require a much fuller incursion into the performance of Szendrey as General Counsel and any shortcomings she may have had as such. This, in turn, leads us to the other reason for declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction: the presence of complex or novel issues of state law. The main issue raised by Defendants in their motion to dismiss, that Plaintiffs’ prosecution of their claims would run afoul of Canon 21 of the Puerto Rico Code of Professional Ethics, is at its apex in the P.R. law claims. For example, in order to prove that Defendants defamed her, Szendrey would have to establish that what was said about her (i.e., that she participated in wrongful acts) was false. In order to prove such falsity, Szendrey would have to reveal the extent of her participation regarding such wrongful acts, including what information she became aware of as General Counsel, what actions she took after learning such information, and what advice she offered her client with regards to such information. [Defendants argued that Canon 21 of Puerto Rican legal ethics rules forbade a lawyer from disclosing client confidences, even in litigation between lawyer and client.]</p>
<p id="c095e75d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Canon 21 undisputably belongs to an exclusively Puerto Rican body of law, and one that deals with the highly sensitive matter of lawyers’ conduct, and its relation to society’s interest in a fully functioning legal system. The interpretation of the canons <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="239" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page239">p. 239</span>is normally the province of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, which is entrusted with the regulation and supervision of the legal profession. We note, moreover, that Canon 21 is decidedly different to the corresponding Model Rule of the American Bar Association. Unlike this Court and several U.S. jurisdictions, Puerto Rico has not adopted the latest version of the American Bar Association’s Model Rules.</p>
<p id="c095e75e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Canon 21 is decidedly silent on the issue of a lawyer’s claim—whether in-house or not—against his former client, and the possibility of divulging confidential information in order to pursue such a claim. . . . This is an issue of Puerto Rico law that has yet to be addressed by the Puerto Rico courts and which is imbued with important considerations of public policy. . . . </p>
<p id="c0960e6f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the Puerto Rico law claims substantially predominate over the federal claims in this case, and because they posit novel and complex issues of state law, the Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Puerto Rico law claims will be dismissed without prejudice, so that Plaintiffs may re-file them in the Puerto Rico courts. . . . </p>

Even if the federal and state claims in this action arise out of the same factual situation, litigating these claims together may not serve judicial economy or trial convenience. Federal and state law each have a different focus, and the two bodies of law have evolved at different times and in different legislative and judicial systems.

<li class=""><p id="c0965cb4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Same problem as in 2a. Defendant removes, invoking diversity.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc., 230 F.3d 868 (6th Cir. 2000), affirmed a denial of the remand motion, saying that the propriety of removal should be judged by the apparent amount in controversy at the time removal is sought.</p></li>

<p id="c09682d2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress, while unwilling to repeal diversity jurisdiction, has restricted it in a number of small ways.</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="c09682d3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It has retained and occasionally increased the amount in controversy requirement.</p></li>

</ul>
<p id="c09682d7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These restrictions reflect a low-level continuing debate about the contemporary <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="243" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page243">p. 243</span>usefulness of diversity jurisdiction. Most observers do not think that discrimination based on state citizenship (as opposed to other characteristics) plays a major role in the United States today. <i>If</i> the only reason for diversity jurisdiction were to guard against such discrimination, then one could challenge its contemporary role.</p>
<p id="c09682d8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defenses of diversity jurisdiction take several forms. Some argue that by providing “competition” for state courts, federal diversity cases raise the standards of some state judiciaries. Others argue that by providing a stream of “ordinary” cases (auto accidents, contract disputes), diversity cases prevent federal judges from becoming narrow specialists. Still others argue a variation on traditional justifications for diversity: Even if bias against out-of-staters is not strong, in many regions there <i>is</i> a bias in favor of “the home team” and that diversity jurisdiction prevents that type of bias from distorting litigation outcomes.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c09682da-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Take, for example, The Formula Inc. v. Mammoth 8050 LLC, 2008 WL 60428 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 3, 2008). Formula filed its complaint in state court in Florida, and served a Summons and Complaint on Mammoth on October 23, 2007. On November 26, 2007, Mammoth removed the case to federal court based on diversity of citizenship. The district court remanded the case to state court on the ground that the removal was untimely.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c09682db-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mammoth erroneously calculated the thirty day time frame so as not to include November 23, 2007 (believing that the Court was closed the day after Thanksgiving) and failed to file a notice of removal until November 26, 2007. Technically, November 23rd is not a legal holiday, as defined for instance in Federal Rule 6(a)(4)—only Thanksgiving Day itself is a legal holiday. Admittedly, the day after Thanksgiving is, for all practical purposes, a day in which many people do not go to work to kickoff the holiday buying-spree season (i.e., Black Friday). It is thus understandable that one may treat that day as a continuation of the Thanksgiving holiday. But no Federal statute, Court Rule, or Court Order deems that Friday as a holiday per se. . . . Mammoth concedes this fact but argues that, under the circumstances, there is good cause to excuse this technical one-day delay. The Court, however, is duty bound to strictly apply and enforce section 1446(b) that is an express statutory requirement for removal. The statute was drafted in mandatory language ("shall be filed within thirty days") and, thus, the failure to comply with the statute “can fairly be said to render the removal ’defective’ and justify a remand pursuant to Section 1447(c).”</p>

<li class=""><p id="c096a9ec-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Or consider Schafer v. Bayer Cropscience LP, 2010 WL 1038518 (E.D. Ark. Mar. 19, 2010).

Bayer removed the case on September 17, 2009, but the case was remanded to state court. After the state court severed nondiverse plaintiffs from the case, Bayer again removed the case to federal court on March 16, 2010. This time, the district court remanded the case to state court on the ground that the removal was untimely because it occurred more than one year after the case was first filed. The court acknowledged that Bayer was not a defendant in the case until more than one year after it had been filed.</p>

<p id="c096a9f4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question presented is whether the absence of complete diversity at the time of removal is fatal to federal-court adjudication.

<p id="c096a9f5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent James David Lewis, a resident of Kentucky, filed this lawsuit in Kentucky state court on June 22, 1989, after sustaining injuries while operating a bulldozer. Asserting state-law claims based on defective manufacture, negligent maintenance, failure to warn, and breach of warranty, Lewis named as defendants both the manufacturer of the bulldozer—petitioner Caterpillar Inc., a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Illinois—and the company that serviced the bulldozer—Whayne Supply Company, a Kentucky corporation with its principal place of business in Kentucky.</p>
<p id="c096a9f6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Several months later, Liberty Mutual Insurance Group, the insurance carrier for Lewis’ employer, intervened in the lawsuit as a plaintiff. A Massachusetts corporation with its principal place of business in that State, Liberty Mutual asserted subrogation claims against both Caterpillar and Whayne Supply for workers’ compensation benefits Liberty Mutual had paid to Lewis on behalf of his employer.</p>

Shortly after learning of this agreement, Caterpillar filed a notice of removal, on June 21, 1990, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky. Grounding federal jurisdiction on diversity of citizenship, Caterpillar satisfied with only a day to spare the statutory requirement that a diversity-based removal take place within one year of a lawsuit’s commencement, see 28 U.S.C. §1446(b).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10AE9_d543b177-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10AE9_d543b177-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*1</a></span> Caterpillar’s notice of removal explained that the case was nonremovable at the lawsuit’s start: Complete diversity was absent then because plaintiff Lewis and defendant Whayne Supply shared Kentucky citizenship. Proceeding on the understanding that the settlement agreement between these two Kentucky parties would result in the dismissal of Whayne Supply from the lawsuit, Caterpillar stated that the settlement rendered the case removable.</p>
<p id="c096d109-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lewis objected to the removal and moved to remand the case to state court. Lewis acknowledged that he had settled his own claims against Whayne Supply. But Liberty Mutual had not yet settled its subrogation claim against Whayne Supply, Lewis asserted. Whayne Supply’s presence as a defendant in the lawsuit, Lewis urged, defeated diversity of citizenship. Without addressing this argument, the District Court denied Lewis’ motion to remand on September 24, 1990, treating as dispositive Lewis’ admission that he had settled his own claims against Whayne Supply.</p>
<p id="c096d10a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In June 1993, [Liberty Mutual and Whayne settled]. . . . With Caterpillar as the sole defendant adverse to Lewis, the case proceeded to a 6-day jury trial in November 1993, ending in a unanimous verdict for Caterpillar. . . . </p>
<p id="c096d10b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We note, initially, two “givens” in this case as we have accepted it for review. First, the District Court, in its decision denying Lewis’ timely motion to remand, incorrectly treated Whayne Supply, the nondiverse defendant, as effectively dropped from the case prior to removal. Second, the Sixth Circuit correctly determined that the complete diversity requirement was not satisfied at the time of removal. We accordingly home in on this question: Does the District Court’s initial misjudgment still burden and run with the case, or is it overcome by the eventual dismissal of the nondiverse defendant? . . . </p>
<p id="c096d10c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having preserved his objection to an improper removal, Lewis urges that an “all’s well that ends well” approach is inappropriate here. He maintains that ultimate satisfaction of the subject-matter jurisdiction requirement ought not swallow up antecedent statutory violations. The course Caterpillar advocates, Lewis observes, would disfavor diligent plaintiffs who timely, but unsuccessfully, move to check improper removals in district court. Further, that course would allow improperly removing defendants to profit from their disregard of Congress’ instructions, and their ability to lead district judges into error.</p>
<p id="c096d10d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Concretely, in this very case, Lewis emphasizes, adherence to the rules Congress prescribed for removal would have kept the case in state court. Only by removing prematurely was Caterpillar able to get to federal court inside the 1-year limitation set in §1446(b). Had Caterpillar waited until the case was ripe for removal, i.e., until Whayne Supply was dismissed as a defendant, the 1-year limitation would have barred the way, and plaintiff’s choice of forum would have been preserved.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10B0A_d543b177-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10B0A_d543b177-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">14</a></span> These <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="246" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page246">p. 246</span>arguments are hardly meritless, but they run up against an overriding consideration.

<p id="c096d10f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our view is in harmony with a main theme of the removal scheme Congress devised. Congress ordered a procedure calling for expeditious superintendence by district courts. The lawmakers specified a short time, 30 days, for motions to remand for defects in removal procedure, 28 U.S.C. §1447(c), and district court orders remanding cases to state courts generally are “not reviewable on appeal or otherwise,” §1447(d). Congress did not similarly exclude appellate review of refusals to remand. But an evident concern that may explain the lack of symmetry relates to the federal courts’ subject-matter jurisdiction. Despite a federal trial court’s threshold denial of a motion to remand, if, at the end of the day and case, a jurisdictional defect remains uncured, the judgment must be vacated. See Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 12(h)(3) (“Whenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action.”) In this case, however, no jurisdictional defect lingered through judgment in the District Court. To wipe out the adjudication postjudgment, and return to state court a case now satisfying all federal jurisdictional requirements, would impose an exorbitant cost on our dual court system, a cost incompatible with the fair and unprotracted administration of justice. Lewis ultimately argues that, if the final judgment against him is allowed to stand, “all of the various procedural requirements for removal will become unenforceable”; therefore, “defendants will have an enormous incentive to attempt wrongful removals.” In particular, Lewis suggests that defendants will remove prematurely “in the hope that some subsequent developments, such as the eventual dismissal of nondiverse defendants, will permit the case to be kept in federal court.” We do not anticipate the dire consequences Lewis forecasts.</p>
<p id="c096d110-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The procedural requirements for removal remain enforceable by the federal trial court judges to whom those requirements are directly addressed. Lewis’ prediction. . . . rests on an assumption we do not indulge—that district courts generally will not comprehend, or will balk at applying, the rules on removal Congress has prescribed. The prediction furthermore assumes defendants’ readiness to gamble that any jurisdictional defect, for example, the absence of complete diversity, will first escape detection, then disappear prior to judgment. The well-advised defendant, we are satisfied, will foresee the likely outcome of an unwarranted removal—a swift and nonreviewable remand order, see 28 U.S.C. §1447(c), (d), attended by the displeasure of a district court whose authority has been improperly invoked. The odds against any gain from a wrongful removal, in sum, render improbable Lewis’ projection of increased resort to the maneuver.</p>

<p id="c096f828-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Ginsburg, whose Supreme Court nomination was confirmed in 1993, had two careers before assuming her present position, both of which mark her pioneering role as a woman in the legal profession.</p>
<p id="c096f829-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having earned a distinguished record both at Harvard and Columbia Law Schools, Ginsburg found herself highly recommended as a clerk to Justice Felix Frankfurter of the Supreme Court by the dean of Harvard Law School. Frankfurter reportedly turned her down because she was a woman—a practice in which Frankfurter was then not alone among his fellow Justices. Nor, in spite of having been first in her law school class, was she offered a job by any of the 12 New York law firms with whom she interviewed. A similar pattern marked her entry into academia. Initially appointed as a research associate at Columbia Law School, she taught at Rutgers-Newark for ten years before accepting an appointment in 1972 as the first tenured woman in the history of Columbia Law School. Her academic specialties included comparative civil procedure and conflicts of law.</p>
<p id="c096f82a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While teaching, Ginsburg co-founded the Women’s Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union and briefed and argued before the U.S. Supreme Court several pioneering gender discrimination cases. Press accounts credit her with a strategy of small, incremental steps and choosing unthreatening lead plaintiffs—frequently men—in her cases. One account described her strategy as “not expect[ing] to force social change; she wanted [instead] to ’give it a green light’ in her words, and she moved the Justices to send that signal through a series of simple, scarcely controversial cases.”</p>

See §1446(c). Notice that in some cases this time limit allows plaintiffs an opportunity to manipulate jurisdiction, joining nondiverse parties and then dropping them after a year. But note as well that 28 U.S.C. §1446(c)(1) allows removal even after a year if the plaintiff has acted in “bad faith” to block removal.</p></li>

The Supreme Court dismissed the case—so the plaintiff won by challenging the very jurisdiction he had invoked! Contrast <i>Caterpillar</i>, in which the plaintiff properly and accurately objected to removal. But the Court in <i>Caterpillar</i>, acknowledging that diversity did not exist at the time of removal, nevertheless affirmed the federal judgment. Can one distinguish the two cases?</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0971f47-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (SLUSA) (15 U.S.C. §77p(b)) takes matters one step further—and takes us back to <i>Mottley</i>, which began this chapter. First, SLUSA (how’s that for an attractive acronym?) preempts state securities class actions alleging fraud in the sales of securities. It provides, in other words, that in such cases federal law displaces otherwise applicable state law. Second, it provides that securities fraud class actions based entirely on state law “shall be removable to the federal district court for the district in which the action is pending.” 15 U.S.C. §77p(c). Finally, it orders dismissal of the removed class actions. This three-step process provides a review of much of this chapter. Congress has essentially created a federal defense to state law securities class actions. Think back to <i>Mottley</i>, in which a federal defense to a state law claim did not create “arising under” jurisdiction. Congress might have left things there, relying on the state courts and occasional Supreme Court review to enforce this scheme. But SLUSA goes beyond that, using removal jurisdiction to assure that its substantive preemption of state law will be systematically enforced. In this specific category of cases SLUSA creates exactly what <i>Mottley</i> rejected: federal jurisdiction, here removal jurisdiction, based on a federal defense to a state law claim.</p></li>

As a final reminder of the extent to which federal jurisdiction is a creature of statute, consider 28 U.S.C. §1445. It forbids removal of some actions—among them workers’ compensation claims and suits brought under the federal Violence Against Women Act—that otherwise would be removable under §1441. Examine that statute and consider why Congress might have made such actions nonremovable and thus allowed plaintiffs to dictate the choice between state and federal court.</p></li>

<p id="c0971f4a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The jurisdictional reach of U.S. federal courts has played an important and often controversial role in the nation’s history. Over the past two centuries these courts, sometimes denounced as protectors of powerful national corporations, sometimes denounced and simultaneously hailed as vindicators of racial justice and the rights of women, have also played a homelier role in everyday disputes, ranging from the claim of a worker to his wages to claims arising from auto accidents involving out-of-state tourists. The overlapping jurisdictions of the state and federal courts also figure in lawyers’ strategy, as they maneuver to gain (or avoid) a forum with characteristics that often differ from those of the state courts.</p>
<p id="c0971f4b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not too long ago, those federal courts also represented an escape from state law, even on claims based on state law.

C is wrong because removal is available only if the original case could have been brought in federal court—and this one could not.

A is wrong because the diversity statute requires <i>both</i> diversity and the stated amount in controversy. C is wrong because a resident of the forum state cannot remove if the only basis for jurisdiction is diversity—as is the case here. D is wrong because the “except” clause of §1332(a)(2) treats lawful permanent residents as citizens of the state where they reside, and so plaintiff and defendant are not diverse.</p>
<p id="c09794aa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q3.</b> B and C are correct responses. A is wrong because an injunction may be “valued,” and diversity jurisdiction will lie if that value exceeds $75,000. D is wrong because diversity is measured from the date on which suit is filed; a later move is irrelevant. B is correct (but sneaky) because the statute requires that the amount in controversy <i>exceed</i> $75,000. C is correct because the presence of a New York party on both sides of the suit violates the complete diversity rule.</p>

A is correct because there is no diversity and the claim (as opposed to the defense) does not arise under federal law. B is wrong because the lack of federal subject matter jurisdiction is not waived (Rule 12(h)(3)). C is correct (12(h)(3)). D is wrong because several cases have held that even a party who invoked the court’s subject matter jurisdiction can thereafter challenge it. <i>Capron v. Van Noorden</i>, supra page 217.</p>

A is wrong because removal is possible only if there would have been original jurisdiction; here there is no federal claim and no diversity—thus no removal. B is wrong because, although there is diversity, a home-state defendant cannot remove. C is correct because the antitrust claim is federal, and thus removable. D is correct because both diversity and the amount in controversy requirements are met and the out-of-state defendant seeks to remove.</p>

B is correct because the claim against Catherine does not arise under federal law and there’s no diversity. C is correct because this dispute apparently involves both the employer (who has lost Ben as an employee) and the lurer-away (Catherine), whose actions induced Ben to breach the contract. D is correct because even though the claim against Catherine involves the same constitutional case or controversy, 28 U.S.C. §1367(b) does not permit supplemental jurisdiction to extend to claims by plaintiffs against nondiverse parties joined under Rule 20 when the only basis for jurisdiction is diversity.</p>

<p id="c09cc4d1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recall the theme of this section—the constitutional framework for U.S. litigation. The two preceding chapters have illustrated the two principal means by which the Constitution creates that framework: It limits the powers of states over defendants, and it enumerates (thereby limiting) the powers of the federal courts. The first limitation appears in the doctrines of personal jurisdiction, the second in those of federal subject matter jurisdiction. The Constitution thus requires state courts to share power with one another and with a federal judiciary. This chapter explores an entailment of that shared power: How does the Constitution ensure that these two court systems respect each other’s spheres of power?</p>
<p id="c09cc4d2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question arises because state and federal courts not only share power, but they exercise overlapping jurisdiction. For example, under modern understandings of personal jurisdiction, several different states—and the state and federal courts in those states—may have jurisdiction to hear a case against a particular defendant. Similarly, state courts can hear cases arising under federal law, and federal courts, sitting in diversity, can hear cases that arise under state law. Under these circumstances both state and federal courts frequently face a question that arises from this overlapping jurisdiction: What law applies to the case before us?</p>
<p id="c09cc4d3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="256" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page256">p. 256</span>Consider a fairly simple case: Al (from Arizona) sues Barb (from Texas) on a claim for an allegedly unpaid loan for $100,000; Barb has substantial contacts with Arizona, so she could be sued in a state court either there or in Texas. Moreover, as you have seen in the preceding chapter, the case would also fall under the diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts and so could be filed in federal courts in Arizona and Texas. Suppose that Barb asserts as a defense that the loan violated the lending laws of Texas. Whose law would apply?</p>
<p id="c09cc4d4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This question would arise in whichever court heard the case, and it opens a broad field of inquiry known as <i>choice of law</i> or <i>conflict of laws. Erie</i>, an opinion from which this chapter takes its title, involves a subset of these questions: When a federal court sits in diversity jurisdiction or exercises supplemental jurisdiction, what law does it apply?</p>
<p id="c09cc4d5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This question, though phrased narrowly, opens the door onto a much larger set of questions about the relations of state and federal courts and of constitutional interpretation. Speaking about part of this problem, one distinguished commentator has written, “No issue in the whole field of federal jurisprudence has been more difficult.  . . . ” Wright, Federal Courts 368. This chapter will seek to explain why someone might take that view—but it also seeks to make the problems much less difficult than this quotation implies.</p>

<p id="c09cebea-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To understand how the issue arises, one needs a brief historical perspective. The first Judiciary Act provided for federal diversity jurisdiction and also contained a section now codified at 28 U.S.C. §1652 and known as the Rules of Decision Act:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c09cebeb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The laws of the several states, except where the Constitution or Acts of Congress ­otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decisions in civil actions in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply.</p>
</div>
<p id="c09cebec-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On its face, one might think that that statute, in effect since the earliest days of the Republic, would resolve the question. Since diversity cases are in federal court only because of the parties’ citizenship, there isn’t any federal law to apply, so one might think that such cases would be “cases where they [i.e., state laws] apply.” The story is not that simple, however, because people have disagreed sharply about what “the laws of the several states” means, and beyond that what “law” means.</p>
<p id="c09cebed-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These issues emerged in Swift v. Tyson, 41 U.S. 1 (1842), the leading pre-<i>Erie</i> case, which <i>Erie</i> overrules. <i>Swift</i> involved a “bill of exchange,” a halfway step between a promissory note and a modern check or credit card. With promissory <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="257" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page257">p. 257</span>notes, there are numerous defenses available to anyone sued for breach; with their modern analogues those defenses are much more limited. The substantive issue in <i>Swift</i> was how many defenses could be asserted and thus how much like an ordinary contract and how much like a modern check or credit card the bill of exchange was. Procedurally and jurisprudentially (the aspects with which we shall be concerned), the issue was which law applied to the substantive question. <i>Swift</i> was a diversity case filed in a federal court sitting in New York. New York courts had previously spoken on the substantive issue, ruling that bills were subject to a number of defenses. Were these New York cases part of “the laws” of that state and thus binding on the federal district court? No, held the U.S. Supreme Court in an opinion by Justice Joseph Story, who not only served on the U.S. Supreme Court from 1811-1845 but also taught law and wrote nine influential treatises—all while serving on the Court!</p>
<p id="c09cebee-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Story’s opinion, which, according to the dissent, reached beyond what was necessary for the decision, said that the New York precedents were not “laws”; thus, the federal courts sitting in diversity were free to ignore them:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c09cebef-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But, admitting the doctrine [concerning which defenses could be asserted] to be fully settled in New York, it remains to be considered whether it is obligatory upon this court if it differs from the principles established in the general commercial law. It is observable that the Courts of New York do not found their decisions upon this point upon any local statute, or positive, fixed, or ancient usage; but they deduce the doctrine from the general principles of commercial law. It is, however, contended that [the Rules of Decision Act] furnishes a rule obligatory on this Court to follow the decisions of state tribunals in all cases to which they apply. . . . In order to maintain the argument, it is essential. . . . that the word “laws” [in the Rules of Decision Act] includes within the scope of its meaning the decisions of local tribunals. In the ordinary use of language it will hardly be contended that the decisions of Courts constitute laws. They are at most evidence of what the laws are; and are not themselves laws. . . . The laws of a state are more usually understood to mean the rules and enactments promulgated by the legislative authority thereof. . . . [The Court said it would be bound by state statutes and by state judge-made law on matters of peculiarly “local” matters but not on more general topics.] Undoubtedly, the decisions of the local tribunals upon such subjects are entitled to, and will receive, the most deliberate attention and respect of this Court; but they cannot furnish positive rules on conclusive authority. . . . </p>
</div>
<p id="c09cebf0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Swift</i> went on to reach a conclusion different from that reached by the New York courts on the issue at stake.</p>
<p id="c09cebf1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the ensuing century, <i>Swift</i> came to be seen by many not only as momentous, but also as pernicious, not because of its holding on the negotiability of bills of exchange, but because of its treatment of state law. For many federal courts, <i>Swift</i> became a charter of judicial independence, a declaration that they could ignore state case law. Often decisions in the <i>Swift</i> line of cases seemed to favor business interests; one elaborate study argued, “As the number of industrial tort suits continued to increase [from the 1890s on] and Americans endured the most severe depression <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="258" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page258">p. 258</span>in their nation’s history, the Supreme Court [used diversity jurisdiction to] shape[] law in ways that enhanced the litigation position of corporate defendants.” Edward A. Purcell, Jr., Litigation and Inequality: Federal Diversity Jurisdiction in Industrial America, 1870-1958, 245 (Oxford 1992).</p>
<p id="c09d1302-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notice that <i>Swift</i> reached its conclusion as an interpretation of the Rules of Decision Act, which Congress could have amended during the years that followed. Congress did not amend the Act. The next step in the story took matters out of Congress’s hands.</p>

<p id="c09d1305-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Erie</i> doctrine arose from a relatively simple dispute. On Thursday, July 26, 1934, Harry Tompkins visited his mother-in-law’s house in Hughestown, a village of 2,800 people in northeastern Pennsylvania. He received a ride part of the way home and walked the remaining distance along the railroad tracks of the Erie Railroad, keeping several feet between himself and the tracks. A train passed, and an open door on a refrigerator car struck him and knocked him partially under the train. His right arm was severed. After recovering from his injuries, he sought a lawyer and found 27-year-old Bernard Nemeroff. Although <i>Swift v. Tyson</i> was generally understood to benefit corporations, in this case, Nemeroff and his partner, 21-year-old Aaron Danzig, believed that they could turn <i>Swift</i> to Tompkins’s strategic advantage if they sued the railroad in the federal District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>
<p id="c09d1306-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under Pennsylvania law, for whose application the railroad’s lawyer argued, Tompkins was a trespasser and the railroad was therefore liable only for “wanton” negligence, a finding unlikely given the facts. The judge, relying on the freedom given by <i>Swift v. Tyson</i>, instead instructed the jury according to the “general law,” that the railroad was liable even if it was guilty of only “ordinary” negligence. The jury returned a verdict for Tompkins in the amount of $30,000 (almost $500,000 in 2019 dollars). The railroad appealed, but the Second Circuit upheld Tompkins’s verdict relying on <i>Swift v. Tyson</i>. The railroad then sought a writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court. In the meantime the railroad asked Justice Cardozo to stay the judgment until the Supreme Court could consider the certiorari petition, and Justice Cardozo obliged. The railroad then made Tompkins a settlement offer—$7,500 plus the withdrawal of its certiorari petition—but Danzig and Nemeroff talked him out of accepting and then hid him from the railroad’s lawyers.</p>
<p id="c09d1307-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court granted certiorari, even though it rarely did so in negligence cases. On April 25, 1938, the Supreme Court decided the case in one of the last opinions written by Justice Brandeis. The decision went unnoticed until Justice Stone wrote privately to a <i>New York Times</i> journalist, calling to his attention “the most important opinion since I have been on the court.”</p>

<p id="c09d3a1d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Louis D. Brandeis is remembered as much for his career before appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court as for his work as a Justice. Successful both as a law reformer and as a private practitioner, Brandeis liked to describe himself as “counsel to the situation,” a concept that has drawn both high praise for the idea of the lawyer as problem-solver, and criticism for its suggestion that he was prepared to lay aside the interests of some clients to pursue his own idea of justice. Indeed, some of those on the losing side of Brandeis’s legal practice bitterly opposed his nomination by President Wilson to the Supreme Court, and six months of wrangling preceded his confirmation in 1916. Best known during his life for cases upholding social legislation, Brandeis wrote <i>Erie</i> as one of his last opinions for the Court. In rejecting a statutory basis for the holding in <i>Erie</i>, Brandeis departed from a general principle he otherwise espoused—deciding cases on non-constitutional grounds if possible, a principle that has come to be known as “the <i>Ashwander</i> principle,” after Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 297 U.S. 288 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).</p>

But it was the more recent research of a competent scholar, who examined the original document, which established that the construction given to it by the Court was erroneous; and that the purpose of the section was merely to make certain that, in all matters except those in which some federal law is controlling, the federal courts exercising jurisdiction in diversity of citizenship cases would apply as their rules of decision the law of the State, unwritten as well as written.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1013D_d543b178-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N1013D_d543b178-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">5</a></span></p>
<p id="c09d6139-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Criticism of the doctrine became widespread after the decision of <i>Black &amp; White Taxicab Co. v. Brown &amp; Yellow Taxicab Co</i>. There, Brown and Yellow, a Kentucky corporation owned by Kentuckians, and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, also a Kentucky corporation, wished that the former should have the exclusive privilege of soliciting passenger and baggage transportation at the Bowling Green, Kentucky, railroad station; and that the Black and White, a competing Kentucky corporation, should be prevented from interfering with that privilege. Knowing that such a contract would be void under the common law of Kentucky, it was arranged that the Brown and Yellow reincorporate under the law of Tennessee, and that the contract with the railroad should be executed there. The suit was then brought by the Tennessee corporation in the federal court for Western Kentucky to enjoin competition by the Black and White; an injunction issued by the District Court was sustained by the Court of Appeals; and this Court, citing many decisions in which the doctrine of <i>Swift v. Tyson</i> had been applied, affirmed the decree.</p>
<p id="c09d613a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Second</i>. Experience in applying the doctrine of <i>Swift v. Tyson</i> had revealed its defects, political and social; and the benefits expected to flow from the rule did not accrue. Persistence of state courts in their own opinions on questions of common law prevented uniformity; and the impossibility of discovering a satisfactory line of demarcation between the province of general law and that of local law developed a new well of uncertainties.</p>
<p id="c09d613b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, the mischievous results of the doctrine had become apparent. Diversity of citizenship jurisdiction was conferred in order to prevent apprehended <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="261" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page261">p. 261</span>discrimination in State courts against those not citizens of the State. <i>Swift v. Tyson</i> introduced grave discrimination by non-citizens against citizens. It made rights enjoyed under the unwritten “general law” vary according to whether enforcement was sought in the state or in the federal court; and the privilege of selecting the court in which the right should be determined was conferred upon the non-citizen. Thus, the doctrine rendered impossible equal protection of the law. In attempting to promote uniformity of law throughout the United States, the doctrine had prevented uniformity in the administration of the law of the State.</p>
<p id="c09d613c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The discrimination resulting became in practice far-reaching. This resulted in part from the broad province accorded to the so-called “general law” as to which federal courts exercised an independent judgment. [The opinion cited many fields of law.]</p>
<p id="c09d613d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In part the discrimination resulted from the wide range of persons held entitled to avail themselves of the federal rule by resort to the diversity of citizenship jurisdiction. . . . </p>
<p id="c09d613e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The injustice and confusion incident to the doctrine of <i>Swift v. Tyson</i> have been repeatedly urged as reasons for abolishing or limiting diversity of citizenship jurisdiction. Other legislative relief has been proposed. If only a question of statutory construction were involved, we should not be prepared to abandon a doctrine so widely applied throughout nearly a century. But the unconstitutionality of the course pursued has now been made clear and compels us to do so.</p>
<p id="c09d613f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Third.</i> Except in matters governed by the Federal Constitution or by Acts of Congress, the law to be applied in any case is the law of the State. And whether the law of the State shall be declared by its Legislature in a statute or by its highest court in a decision is not a matter of federal concern. There is no federal general common law. Congress has no power to declare substantive rules of common law applicable in a State whether they be local in their nature or “general,” be they commercial law or a part of the law of torts. And no clause in the Constitution purports to confer such a power upon the federal courts. As stated by Mr. Justice Field when protesting in Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R. Co. v. Baugh, 149 U.S. 368, 401, against ignoring the Ohio common law of fellow-servant liability: “[N]otwithstanding the frequency with which the doctrine [of <i>Swift v. Tyson</i>] has been reiterated, there stands, as a perpetual protest against its repetition, the constitution of the United States, which recognizes and preserves the autonomy and independence of the states,—independence in their legislative and independence in their judicial departments. Supervision over either the legislative or the judicial action of the states is in no case permissible except as to matters by the constitution specifically authorized or delegated to the United States. Any interference with either, except as thus permitted, is an invasion of the authority of the state, and, to that extent, a denial of its independence.”</p>
<p id="c09d6140-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The fallacy underlying the rule declared in <i>Swift v. Tyson</i> is made clear by Mr. Justice Holmes. The doctrine rests upon the assumption that there is “a transcendental body of law outside of any particular State but obligatory within it unless and until changed by statute,” that federal courts have the power to use their judgment as to what the rules of common law are; and that in the federal courts “the parties are entitled to an independent judgment on matters of general law”:</p>

</div>
<p id="c09d6142-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus the doctrine of <i>Swift v. Tyson</i> is, as Mr. Justice Holmes said, “an unconstitutional assumption of powers by courts of the United States which no lapse of time or respectable array of opinion should make us hesitate to correct.” In disapproving that doctrine we do not hold unconstitutional §34 of the Federal Judiciary Act of 1789 or any other Act of Congress. We merely declare that in applying the doctrine this Court and the lower courts have invaded rights which in our opinion are reserved by the Constitution to the several States.</p>
<p id="c09d6143-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Fourth</i>. The defendant contended that by the common law of Pennsylvania as declared by its highest court in Falchetti v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 160 A. 859, the only duty owed to the plaintiff was to refrain from willful or wanton injury. The plaintiff denied that such is the Pennsylvania law. In support of their respective contentions the parties discussed and cited many decisions of the Supreme Court of the State. The Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the question of liability is one of general law; and on that ground declined to decide the issue of state law. As we hold this was error, the judgment is reversed and the case remanded to it for further proceedings in conformity with our opinion.</p>

<p id="c09d6148-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The “unconstitutional” course referred to in the majority opinion is apparently the ruling in <i>Swift v. Tyson</i> that the supposed omission of Congress to legislate as to the effect of decisions leaves federal courts free to interpret general law for themselves. I am not at all sure whether, in the absence of federal statutory direction, federal courts would be compelled to follow state decisions. There was sufficient doubt about the matter in 1789 to induce the first Congress to legislate. . . . If the opinion commits this Court to the position that the Congress is without power to declare what rules of substantive law shall govern the federal courts, that conclusion also seems questionable. The line between procedural and substantive law is hazy but no one doubts federal power over procedure. The Judiciary Article and the “necessary and proper” clause of Article One may fully authorize legislation, such as this section of the Judiciary Act.</p>

And whether the law of the State shall be declared by its Legislature in a statute or by its highest court in a decision is not a matter of federal concern.” Do those sentences, which some have described as “structural federalism,” explain how the decision has constitutional roots? The generally accepted answer is that respect for states includes respect for a state’s decision to give part of its lawmaking powers to courts rather than to legislatures. If a state is content to have its judges make some of its laws in the process of adjudicating cases, the federal government—including federal courts—must respect that decision. Those propositions, the argument continues, are inherent in <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="264" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page264">p. 264</span>the federal structure of government, a structure expressed throughout the Constitution, and incorporated by allusion in the Tenth Amendment (since the Constitution did not strip the state courts of lawmaking powers, they retain them).

<p id="c09d886b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Erie</i> says that “there is no federal general common law.” One can easily understand this sentence to mean more than it does. <i>Erie</i> holds only that “<i>general</i>” federal common law may not displace that of the states in areas in which the Constitution rests lawmaking power in the states. But—confined to its proper sphere, federal common law continues to flourish: Think of the hundreds of federal causes of action, in which courts must supplement general statutory or constitutional principles with judge-made common law. For example, Congress granted federal jurisdiction over a broad area of labor law—without providing any guiding substantive principles. The Court held that Congress thereby intended to give federal courts common law powers in this area. Textile Workers Union of America v. Lincoln Mills, 353 U.S. 448 (1957). In other fields both state and federal courts rely almost entirely on common law. For example, both state and federal courts consult common law to decide on the principles of former adjudication, which you will study in Chapter 11.</p>
<p id="c09d886c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In diversity cases, it will be clear that the only source of substantive law must be that of the states, and <i>Erie</i> commands federal courts to respect that law, whether made by <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="265" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page265">p. 265</span>legislatures or courts. But the <i>Erie</i> principle will also apply whenever states supply the governing law, regardless of the basis for federal subject matter jurisdiction. For example, suppose a federal civil rights claim of employment discrimination is brought in federal district court, with additional state law claims for breach of contract and state employment statutes, brought under the federal supplemental jurisdiction statute explored in Chapter 3. There’s no diversity in sight, but the principles of <i>Erie</i> still apply: The federal courts will look to state law, including state common law, in deciding the state law claims.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c09daf89-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Much of the Court’s discussion in <i>Erie</i> is devoted to the evils of forum shopping. By “forum shopping” the Court seems to mean the practice of a litigant’s selecting one rather than another court in which to sue, in the hope that the court will in some way treat the litigant more favorably than another court that might have heard the case. For example, under <i>Swift v. Tyson</i> there were several circumstances in which federal courts would enforce contracts that state courts would have refused to enforce. In such an instance, a plaintiff hoping to enforce such an agreement would “shop” for a forum (in this case the federal courts) that would enforce it.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c09daf8b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What’s wrong with forum shopping? <i>Erie</i> seems to assume that forum shopping between state and federal courts is the major problem. At the time of <i>Erie</i>, Tompkins could have sued the railroad in Pennsylvania, in New York, and perhaps in several other states where it did business; each of those states would likely have taken a slightly different approach to his case. Seven years after <i>Erie</i>, the Court decided <i>International Shoe</i>, thus giving its constitutional blessing to an extended jurisdictional reach for state courts. With this extension, plaintiffs will often have a choice of several different states in which to sue a defendant, and those states may have different substantive laws. Moreover, the parties’ lawyers have a duty to their clients to find the forum most advantageous to them. So, one might understand <i>Erie</i> not as a demonization of forum shopping, but as a limitation on the power of federal courts to decide the law applicable to state law disputes.</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c09daf8c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Erie</i> was the first civil case heard by Judge Mandelbaum, the trial judge. Judge Mandelbaum was a product of New York machine politics and, over strong protest from the bar, was appointed to the bench by President Roosevelt. Before his appointment, Mandelbaum had visited the federal courthouse only once, to see what it looked like. His notes, penned in the margin of his copy of the Supreme Court’s <i>Erie</i> opinion and reported in Irving Younger, <i>Observation: What Happened in</i> Erie, 56 Tex. L. Rev. 1011, 1030 (1978), suggest a different perspective on the case: “Because the <i>Swift Tyson</i> case[,] although before this case I never knew of its existence to be truthful[,] and for the confusion this decision brought about, it might have been better to leave it alone and stand by good old Swifty.”</p></li>

<p id="c09daf90-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Erie</i>—decided in 1938—changed the way federal courts thought about judge-made law. The same year brought another, even bigger, change: 1938 was the year in which the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure became effective. As you will see throughout this course, those rules transformed procedure in many ways. You may have wondered what procedures the federal courts followed before the Rules. The answer comes in two tiers. A federal statute, known as the Conformity Act, ordered the federal courts to follow whatever procedural rules existed in the state where the federal court sat. So a federal court in New York would follow New York procedural rules and a federal court in California would follow that state’s procedural regime<i>—mostly</i>. It’s “mostly” because alongside the state procedures decreed by the Conformity Act existed a separate set of rules for the federal courts when they were “sitting in equity"—considering whether to order an injunction or establish a receivership, to use two common examples. These separate equity rules were necessary because not all state courts had equitable jurisdiction. The Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. §2072, which empowered the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, also repealed the Conformity Act and “merged” law and equity, making separate equity rules unnecessary. And—that same year saw <i>Erie</i>, which overruled <i>Swift v. Tyson</i> and the regime it represented. One imagines a lot of lawyers staying up late on many nights trying to understand the brave new world they had entered.</p>

<p id="c09dd6a3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having struggled with the constitutional ambiguities, you may be distressed to learn that, constitutional basis aside, <i>Erie</i> was an easy case for the application of the principle it announced. The remainder of this chapter will consider decisions in which the issue is how to apply the <i>Erie</i> doctrine—decisions that require a more subtle look at what that case held.</p>
<p id="c09dd6a4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Erie</i> established that federal courts sitting in diversity (or exercising supplemental jurisdiction) were bound to replicate state practice in some circumstances. Which circumstances? Though <i>Erie</i> did not say so, its setting suggested that at the very least federal courts sitting in diversity or exercising supplemental jurisdiction should observe state substantive law, whether made by legislatures or by courts. But what about other “laws"? For example, were federal courts sitting in diversity bound to apply state statutes of limitations? If the courts of the state in question did not generally enforce arbitration agreements, could federal courts nevertheless do so if authorized by a federal statute? If a suit in state court could <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="268" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page268">p. 268</span>be decided only by a judge, was a federal court precluded from using a jury? If a state statute required personal service of process, did that requirement also apply to process served in a federal diversity action? If a state court were bound to refuse to honor a contractual forum selection clause, were federal courts sitting in that state required to do likewise? If a state legislature orders its appellate courts to reduce excessive damages awarded by juries, does a federal appellate court have the same power?</p>
<p id="c09dd6a5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the years since <i>Erie</i>, the Supreme Court has addressed each of these questions (as well as others) in an effort to mediate between opposing principles: that <i>Erie</i> requires deference to state courts as lawmaking bodies; and that federal courts are an independent judicial system. Justice Reed’s concurrence in <i>Erie</i> raised but did not resolve the question: “The line between procedural and substantive law is hazy, but no one doubts federal power over procedure.” Notice that many of these questions involve issues that could be described as “procedural.” As you read the next cases, consider whether it is true that “no one doubts” federal power over procedure.</p>

<p id="c09dd6ad-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Plaintiffs sued a bond trustee in a federal diversity action alleging misrepresentation and breach of trust. New York substantive law governed. Defendant invoked the New York statute of limitations, which had run. Plaintiffs argued that the statute of limitations did not bar the suit because it was on the “equity side” of federal court. The courts of equity had traditionally considered the length of time elapsing between the maturing of a claim and the bringing of suit but had not thought themselves strictly bound by statutes of limitations. Referring to that equitable tradition, the Second Circuit ruled that plaintiffs’ suit was not barred. The Supreme Court disagreed.]</p>
<p id="c09dd6ae-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our starting point must be the policy of federal jurisdiction which <i>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins</i> embodies. In overruling <i>Swift v. Tyson</i>, <i>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins</i> did not merely overrule a venerable case. It overruled a particular way of looking at law which dominated the judicial process long after its inadequacies had been laid bare. Law was conceived as a “brooding omnipresence” of Reason, of which decisions were merely evidence and not themselves the controlling formulations. Accordingly, federal courts deemed themselves free to ascertain what Reason, and therefore Law, required wholly independent of authoritatively declared State law, even in cases where a legal right as the basis for relief was created by State authority and could not be created by federal authority and the case got into a federal court merely because it was “between Citizens of different States” under Art. III, §2 of the Constitution of the United States. . . . </p>
<p id="c09dfdbf-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="269" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page269">p. 269</span>This case reduces itself to the narrow question whether, when no recovery could be had in a State court because the action is barred by the statute of limitations, a federal court in equity can take cognizance of the suit because there is diversity of citizenship between the parties. . . . </p>
<p id="c09dfdc0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And so the question is not whether a statute of limitations is deemed a matter of “procedure” in some sense. The question is whether such a statute concerns merely the manner and the means by which a right to recover, as recognized by the State, is enforced, or whether such statutory limitation is a matter of substance in the aspect that alone is relevant to our problem, namely, does it significantly affect the result of a litigation for a federal court to disregard a law of a State that would be controlling in an action upon the same claim by the same parties in a State court?</p>
<p id="c09dfdc1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is therefore immaterial whether statutes of limitation are characterized either as “substantive” or “procedural” in State court opinions in any use of those terms unrelated to the specific issue before us. <i>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins</i> was not an endeavor to formulate scientific legal terminology. It expressed a policy that touches vitally the proper distribution of judicial power between State and federal courts. In essence, the intent of that decision was to insure that, in all cases where a federal court is exercising jurisdiction solely because of the diversity of citizenship of the parties, the outcome of the litigation in the federal court should be substantially the same, so far as legal rules determine the outcome of a litigation, as it would be if tried in a State court. . . . </p>

<li class=""><p id="c09dfdc9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even in the midst of this attack, however, Justice Frankfurter conceded that federal courts need not follow state law that “concern[ed] merely the manner and means by which a right to recover is. . . . enforced.” Isn’t this conceding that Justice Reed was right?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c09dfdca-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As you read the rest of the cases in the <i>Erie</i> line, consider whether they don’t come down to the question of defining “the manner and means by which a right to recover is. . . . enforced.” (A procedure casebook can be excused for omitting “merely” from the phrase.)</p></li>

What does that mean? The standard paper sizes are 8 1/2” × 11” and 8 1/2” × 14". If a litigant offered the clerk of a federal district court a complaint typed on 8 1/2 × 14-inch paper, but the clerk refused to accept it on the grounds that the rules required shorter paper and the filing cabinets couldn’t hold paper 14 inches long, would you call the rule invoked by the clerk substantive because it was outcome-determinative? After all, the plaintiff might very well win in state court but can hardly win in federal court if the complaint can’t be filed. If you conclude that the “paper size” rule is not substantive for <i>Erie</i> purposes, how would you modify the outcome-determinative rule to exclude cases of this sort?</p></li>

Tyson</i>. <i>Erie</i> and <i>Guaranty Trust</i> asserted that such a view was not only jurisprudentially bankrupt but historically false—that the understanding of the Rules of Decision Act held by its framers was in accordance with that enunciated by <i>Guaranty Trust</i> and <i>Erie</i>. That understanding exercised a powerful influence over the <i>Erie</i> line of cases following <i>Guaranty Trust.</i> Consider four such cases.</p>

<p id="c09e7220-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The respondent argues that this state-court decision governs the present diversity case and “divests the jury of its normal function” to decide the disputed fact question of the respondent’s immunity under §72-111. This is to contend that the federal court is bound under <i>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins</i> to follow the state court’s holding to secure uniform enforcement of the immunity created by the State.</p>
<p id="c09e7221-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>First</i>. It was decided in <i>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins</i> that the federal courts in diversity cases must respect the definition of state-created rights and obligations by the state courts. We must, therefore, first examine the rule in <i>Adams v. Davison-Paxon Co</i>. to determine whether it is bound up with these rights and obligations in such a way that its application in the federal court is required.</p>
<p id="c09e7222-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Workmen’s Compensation Act is administered in South Carolina by its Industrial Commission. The South Carolina courts hold that, on judicial review of actions of the Commission under §72-111, the question whether the claim of an <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="273" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page273">p. 273</span>injured workman is within the Commission’s jurisdiction is a matter of law for decision by the court, which makes its own findings of fact relating to that jurisdiction. The South Carolina Supreme Court states no reasons in <i>Adams v. Davison-Paxon Co</i>. why, although the jury decides all other factual issues raised by the cause of action and defenses, the jury is displaced as to the factual issue raised by the affirmative defense under §72-111. . . . We find nothing to suggest that this rule was announced as an integral part of the special relationship created by the statute. Thus the requirement appears to be merely a form and mode of enforcing the immunity, <i>Guaranty Trust Co. v. York</i>, and not a rule intended to be bound up with the definition of the rights and obligations of the parties. . . . </p>
<p id="c09e7223-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Second</i>. But cases following <i>Erie</i> have evinced a broader policy to the effect that the federal courts should conform as near as may be—in the absence of other considerations—to state rules even of form and mode where the state rules may bear substantially on the question whether the litigation would come out one way in the federal court and another way in the state court if the federal court failed to apply a particular local rule. E.g., <i>Guaranty Trust Co. v. York</i>; <i>Bernhardt v. Polygraphic Co</i>. Concededly the nature of the tribunal which tries issues may be important in the enforcement of the parcel of rights making up a cause of action or defense, and bear significantly upon achievement of uniform enforcement of the right. It may well be that in the instant personal-injury case the outcome would be substantially affected by whether the issue of immunity is decided by a judge or a jury. Therefore, were “outcome” the only consideration, a strong case might appear for saying that the federal court should follow the state practice.</p>
<p id="c09e7224-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But there are affirmative countervailing considerations at work here. The federal system is an independent system for administering justice to litigants who properly invoke its jurisdiction. An essential characteristic of that system is the manner in which, in civil common-law actions, it distributes trial functions between judge and jury and, under the influence—if not the command<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1057B_d543b178-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N1057B_d543b178-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">10</a></span>—of the Seventh Amendment, assigns the decisions of disputed questions of fact to the jury. The policy of uniform enforcement of state-created rights and obligations, see, e.g., <i>Guaranty Trust Co. v. York</i>, supra, cannot in every case exact compliance with a state rule<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10584_d543b178-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10584_d543b178-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">12</a></span>—not bound up with rights and obligations—which disrupts the federal system of allocating functions between judge and jury. Thus the inquiry here is whether the federal policy favoring jury decisions of disputed fact questions should yield to the state rule in the interest of furthering the objective that the litigation should not come out one way in the federal court and another way in the state court.</p>
<p id="c09e9937-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="274" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page274">p. 274</span>We think that in the circumstances of this case the federal court should not follow the state rule. It cannot be gainsaid that there is a strong federal policy against allowing state rules to disrupt the judge-jury relationship in the federal courts. . . . Perhaps even more clearly in light of the influence of the Seventh Amendment, the function assigned to the jury “is an essential factor in the process for which the­ ­Federal Constitution provides.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c09e9938-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Third</i>. We have discussed the problem upon the assumption that the outcome of the litigation may be substantially affected by whether the issue of immunity is decided by a judge or a jury. But clearly there is not present here the certainty that a different result would follow, cf. <i>Guaranty Trust Co. v. York</i>, supra, or even the strong possibility that this would be the case. There are factors present here which might reduce that possibility. The trial judge in the federal system has powers denied the judges of many States to comment on the weight of evidence and credibility of witnesses, and discretion to grant a new trial if the verdict appears to him to be against the weight of the evidence. We do not think the likelihood of a different result is so strong as to require the federal practice of jury determination of disputed factual issues to yield to the state rule in the interest of uniformity of outcome. . . . </p>

<p id="c09ec058-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The case arose out of a diversity suit for personal injuries. The defendant was the estate of one of the drivers involved. The issue arose because Massachusetts law provided that suits against an estate required personal service of process on the estate’s executor. Process was instead served under Rule 4[(e)(2)(B)], which allowed for the summons and complaint to be left with a competent adult at the residence of any defendant. Defendant was served by leaving the summons and complaint with his wife at his residence. The district court and First Circuit, citing <i>Ragan</i> (see the chart in Note 3 supra page 270), ruled that the claim should be dismissed because plaintiff had failed to comply with the state method of serving process within the applicable statute of limitations.]</p>
<p id="c09ec059-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that the adoption of Rule 4[(e)(2)(B)], designed to control service of process in diversity actions, neither exceeded the congressional mandate embodied in the Rules Enabling Act nor transgressed constitutional bounds, and that the Rule is therefore the standard against which the District Court should have measured the adequacy of the service.

<p id="c09ee76e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the cases construing the scope of the Enabling Act, Rule 4[(e)(2)(B)] clearly passes muster. Prescribing the manner in which a defendant is to be notified that a suit has been instituted against him, it relates to the “practice and procedure of the district courts.” “The test must be whether a rule really regulates procedure—the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for disregard or infraction of them.” <i>Sibbach v. Wilson &amp; Co</i>. . . . </p>
<p id="c09ee76f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, were there no conflicting state procedure, Rule 4[(e)(2)(B)] would clearly control. However, respondent, focusing on the contrary Massachusetts rule, calls to the Court’s attention another line of cases, a line which—like the Federal Rules—had its birth in 1938. <i>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins</i>, overruling <i>Swift v. Tyson</i>, held that federal courts sitting in diversity cases, when deciding questions of “substantive” law, are <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="276" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page276">p. 276</span>bound by state court decisions as well as state statutes. The broad command of <i>Erie</i> was therefore identical to that of the Enabling Act: federal courts are to apply state substantive law and federal procedural law. However, as subsequent cases sharpened the distinction between substance and procedure, the line of cases following <i>Erie</i> diverged markedly from the line construing the Enabling Act. . . . </p>
<p id="c09ee770-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent, by placing primary reliance on <i>York</i> and <i>Ragan</i>, suggests that the <i>Erie</i> doctrine acts as a check on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, that despite the clear command of Rule 4[(e)(2)(B)], <i>Erie</i> and its progeny demand the application of the Massachusetts rule. . . . </p>
<p id="c09ee771-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the first place, it is doubtful that, even if there were no Federal Rule making it clear that in-hand service is not required in diversity actions, the <i>Erie</i> rule would have obligated the District Court to follow the Massachusetts procedure. “Outcome-determination” analysis was never intended to serve as a talisman. <i>Byrd v. Blue Ridge Cooperative</i>. Indeed, the message of <i>York</i> itself is that choices between state and federal law are to be made not by application of any automatic, “litmus paper” criterion, but rather by reference to the policies underlying the <i>Erie</i> rule.</p>
<p id="c09ee772-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Erie</i> rule is rooted in part in a realization that it would be unfair for the character or result of a litigation materially to differ because the suit had been brought in a federal court. . . . The decision was also in part a reaction to the practice of “forum-shopping” which had grown up in response to the rule of <i>Swift v. Tyson</i>. That the <i>York</i> test was an attempt to effectuate these policies is demonstrated by the fact that the opinion framed the inquiry in terms of “substantial” variations between state and federal litigation. Not only are nonsubstantial, or trivial, variations not likely to raise the sort of constitutional problems which troubled the Court in <i>Erie</i>; they are also unlikely to influence the choice of a forum. The “outcome-determination” test therefore cannot be read without reference to the twin aims of the <i>Erie</i> rule: discouragement of forum-shopping and avoidance of inequitable administration of the laws.</p>
<p id="c09ee773-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The difference between the conclusion that the Massachusetts rule is applicable, and the conclusion that it is not, is of course at this point “outcome-determinative” in the sense that if we hold the state rule to apply, respondent prevails, whereas if we hold that Rule 4[(e)(2)(B)] governs, the litigation will continue. But in this sense <i>every</i> procedural variation is “outcome-determinative.. . . . [I]t is difficult to argue that permitting service of defendant’s wife to take the place of in-hand service of defendant himself alters the mode of enforcement of state-created rights in a fashion sufficiently “substantial” to raise the sort of equal protection problems to which the <i>Erie</i> opinion alluded.</p>
<p id="c09ee774-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is, however, a more fundamental flaw in respondent’s syllogism: the incorrect assumption that the rule of <i>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins</i> constitutes the appropriate test of the validity and therefore the applicability of a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. The <i>Erie</i> rule has never been invoked to void a Federal Rule. It is true that there have been cases where this Court has held applicable a state rule in the face of an argument that the situation was governed by one of the Federal Rules. But the holding of each such case was not that <i>Erie</i> commanded displacement of a Federal Rule by an inconsistent state rule, but rather that the scope of the Federal Rule was not as broad as the losing party urged, and therefore, there being no Federal Rule which covered the point in dispute, <i>Erie</i> commanded the enforcement of state law. . . . (Here, of course, the clash is unavoidable; Rule 4[(e)(2)(B)] says—implicitly, but with unmistakable clarity—that in-hand service is not required in federal courts.) At the same <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="277" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page277">p. 277</span>time, in cases adjudicating the validity of Federal Rules, we have not applied the <i>York</i> rule or other refinements of <i>Erie</i>, but have to this day continued to decide questions concerning the scope of the Enabling Act and the constitutionality of specific Federal Rules in light of the distinction set forth in <i>Sibbach</i>.</p>
<p id="c09ee775-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor has the development of two separate lines of cases been inadvertent. The line between “substance” and “procedure” shifts as the legal context changes. . . . It is true that both the Enabling Act and the <i>Erie</i> rule say, roughly, that federal courts are to apply state “substantive” law and federal “procedural” law, but from that it need not follow that the tests are identical. For they were designed to control very different sorts of decisions. When a situation is covered by one of the Federal Rules, the question facing the court is a far cry from the typical, relatively unguided <i>Erie</i> choice: the court has been instructed to apply the Federal Rule, and can refuse to do so only if the Advisory Committee, this Court, and Congress erred in their prima facie judgment that the Rule in question transgresses neither the terms of the Enabling Act nor constitutional restrictions. . . . </p>
<p id="c09ee776-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Erie</i> and its offspring cast no doubt on the long-recognized power of Congress to prescribe housekeeping rules for federal courts even though some of those rules will inevitably differ from comparable state rules. . . . Thus, though a court, in measuring a Federal Rule against the standards contained in the Enabling Act and the Constitution, need not wholly blind itself to the degree to which the Rule makes the character and result of the federal litigation stray from the course it would follow in state courts, it cannot be forgotten that the <i>Erie</i> rule, and the guidelines suggested in <i>York</i>, were created to serve another purpose altogether. To hold that a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure must cease to function whenever it alters the mode of enforcing state-created rights would be to disembowel either the Constitution’s grant of power over federal procedure or Congress’ attempt to exercise that power in the Enabling Act. Rule 4[(e)(2)(B)] is valid and controls the instant case.</p>

I have always regarded that decision as one of the modern cornerstones of our federalism, expressing policies that profoundly touch the allocation of judicial power between the state and federal systems. <i>Erie</i> recognized that there should not be two conflicting systems of law controlling the primary activity of citizens, for such alternative governing authority must necessarily give rise to a debilitating uncertainty in the planning of everyday affairs.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN106EA_d543b178-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N106EA_d543b178-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">1</a></span> And it recognized that the scheme of our Constitution envisions an allocation of law-making functions between state and federal legislative processes which is undercut <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="278" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page278">p. 278</span>if the federal judiciary can make substantive law affecting state affairs beyond the bounds of congressional legislative powers in this regard. Thus, in diversity cases <i>Erie</i> commands that it be the state law governing primary private activity which prevails.</p>
<p id="c09f0e8c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The shorthand formulations which have appeared in some past decisions are prone to carry untoward results that frequently arise from oversimplification. . . . To my mind the proper line of approach in determining whether to apply a state or a federal rule, whether “substantive” or “procedural,” is to stay close to basic principles by inquiring if the choice of rule would substantially affect those primary decisions respecting human conduct which our constitutional system leaves to state regulation. If so, <i>Erie</i> and the Constitution require that the state rule prevail, even in the face of a conflicting federal rule.</p>
<p id="c09f0e8d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court weakens, if indeed it does not submerge, this basic principle by finding, in effect, a grant of substantive legislative power in the constitutional provision for a federal court system, and through it, setting up the Federal Rules as a body of law inviolate. . . . So long as a reasonable man could characterize any duly adopted federal rule as “procedural,” the Court, unless I misapprehend what is said, would have it apply no matter how seriously it frustrated a State’s substantive regulation of the primary conduct and affairs of its citizens. Since the members of the Advisory Committee, the Judicial Conference, and this Court who formulated the Federal Rules are presumably reasonable men, it follows that the integrity of the Federal Rules is absolute. Whereas the unadulterated outcome and forum-shopping tests may err too far toward honoring state rules, I submit that the Court’s “arguably procedural, ergo constitutional” test moves too fast and far in the other direction. . . . </p>

Moreover, both enunciate multi-tiered “tests” for determining whether federal or state practice should prevail.

<li class=""><p id="c09f35a7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Hanna</i> says that the analysis in that situation is relatively easy:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcroman">
<li class=""><p id="c09f35a8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is the statute or Rule constitutional? One can hear in this question an echo of <i>Erie</i> with its assertion that Congress could not constitutionally dictate tort law to the states. The converse proposition is that Congress can dictate rules of procedure to the federal courts it creates. If the Rule or statute is constitutional and tells a federal court to do something, the court must follow the provisions of that statute.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c09f35a9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At that point, the <i>Erie</i> issue ceases to be directly constitutional, becoming instead a matter of statutory construction: What does the governing statute tell the federal court to do? In the case of a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the analysis requires two steps, because the Rules are not themselves statutes but a delegation to the Supreme Court to make statute-like rules.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c09f35aa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Theoretically, one must consider whether the initial delegation (in the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. §2072) was constitutional; the few cases to consider the question have said it is. E.g., Sibbach v. Wilson, 312 U.S. 1 (1941).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c09f35ab-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One must then ask two questions.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-decimal">
<li class=""><p id="c09f35ac-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Does the Rule promulgated under the authority of the Rules Enabling Act in fact fit its description: “rules of practice and procedure"?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c09f35ad-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is the procedure specified in the Rule constitutional? (For an easy negative example, suppose that Rule 65 allowed seizure of real property without notice or special circumstances; that would violate due process.)</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c09f35ae-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the Rule passes both these tests, then it must be applied, even if it differs from the state practice in a significant way. If the Rule fails either test (that is, if it is not “procedural” as the Rules Enabling Act uses that term or if it is unconstitutional), then the state practice applies.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c09f35af-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Harlan’s concurrence expresses skepticism about the “tests” a Rule must pass. In fact, no case has ever held a Rule to be beyond the scope of the Rules Enabling Act, though some have suggested that particular Rules (e.g., Rules 23, 68) come close to the line. Nor has any Rule ever been held unconstitutional, though several have been revised in light of constitutional developments that might have made them subject to attack. See, for example, Rule 65(b), which was revised in the wake of due process cases like <i>Fuentes v. Shevin</i>, infra page 324. Does this record prove Harlan correct?</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c09f5cc2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some examples of such federal “practices”:</p>

<li class=""><p id="c09f5cc3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In many state courts, lawyers are free to roam about the courtroom in addressing a jury, while most federal judges ask lawyers to stay firmly anchored behind the lectern. Many lawyers like the freedom to roam; what if a judge dismissed a diversity case as a sanction for the lawyer’s disobedience to instructions to stay put?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c09f5cc4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another might be differences in the manner in which prospective jurors were questioned: Many states, either by law or custom, permit extensive conversations between jurors and lawyers during jury selection; no statute or Rule governs the matter, but in many federal courts judges do all the questioning and do so very quickly. In a diversity case, could a lawyer insist that she be allowed to question jurors extensively?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c09f5cc5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Byrd</i> and <i>Hanna</i> would approach that question in different ways. <i>Byrd</i> asks whether the practice in question is “bound up with the substantive rights and obligations created by state law” and, if not, whether there is a countervailing interest inherent in the federal system. In the case of the voir dire practice, the answer to the first question will almost always be “no” and to the second “yes.” <i>Hanna</i> asks first whether the practice in question flows from a Rule (no, for voir dire) and, if not, whether following the federal rule would lead to forum shopping or inequitable administration of the law. For voir dire, the answer is uncertain (in some cases, one can imagine a lawyer believing it very important to get a good feel for the jury); if, however, the answer is no (that lawyers wouldn’t choose between state and federal court over such a matter), then <i>Hanna</i> arrives at the same outcome—follow federal voir dire practice—by a different route than <i>Byrd.</i></p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c09f5cc6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Hanna</i> did not overrule <i>Byrd</i>, which it cited with approval.

<p id="c09f5cc9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In your Constitutional Law course, you will study federal “preemption,” a phrase used to describe what happens when federal law occupies a space so completely that it “preempts,” that is, displaces or pushes out state law that might otherwise govern. For example, if ­Congress today passed a statute defining the law of trespass on the tracks of railroads in interstate commerce, that federal statute would preempt the state law that would otherwise govern. It may <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="281" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page281">p. 281</span>be helpful to think of <i>Hanna</i> as a preemption case: When a federal statute or Rule defines procedure in some area, that federal law preempts state law that might otherwise govern.</p>
<p id="c09f5cca-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For federal law to preempt, the federal law must be constitutional and otherwise valid. To preempt, according to standard doctrine, a federal law must in some sense be intended to displace state law. <i>Hanna</i>’s requirement that a Rule must be valid under the Rules Enabling Act sets forth a test of validity for a Rule—a precondition for its preemptive power.</p>
<p id="c09f5ccb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Byrd</i> deals with a softer form of preemption, in which there is no explicit statute or Rule that displaces state practice, only a “custom.” <i>Byrd</i>’s underlying idea seems to be that for the federal courts to constitute an independent judicial system, they must be free to adopt a series of such “practices” (<i>Byrd</i> called them “affirmative countervailing considerations”), even when they depart from what a state court would do. Those might include a number of small matters: <i>Byrd</i> thus protects a number of such small customs that do not rise to the level of law, allowing them to displace analogous state court customs that diverge from their federal counterparts.</p>

<p id="c09f5ccc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Erie</i> and its progeny suggest a set of questions that need to be asked before knowing whether state or federal law applies:</p>

<p id="c09f83ee-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under <i>Hanna</i>’s reading of <i>Erie</i>, many “<i>Erie</i>” questions will not require resorting to the Constitution because Congress by statute or Rule will have told federal courts what to do in the situation. So long as the statute is constitutional (and the Rule conforms to the Rules Enabling Act), the choice of law problem is solved: Federal procedure governs. The difficulty arises when a federal court has to decide whether a federal statute that <i>might</i> occupy the area really does or when, by contrast, a federal statute or Rule should be construed not to conflict with a state practice. A number of pre-<i>Hanna</i> cases, described supra at pages 270-71, raised this issue. Consider some post-<i>Hanna</i> examples.</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="c09f83ef-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38 allows—but does not require—an appellate court to punish frivolous appeals with extra costs. Alabama had a statute that automatically added a 10 percent penalty to an unsuccessful appeal of an award of money damages. In Burlington Northern R. v. Woods, 480 U.S. 1 (1987), the Court held that the federal Rule governed in federal courts, reasoning that the discretionary character of Appellate Rule 38 clashed with the mandatory state statute.</p></li>
<li><p id="c09f83f0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">States have varied in their willingness to enforce forum selection clauses. Alabama had a statute making such a clause unenforceable; did that statute govern in federal diversity litigation? No, said Stewart Org. v. Ricoh, 487 U.S. 22 (1988). The state statute was displaced by 28 U.S.C. §1404 (which you met in Chapter 2), which gives the federal courts discretionary power to move litigation to another district in the interests of justice and for the convenience of the parties. The <i>Stewart</i> Court said that a federal court considering such a transfer motion should weigh all the factors, including the forum selection clause, rather than giving automatic effect to the state’s ban of forum selection clauses. <i>Atlantic Marine Construction</i> (supra page 195) suggests that such forum selection clauses should in most cases be enforced—via §1404.</p></li>
<li><p id="c09fab01-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By contrast, Gasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc., 518 U.S. 415 (1996), struggled to accommodate both state and federal interests. The Reexamination Clause of the Seventh Amendment prohibits federal Circuit Courts of Appeals from re-examining jury verdicts except as permitted at common law. A New York statute required state appellate courts to decide if jury damage awards exceeded “reasonable compensation” and to adjust them downward if they did. The U.S. Supreme Court held that both state and federal interests could be accommodated by allowing the federal <i>district</i> courts to conduct such reviews.</p></li>
<li><p id="c09fab02-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">New York has a statute prohibiting class actions that aggregate statutory penalties—so under New York law an individual can sue for a $1,000 statutory penalty, but ten thousand such persons cannot sue as a class, seeking $10,000,000 in damages. In Shady Grove Orthopedic Assoc., P.A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393 (2010), the Court held that Federal Rule 23, which defines the requirements for bringing federal class actions, displaced <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="283" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page283">p. 283</span>the state statute. As the majority saw it, Rule 23 sets forth the requirements for class certification; because it says nothing about forbidding classes seeking to aggregate statutory penalties, a federal court deciding whether to certify a class should focus exclusively on the Rule’s requirements. In dissent, Justice Ginsburg, the author of <i>Gasperini</i>, argued that it would be possible to accommodate both the Rule and the state statute, by permitting a class action, but not a class seeking to aggregate statutory penalties.</p></li>
<li><p id="c09fab03-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Erie</i> line of cases reaches into several areas of procedural law. One, that we’ll note here but reserve for a later chapter, is how it interacts with the law of former adjudication. Recall from Chapter 1 (<i>Ison v. Thomas</i>) that both state and federal courts have created a law of claim and issue preclusion: Very roughly speaking, a litigant who has brought a case in which a judgment has been entered cannot bring the same case again. But because each state (and the federal system) has its own common law of preclusion, the exact scope of preclusion can vary a bit: A claim that California would preclude from relitigation might not be barred had it been decided in, say, Maryland. To add a wrinkle to this idea, suppose the second case is brought not in California but in Maryland. As you will see in Chapter 11, Maryland would look to California law in deciding the scope of preclusion of the first, California, case. But—to take matters into <i>Erie</i>-land—suppose the first case was decided in California by a <i>federal</i> court sitting in diversity jurisdiction. In Semtek Intl. Inc. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 531 U.S. 497 (2001), the Supreme Court held that the scope of a federal judgment rendered in diversity should be the same as that judgment <i>would have had if it had been rendered by a state court</i> of the state where the federal court was sitting. In the hypothetical (which tracks the facts of <i>Semtek</i>), that would mean that the scope of a judgment of a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction in California should be the same as it would be had the action been brought in a California state court. Stay tuned for Chapter 11.</p></li>

<p id="c09fab06-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Erie</i> requires federal courts sitting in diversity to apply state law under various circumstances. Sometimes, it will be easy for federal courts to determine state law: A recent state supreme court case may have carefully defined it, or the matter may be covered in an authoritative statute.</p>
<p id="c09fab07-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But determining state law can sometimes be difficult. What happens if there is no precedent on point, or the only available precedent is some years old, and the area of law has recently shown signs of change? Or what if the question is complicated by a horizontal choice of law problem like the one that brought forth Judge Henry Friendly’s quip: “Our principal task, in this diversity of citizenship case, is <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="284" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page284">p. 284</span>to determine what the New York courts would think the California courts would think on an issue about which neither has thought.” Nolan v. Transocean Air Lines, 276 F.2d 280, 281 (2d Cir. 1960). For a state trial judge, such uncertainty presents difficulties, but she at least has the assurance that if she is wrong, the state appellate courts will straighten things out. Federal judges, compelled to follow <i>Erie</i>, generally lack that assurance, because a federal court’s erroneous interpretation of state law cannot be appealed to a state court.</p>
<p id="c09fab08-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What, then, should the federal district judge do? Should she predict what the state court would probably do under such circumstances? Should she act as she thinks a state court should act in these circumstances, even if she thinks it would not behave that way? For that matter, which state court should the federal district court seek to resemble—the state trial court, which is often hesitant to depart from precedent—or the state supreme court?</p>
<p id="c09fab09-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The same predicament faces the federal courts of appeals. On appeal from the district court’s judgment, a federal court of appeals must do its best to decide what the state appellate courts would do when faced with the same appeal. Nor may the courts of appeals simply defer to the district court—on the ground that a district court judge from that state has a better feel for his own state’s law. Salve Regina College v. Russell, 499 U.S. 225 (1991) (federal court of appeals required to review de novo district court’s determination of state law).</p>

Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., 622 F.2d 657, 659 (3d Cir. 1980). Holdings based on such predictions of state court views are awkward, especially if the predictions later turn out to be wrong.</p>
<p id="c09fab0c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider, for example, the tangle in Pierce v. Cook &amp; Co., 518 F.2d 720 (10th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1079 (1976). Driver and three passengers were involved in a collision with a truck driven by an independent contractor hauling wheat for Cook. Driver and Passengers each brought actions. Two of the suits were removed to federal courts; the third remained in state court. In the federal court actions defendants won a summary judgment on the basis of 30-year-old state-law precedent relieving Cook of responsibility for the negligence of an independent contractor; the case was affirmed on appeal. Meanwhile, the state trial court had also granted summary judgment—on the basis of the same precedent—but plaintiff appealed to the state supreme court, which overruled the precedent. The state supreme court decision became final more than three years after the original federal appeal.</p>

In 1987, plaintiff invoked diversity jurisdiction to sue a New York art dealer to recover a Monet painting stolen from his family during World War II. The federal court ruled that DeWeerth had failed to satisfy what it understood to be the showing of reasonable diligence in locating stolen property required by state law. Four years later the New York courts in a similar case held that a showing of reasonable diligence was not required under the relevant statute. DeWeerth moved to reopen his federal judgment under Rule 60(b), the same Rule used in <i>Pierce</i>. The Second Circuit sharply rejected the attempt:</p>

<p id="c09fab0f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Erie</i> simply does not stand for the proposition that a plaintiff is entitled to reopen a federal court case that has been closed for several years in order to gain the benefit of a newly announced decision of a state court, a forum in which she specifically declined to litigate her claim.</p>

<p id="c09fab10-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In an effort to render cases like <i>Pierce</i> and <i>DeWeerth</i> less frequent, several states have adopted a process called <i>certification</i>. In certification the federal court asks the state supreme court for an answer to a question about state law. In cases like <i>Pierce</i> and <i>DeWeerth</i>, if the state appellate court announced that it was changing the law, a federal diversity court could do likewise. There are, however, several defects in this system. First, the state must have a certification procedure; some do not. Even when the procedure is available and is used, the results are not always satisfactory. Sometimes state courts do not accept the invitation to answer the question about state law. Other times they answer, but in terms that leave the federal courts as perplexed as they were before. Part of the problem flows from the circumstance that the certification process does not simply pass the whole case to the state supreme court (as review, explain why that would violate the premise of diversity jurisdiction). Instead, the federal court frames a question of law that it asks the state court to clarify. But, in a common law system, legal issues often lie deeply embedded in factual contexts, so it is entirely possible for a state court to “answer” a question about state law but leave the federal court entirely unsure how to apply it to the case at hand.</p>

A is correct because the “Conformity Act,” repealed when the Federal Rules came into effect in 1938 (the same year as <i>Erie</i>), directed the federal courts to follow the procedural law of the state in which the federal court sat. B is correct—then as now: When federal substantive law governs, a federal court will apply it. C is correct, at least in cases governed by “general law”: That’s the holding of <i>Swift v. Tyson</i>. D is correct because that’s how <i>Swift</i> interpreted the Rules of Decision Act, and that interpretation stood until it was overruled in <i>Erie.</i></p>
<p id="c09ff949-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q2.</b>  C is the only correct response. C is correct because most commentators think the best explanation of <i>Erie</i>’s constitutional basis rests not on a specific clause but of constitutional “structure”: The Constitution assumes that states have broad lawmaking powers and that they’re entitled to let their courts (as well as their legislatures) do that lawmaking—and that the federal courts should respect their choices. A and B are wrong because the opinion nowhere references either of these clauses.</p>

A is wrong because the <i>Erie</i> principle will apply whenever state law supplies a claim or defense—as, for example, in a federal question case that includes state law claims brought in under supplemental jurisdiction. B is correct for the reasons explained in A. C is correct (that’s the holding of <i>Hanna v.

<p id="c0a417fe-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In studying the procedural system used in U.S. courts you can take at least two different paths. One path starts from the bottom, examining the way in which an individual lawsuit develops: how the parties state cases, develop information about them, and bring them to resolution. This approach emphasizes features and problems of the contemporary procedural system, which is in many respects a bold experiment. Studying the process of litigation reveals how these features shape and constrain the litigants’ responsibilities and choices. The other path starts from the top, examining the constitutional environment in which the individual lawsuit exists. That approach takes you into both the history and the current interpretation of the Constitution of the United States. Studying that document reveals several limits on the ways in which state and federal court systems conduct their business, limits that have major consequences for individual litigants.</p>
<p id="c0a417ff-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Anyone wanting to become a lawyer has to understand both approaches, comprehending the constitutional environment as well as the modes for processing disputes. This book accordingly contains materials about both, and most courses will examine both. But a course can with equal validity start at the top and work down or begin at the bottom and work up. The three parts of this book are labeled to emphasize those different starting points. Some courses may begin with this section, Part II: The Process of Litigation, comprising Chapters 5-11 and representing the <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="290" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page290">p. 290</span>"bottom-up" approach. Other classes may start with Part I: The Constitutional Framework for U.S. Litigation, comprising Chapters 2-4, the "top-down" approach.</p>
<p id="c0a43f10-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The third part of this book, Part III: Probing the Boundaries: Additional Claims and Parties, combines significant elements of both of the other parts and may be studied either at the end of the course, as a reprise, or in conjunction with either of the other two parts.</p>

<p id="c0a43f13-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since disputing began (which, according to several religious traditions, was shortly after the first humans appeared on the face of the Earth), disputants and whoever helped them resolve their disputes have been faced with procedural choices. One way of framing the choices is as between speed and quality. Everyone wants disputes to be decided quickly; everyone also wants them to be decided correctly—after full exploration of the facts and careful weighing of the law. But even in a world of unlimited resources these two goals conflict, and we have limited resources. Another way to frame the conflict is as between fairness and justice. Everyone wants the judge to be fair as between the parties; everyone also wants the judge to decide in favor of the party on whose side truth lies. But in some cases these goals will conflict; the side with the best presentation may not be the side where truth resides.</p>
<p id="c0a43f14-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These conflicts force those who design procedure (legislators, lawyers, judges) to choose; moreover, they must choose not just once but at every stage of the process. Should all cases go to trial—on the ground that trials may best uncover the truth—or should we weed out most cases before trial, thus speeding the resolution of disputes while increasing the risk of error? Should plaintiffs at the outset have to state their cases in detail—to sort weak from strong cases at an early stage—or would a requirement of detailed pleading trip up plaintiffs with good cases who need access to facts known only to the defendant? How much post-filing factual investigation should we permit, bearing in mind that greater access will turn up more information but also increase cost and delay? How much autonomy should we give to the parties—which will require fewer judges and less public expense—and how much should we insist on judicial responsibility—which may increase public confidence in the outcome but will increase public cost?</p>
<p id="c0a43f15-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Behind these questions lies another, more generalized issue: Is a lawsuit a quest for truth, or a way to settle a dispute? The more we think litigation is an inquiry into truth, the more likely we are to want judges rather than the adversaries to control the inquiry. The more confident we are that litigation reveals the truth, the more likely we are to think it proper to apply the findings of one judge or jury to similar lawsuits. Conversely, the more we see litigation as a battle between the parties, the greater our comfort with giving the parties control over the terms of that battle, but the less we’ll be inclined to think that the personalized battle yields truth.</p>
<p id="c0a43f16-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These and similar questions lie just beneath the surface of contemporary procedural rules: Each rule, and often even innocuous-looking individual words and <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="291" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page291">p. 291</span>phrases within the rules, represents a choice among procedural values. In exploring the development of a lawsuit, we shall be doing at least three things: seeing how a procedural system has made particular choices; seeing how judges and other lawmakers can have second thoughts about those choices; and looking beneath those choices at the values they imply. That exploration is particularly apt because the procedural system we shall explore—that set forth in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure—represents a self-conscious choice of flexibility. The drafters of the Rules (and those who have since amended them) sought above all to break free from what they thought were rigidities of earlier procedural systems. They largely succeeded, but critics have begun to ask whether as a result lawsuits have become unstructured, expensive monsters.</p>

<p id="c0a43f19-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This book explores the answers to such questions by following the development of a lawsuit in roughly chronological order. Chapter 5 looks at why people litigate by exploring the demography of contemporary litigation, the arsenal of remedies courts can grant, and how litigation is financed. Chapter 6—on pleading—explores how lawsuits are commenced. At the commencement of the lawsuit a lawyer must decide whether to join additional claims and parties; for teaching purposes one can explore this question in one of two ways. One approach moves from pleading (the setting forth of claims) to the exploration of facts underlying those claims—that is discovery, explored in Chapter 7. The other approach explores how lawyers join additional parties and additional claims to a lawsuit, the topic of Chapter 12, before examining discovery.</p>
<p id="c0a43f1a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most lawsuits reach the discovery stage; the real question is whether they will go further. Chapter 8 examines a variety of official and unofficial ways in which lawsuits can end during or shortly after the discovery period. If they do not end then, they proceed to trial. Chapter 9 examines who will decide the issues in a lawsuit and what principles limit their freedom of decision. Once the trial is over, the loser may appeal; Chapter 10 examines the availability of and limits on appeals. Whether a lawsuit ends on appeal or at some earlier stage, there may come a quite difficult question: Just what is it that the now-concluded lawsuit has decided? That question, which goes under several doctrinal names, is explored in Chapter 11, Respect for Judgments.</p>

<p id="c0a5779c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">People don’t litigate for fun. Lawsuits cost money. Worse, they are for most participants miserable experiences whether they win or lose. Why would anyone bring a lawsuit? Conversely, plaintiffs almost always seek something in defendant’s power to grant; why, instead of paying up, does defendant choose to add the insult of litigation to what may be the eventual injury of an adverse judgment? And to complete the inquiry, one should also ask whether the expense and unpleasantness of litigation are socially desirable. Should it be easier to commence or defend a lawsuit, or is it already too easy? Lawyers give two labels to these inquiries: remedies (what courts can do to and for litigants) and access to justice (whether barriers to litigation are too high or too low).</p>

<p id="c0a5779f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Trying to answer the questions above is silly without knowing a little about the existing litigation system. Whether litigation should be easier—or whether it is already too easy—should turn on facts, not supposition. Legislators, editorial writers, and scholars debate whether litigation is “out of control.” Some of this debate turns on factual premises. To participate in this debate or to be a well-informed lawyer one needs to know how much litigation there is, what it consists of, how long it takes, and what its results are.</p>
<p id="c0a577a0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="294" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page294">p. 294</span>Because of jurisdictional limits on the federal courts, about 95 percent of litigation in the United States occurs in state courts. In 2008 (the most recent year for which complete data are available), just fewer than 100 million cases were filed in those state courts.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10038_d543d88a-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10038_d543d88a-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*1</a></span> That number represents the outcome of almost two decades (1984-2000) of rising rates of civil litigation, followed by a decade of flat or declining rates, a decline sharpened by the economic downturn. Of those 100 million cases, a bit more than half involve traffic and similar ordinance violations. Some of those cases can significantly affect people’s lives—lost driving licenses, towed cars, and increased insurance premiums—but the adjudication of these claims is not typically what we think of as serious litigation.</p>
<p id="c0a577a2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The remaining 48 million non–traffic ticket cases could be thought of as “serious.” They consist of two large groups—civil and criminal cases—and two specialized subsets of the large groupings: Juvenile cases are specialized criminal cases, and family law (sometimes known as domestic relations) cases are a similarly specialized form of civil litigation.</p>
<p id="c0a577a3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "></p><div style="width:564px" class="epub-image-container" id="c0a59eb4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d"><div class="epub-image "><img alt="A pie chart shows the non-traffic case distribution for 2012." src="./images/9781543808094_Ch05-1.png" style="max-width:564px" aria-describedby="img-longdesc-c0a59eb4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d"></div></div><p></p>
<p id="c0a59eb9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If one excludes the traffic ticket cases and combines domestic relations with general civil cases and juvenile with criminal cases, two large categories emerge, with the civil/domestic cases comprising just over half of the docket and the criminal/juvenile cases just under half.</p>
<p id="c0a59eba-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This course focuses on the civil portion of that litigation. If one includes the domestic relations cases, that’s about 25 million cases; if one excludes the domestic relations cases, as most statistical studies of civil litigation do, the number is about <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="295" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page295">p. 295</span>20 million civil lawsuits per year. As noted, over the preceding 50 years that number first grew then shrank. It shrank both absolutely (total number of cases filed) and on a per capita basis (number of cases per 100,000 population).</p>
<p id="c0a59ebb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why this growth followed by this decline? Experts disagree, but a consensus seems to be forming that civil litigation tracks economic activity. Christian Wollschlager, Exploring Global Landscapes of Litigation Rates (Nomos: 1998) (indicating high litigation rates in developed economies, with Germany, Sweden, Israel, and Austria having higher per capita rates of litigation than the United States). All other things being equal, economic growth produces more civil litigation. Conversely, economic recessions, such as the one the United States has recently passed through, lead to declining rates of civil litigation.</p>
<p id="c0a59ebc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Focusing on the civil lawsuits, one can ask what these 20 million civil disputes were about. Data on this fairly basic question is not definitive, but recent samples suggest the predominance of contract claims. One seven-state sample found the following categories:</p>
<p id="c0a59ebd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "></p><div style="width:564px" class="epub-image-container" id="c0a59ebe-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d"><div class="epub-image "><img alt="A pie chart shows the different categories of civil disputes." src="./images/9781543808094_Ch05-2.png" style="max-width:564px" aria-describedby="img-longdesc-c0a59ebe-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d"></div></div><p></p>
<p id="c0a5c5d7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similar surveys confirm the dominance of contract cases. The leading nonpartisan agency collecting state court statistics summarized: “High-value tort and commercial contract disputes are the predominant focus of contemporary debates, but collectively they comprised only a small proportion. . . . of the caseload. In contrast nearly two thirds were contract cases and more than half of these were debt collection and landlord/tenant cases.” If one reflects on the widespread use of contract as the principal technique for ordering U.S. economic life (including the widespread use of credit), dominance of contract claims makes sense.</p>
<p id="c0a5c5d8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At first glance, you might think a litigator trying to predict the fate of her case, or a public official allocating judicial budgets, would care more about how many cases there are than what they are about. But, like some first impressions, this one turns out to be wrong. No sort of case goes to trial at a high rate: The national <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="296" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page296">p. 296</span>average hovers around 4 percent, with about 90 percent of those trials coming before a judge rather than a jury.</p>
<p id="c0a5c5d9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If all cases went to trial at the same rate, one would expect that most trials would be in contract cases. Not so: Torts, though far less than half of the filings, comprise 60 percent of the trials. In large part this mismatch occurs because so many “contract” cases are essentially debt collection actions, in which there is no real dispute about facts or law. Many of these actions will end not in a trial but in a default judgment.</p>
<p id="c0a5c5da-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When trial does occur, the tort/contract distinction also affects the kind of trial: When contract cases do go to trial, most are tried to a judge (called a “bench” trial), while 90 percent of the tort cases that reach trial go before a jury. Because bench trials are a bit easier to schedule and usually a little faster than jury trials, the mean time to judgment in a contract case is between 9 and 10 months; torts take the longest, about 16 months. Actual trials, when they occur, are short: The mean jury trial lasts less than four days, bench trials two days. As with all averages, these conceal wide variations; two New Jersey cases were reported to have been pending for decades!</p>
<p id="c0a5c5db-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Who wins? Again, the answer differs depending on whether it is a tort or contract case. In tort trials plaintiffs win (that is, get a judgment for some amount above $0) just about half the time (51 percent of jury cases, 56 percent of bench trials). Plaintiffs do better in contract trials, prevailing in just over two-thirds of the cases. Bear in mind that that “winning” can be a relative term: A plaintiff who recovers a judgment for $10,000 has prevailed in court, but may not feel much like celebrating if he turned down an offer to settle for $15,000 before incurring the expense of trial. When plaintiffs win, how much do they recover? News accounts suggest fabulous sums; reality is different. In data collected before the 2009-2016 “Great Recession,” the median recovery in tort cases was between $21,000 and $24,000 (bench and jury verdicts, respectively). In contract cases, the median plaintiff’s judgment was $75,000 in jury verdicts and $25,000 in bench-tried cases (suggesting that perhaps parties choose to try the smaller cases to judges). In fewer than 10 percent of all cases won by plaintiffs does the judgment reach $1 million: 8.3 percent of contract cases tried to a jury, 5.7 percent of tort cases similarly tried. In an analogous data set compiled during the recession (2012-2013), the amounts were somewhat different: a median tort recovery (recall we are talking only about successful plaintiffs) of $64,761; for contracts $9,428. Because the two data sets differed one cannot say with any certainty whether they represent changing trends or sample differences.</p>
<p id="c0a5c5dc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One fact stands out starkly in the 2012-2013 data: In many cases, the cost of competent representation (lawyer’s fees and experts) “likely outstrips the monetary value of the case.” If that conclusion is not an artifact of the recession, it presents a serious challenge to the legal profession and to the legal system, about which we’ll have more to say when we turn, later in this chapter, to litigation finance.</p>
<p id="c0a5c5dd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Seen from a different perspective, these numbers mean that the average stakes in civil litigation lie within $25,000 of the median family income for a year. These are hardly trivial amounts, but neither are they the stuff of urban legend and professional folktales. If there is a serious concern, it would be about litigants who cannot afford competent representation. Still another way to view matters is from <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="297" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page297">p. 297</span>the perspective of the lawyers who operate the system on behalf of their clients. A plaintiffs’ lawyer, even a competent and successful one, could have a career in which she never recovered a million-dollar verdict. On the other hand, a lawyer representing defendants will spend a good deal of his time trying to make sure that his client does not end up on the wrong side of the less-than-10-percent of cases in which there is a seven-figure verdict.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0a5ecfb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the “it’s a problem” side stand those who point out that trials constitute our system’s principal public forum for resolving disputes. Some also stress the importance of jury trials in a democracy, which put lay deciders in charge in a way that echoes the use of elections to resolve political questions: Fewer jury trials means a diminished role for such lay decision makers.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a5ecfc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the “why worry?” side stand those who argue that modern discovery naturally leads to increased settlement rates, and we should applaud, not fret over, those who reach consensual resolutions.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a6140d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For those who think that the decline in trials presents a problem, locating solutions is not easy. Some suggest increased funding for judicial positions and courtrooms, arguing that adjudication plays a critical but underappreciated role in society and the economy. Others look to modern legal culture, which has, they argue, created “litigators” who run the pretrial process but consciously avoid trial—in part because they have had little experience with trial work—and are abetted by judges who themselves may be uneasy with the rapid-fire evidentiary rulings required by trial.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a6140e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Be clear about what trial rates do and do not mean. Although most civil cases will not end in trial, many will end with a judicial decision. Some cases end almost as soon as they begin, with a default judgment: About 14 percent of the total cases and about a quarter of contract cases end with default judgments, probably because a defendant has no defense to a claim for an unpaid debt. For others, the end will come with a pretrial ruling—about jurisdiction, about the sufficiency of pleadings, about discovery issues, or at summary judgment—even though there is no trial. For example, in the federal system, for which we have elaborate statistics, such rulings are dispositive (that is, case-ending) in about one-third of all filings. So a low trial rate does not mean a low adjudication rate. As you will see, a good part of the contemporary litigation process is the pretrial process.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a6140f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those cases that do not end in trial or a pretrial ruling end in events that are more ambiguous: settlement (often reflected in voluntary dismissal) or abandonment (followed by involuntary dismissal for failure to prosecute).</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0a61410-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These terminations may represent a response to the merits: As facts are uncovered, the plaintiff recognizes that what he thought was a strong case has a fatal flaw and gives up rather than throwing good money after bad. Defendant, recognizing that there is only a small chance of a giant plaintiff’s verdict, nevertheless decides not to take that chance and settles to eliminate the risk of a catastrophic judgment. These decisions, though they don’t result in an official resolution of the dispute, represent the litigants’ responses to the merits of the case.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a61411-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alternatively, either outcome may represent surrender to financial exigency: A plaintiff gives up a strong case because she cannot afford to litigate any further; a defendant offers something to make a plaintiff with a trumped-up claim go away because winning on the merits will cost more than the <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="299" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page299">p. 299</span>settlement offered.

<p id="c0a61414-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The people filing the 20 million civil lawsuits each year want something; the people against whom the lawsuits are filed want to know what they stand to lose. To a lawyer, those questions translate into inquiries about what remedies a court will order—what acts it will require of the defendant if the plaintiff prevails.</p>
<p id="c0a61415-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Take a very common and very simple lawsuit. D fails to pay her credit card debt. P wants to collect the debt. To get the state’s help in collecting the debt, the legal system requires P to file suit, describing the claim and asking for a remedy. If P prevails, he gets a judgment, a statement by the court that P is legally entitled to a certain sum of money. P can then use that judgment to get access to various post-judgment remedies to collect that money from any assets that D has. These may include getting an employer to garnish D’s wages, an order attaching D’s checking or savings accounts, or putting a lien on any real property D owns, so the property cannot be sold without paying P. The exact scope and procedures for using these post-judgment remedies lie beyond the scope of this course. For now, you need to understand that a judgment is the key that unlocks these remedies.</p>
<p id="c0a61416-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Remedies embodied in judgments aim to cure a legal harm. Remedies can be divided into two groups—those that seek to provide the plaintiff with a reasonable substitute for whatever was lost (substitutionary remedies) and those that seek to restore directly and specifically that which the defendant has taken from the plaintiff (specific remedies). If, for example, defendant takes plaintiff’s car unlawfully, a specific remedy would be an order (either to the defendant or the sheriff) commanding the return of the car. A substitutionary remedy would be a judgment that defendant pay plaintiff enough money to buy an equivalent car. One issue we will examine is the extent to which plaintiffs can choose between specific and substitutionary remedies.</p>
<p id="c0a63b27-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To create the conditions for a lawsuit, plaintiff must want something that defendant is unwilling to give her. Sorting roughly, there are three such things: money; an enforceable order to do (or not to do) something; or a declaration of the parties’ respective rights. We’ll consider those three remedies, as lawyers call them, in order. We will then consider preliminary relief; remedies ordered before the merits of the case have been adjudicated.</p>
<div id="c0a63b28-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0a63b29-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">1.&nbsp;Damages</p></h3></div>

<p id="c0a63b2a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By far the most common remedy awarded by U.S. courts are judgments for money damages. This frequency of money damages has several causes. One is that in a credit economy many claims are for debts, and a successful debt claim will always <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="300" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page300">p. 300</span>result in a damage judgment. Second, for many common claims specific remedies are impossible: Defendant cannot replace an injured limb or erase the pain of disfigurement or defamation. Money may be a poor substitute, but only a substitute is possible. Because damages are a substitute, however, sometimes the law encounters difficulty in deciding how to measure them. In settlement negotiations the parties bargain directly about how much (or how little) they would accept to dispose of the case. In trials, judges and juries must resort to less direct methods for estimating the value of a substitute. Many of these methods depend on the existence of a market in which the substitute can be priced, but some substitutionary remedies involve damages for which there is no market.</p>
<p id="c0a63b2b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even when there is a market, and even when the defendant is clearly liable, the law requires a plaintiff to prove the amount of damages. Sometimes that’s easy: The damages for an unpaid promissory note are the principal sum plus accrued interest. Sometimes that’s far more difficult: How much is a lifetime of impaired mobility or pain worth? The law insists that judges and juries decide, without a great deal of guidance. The next case displays a judge wrestling with these questions in an unusual context.</p>
<p id="c0a63b2c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As you have seen (or will see) in Chapter 3, under some conditions a defendant can “remove” a case from state to federal court—if there would have been subject matter jurisdiction in federal court. And, as you may already know, there is federal subject matter jurisdiction over cases involving parties from different states when the amount in controversy is more than $75,000. The next case shows the defendant trying to remove—and encountering from plaintiff the argument that damages are insufficient to permit a federal court to hear the case.</p>

<p id="c0a66144-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The present action arises from Plaintiff Zelma Troupe’s slip and fall on premises owned and operated by Defendant C &amp; S Wholesale Grocers and was originally filed in the State Court of Bibb County, Georgia. In the Complaint filed in the State Court, Plaintiff asserts that she suffered “severe physical injuries” and “excruciating and severe physical distress” as a result of Defendant’s negligent inspection and maintenance of its premises. She seeks damages for medical expenses in an amount <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="301" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page301">p. 301</span>"in excess of $13,637.00” and prays for an additional award of “all damages allowed under Georgia Law including, but not limited to, recovery for special and general damages, including pain and suffering, both mental and physical, in the amount to be proven at the time of trial.” Plaintiff further seeks to recover punitive damages, the cost of litigation, and “such other and further relief as this court deems just and proper.” Upon review of the Complaint, Defendant filed a timely Answer and Notice of Removal of the action to this Court. Plaintiff then filed the present motion seeking remand and an award of payment of just costs, actual expenses, and attorney fees incurred.</p>

<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0a66145-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">Discussion</p></div>
<p id="c0a66146-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Any action initially brought in state court may be removed if “the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction.” Title 28 U.S.C. §1441(a). “One category of civil actions with such original jurisdiction is those between ’citizens of different states’ where the amount in controversy ’exceeds the sum or value of $75,000.’” At issue in this case is whether the amount in controversy exceeds that required for this Court to exercise federal subject matter jurisdiction under Title 28 U.S.C. §1332(a)(1).</p>
<p id="c0a66147-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The burden of proving any jurisdictional fact rests upon the party seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts. . . . Generally, when a complaint does not claim a specific amount of damages, “removal from state court is proper if it is facially apparent from the complaint that the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional requirement.” In the event that the jurisdictional amount is not facially apparent on the complaint, “the court should look to the notice of removal and may require evidence relevant to the amount in controversy at the time the case was removed.”</p>
<p id="c0a66148-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The jurisdictional amount may be apparent on the face of the Complaint if the language clearly alleges extensive damages such as long-term medical expenses, mental and physical pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of wages and earning capacity, and permanent disability and disfigurement or other serious injuries. Here, however, the amount in controversy is not so apparent. Simply put, there is no way to determine from the Complaint whether Plaintiff has been so badly injured as to make an award of over $75,000 more likely than not. Plaintiff’s Complaint merely asserts that she suffered “severe physical injuries” and “excruciating and severe physical distress” as a result of Defendant’s negligence, specifies damages for medical expenses “in excess of $13,637.00,” and prays an award of “other special and general damages, including pain and suffering, both mental and physical, in the amount to be proven at the time of trial.” There [is] simply nothing on the face of the Complaint to suggest that she will seek recovery for long-term medical expenses, permanent disability and disfigurement, or loss of wages or diminished earning capacity.</p>
<p id="c0a66149-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant’s Notice of Removal provides more assistance, however. The Notice and attached copies of Plaintiff’s medical records include additional information about the extent of Plaintiff’s injuries: describing the amount of lower back and leg pain Plaintiff endures, detailing her efforts at pain management (including undergoing physical therapy, chiropractic manipulation, and spinal blocks), and showing that her pain continues even a year after the alleged incident. The Court may in fact consider this type of evidence.</p>
<p id="c0a6614a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="302" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page302">p. 302</span>According to the medical records, Plaintiff claims to have fallen on her left hip and back while in the Defendant’s store and that this incident is believed to have aggravated a pre-existing back injury. The records further indicate that Plaintiff complained of severe, unrelenting pain (sometimes categorized as an 8, 9, or 10 on a 10 point scale) which could not be controlled with medication, that such pain persisted even more than a year after her fall, and that she is possibly still incurring medical expenses for pain management. The records also indicate that Plaintiff lives alone, is self-employed, and owns her own house cleaning service. She has stated that her pain is exacerbated by lifting, bending, stooping, prolonged standing—all of which were required in her profession as a house cleaner. Plaintiff in fact told her physicians that she was forced to reduce the number of houses that she could clean because of her back condition and that she had to discontinue personal activities such as exercising, which also aggravated her pain. Such assertions, if proven, suggest that, if she prevails, Plaintiff will likely be able to recover unspecified damages for long term medical expenses, loss of wages and earning capacity, mental and physical pain and suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life in addition to Plaintiff’s specified claim for medical expenses in excess of $13,637.00 and claim for punitive damages.</p>
<p id="c0a6614b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given this additional information, the Court concludes that Defendant has satisfied its burden of establishing that the special, general, and punitive damages in this case, if proven, will “more likely than not” exceed the minimum jurisdictional amount.

<p id="c0a6af7f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because so much civil litigation is about money, any legal rule that limits or increases the amount of damages that can be awarded on a given claim will likely decrease or increase the number of lawsuits brought to vindicate those claims. Some examples illustrate this proposition. In the course of the twentieth century, courts and legislatures expanded the circumstances in which punitive damages were available. The concept behind punitive damages is that they punish defendants for particularly reprehensible behavior—including behavior that does not produce substantial compensatory damages. Punitive damages are generally available for intentional torts—or for behavior falling short of intentionality that is deemed outrageous. That could include behavior ranging from a punch thrown in a fistfight to knowingly selling toxic food products. The potential availability of punitive damages creates a powerful weapon for plaintiffs (and, defendants argue, an unfair advantage). Their power arises because punitives (as they are known in the trade) make the badness of the behavior rather than the damage to plaintiffs the measure of liability, and “badness” is a subjective judgment. And, though punitive <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="304" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page304">p. 304</span>damages are awarded in fewer than 10 percent of civil cases where plaintiffs prevail, in some cases involving large institutional defendants, damage awards have been large indeed.</p>
<p id="c0a6af80-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Statutory damages similarly strengthen plaintiffs’ claims. These are minimum damage awards decreed by legislation, often in situations in which compensatory damages will be small or difficult to prove. For example, the Copyright Act gives holders whose rights have been infringed a choice between proving lost profits and accepting statutory damages in an amount between $500 and $20,000 for a negligent violation and up to $100,000 for a willful violation. 17 U.S.C. §504(c); Feltner v. Columbia Pictures Television, Inc., 523 U.S. 340 (1998) (holding that a jury must set the amount of statutory damages between the applicable minimum and maximum). Minimum damage provisions (often coupled with separate provisions for attorneys’ fees) also arise in the context of small transactions (bad-check statutes provide a common example); they are designed to offset the costs of litigation over matters that are often small in dollar amount and to encourage plaintiffs to enforce public policy by bringing suit.</p>
<p id="c0a6af81-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If punitive and statutory damages have the effect of encouraging litigants to sue in cases where they are available, limiting damages has the opposite effect. In recent decades, some states have sought to curb medical malpractice litigation by putting caps on “noneconomic” damages in such cases. E.g., Cal. Civ. Code §3333.2(b) (capping medical malpractice noneconomic damages at $250,000). Such limitations will, all other things being equal, reduce the number of filings in areas where these limitations apply.</p>
<p id="c0a6af82-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other damage caps result from judicial decisions. Responding to defendants’ arguments that punitive damages were out of control, the U.S. Supreme Court in 2003 ruled that an award of punitive damages more than nine times the compensatory damages in a case will presumptively violate the Due Process Clause. See State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408 (2003). Thus, if in <i>Troupe</i> plaintiff was awarded punitive damages, they would likely be limited to nine times her compensatory damages (medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering). And all jurisdictions prohibit punitive damages on contract claims.</p>
<p id="c0a6af83-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, consider damages that are, in advance of any lawsuit, negotiated between the parties. Given the difficulty of calculating compensatory damages, in some situations the parties try to agree beforehand about the price of the harm. The most common such situations are contractual, in which the parties may agree to liquidated damages for breach of contract. Their power to so agree is limited in several ways. They may not agree to liquidated damages unless the actual damages would be difficult to calculate. The parties could not, for example, agree to liquidated damages of $1,000 for failure to repay a $500 debt. An example of a statute simultaneously permitting and limiting liquidated damages is Uniform Commercial Code §2-718(1):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0a6af84-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Damages for breach by either party may be liquidated in the agreement but only at an amount which is reasonable in light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach, the difficulties of proof of harm caused by the breach, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy. A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is void as a penalty.</p>

<p id="c0a6af87-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Troupe</i> also illustrates another aspect of how lawyers think about damages—dividing them into categories. The opinion twice distinguishes between “special” and “general” damages; lawyers also speak of “hard” and “soft” damages and of “economic” and “noneconomic” damages. Several of these categories overlap.</p>
<p id="c0a6af88-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Start with special, economic, hard damages. The case discusses the medical expenses Troupe has already incurred: $13,637.00. Lawyers sometimes call such damages, as to which one can name a precise figure, as “hard” or “special” damages. In <i>Troupe</i>, other special damages would include lost income from her housekeeping business: She would presumably have records showing how much she had earned in a typical week and how many weeks she had been out of work. Lawyers would also categorize these as “economic” damages: A damage award would serve to compensate her for specific dollar losses—medical expenses and lost earnings.</p>
<p id="c0a6af89-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By contrast, consider Troupe’s claim for pain and suffering. Troupe will not be able to present a receipt for these, but the law treats them as real, compensable injuries. Like pain and suffering, emotional distress may be an element of damages in some cases. So may, in appropriate cases, loss of consortium (harm to a relationship), humiliation, and harm to reputation. These are all examples of general, noneconomic, “soft” damages.</p>
<p id="c0a6af8a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">U.S. law uses damages to compensate for these noneconomic harms as well.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10278_d543d88a-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10278_d543d88a-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*2</a></span> As you might expect, proving and measuring noneconomic damages presents a challenge. Experienced lawyers and insurance adjusters often use rules of thumb in settling such cases: three times the amount of economic damages for pain and suffering is one common guideline. But these guidelines are not part of law, so juries cannot be instructed to use them. Instead, the parties must offer proof of noneconomic damages. A litigation technique popular among attorneys required to offer such “proof” in physical pain and suffering cases is to ask the jury how much it would take to compensate the plaintiff for a single hour’s (or day’s) suffering, and then to multiply that number by the expected duration of the pain—sometimes a lifetime. In Beagle v. Vasold, 65 Cal. 2d 166, 417 P.2d 673, 53 Cal. Rptr. 129 (1966), a trial court was reversed for abuse of discretion because it had refused to permit such an argument. Such efforts are in part a result of jury instructions that do not give many guidelines. Following are model jury instructions that offer little guidance to the fact-finder:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0a6d69c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To recover for [past and future physical pain, mental suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, disfigurement, physical impairment, inconvenience, grief, anxiety, humiliation, or emotional distress], [Plaintiff] must prove that [s/he] is reasonably certain to suffer that harm.</p>
<p id="c0a6d69d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No fixed standard exists for deciding the amount of these damages. You must use your judgment to decide a reasonable amount based on the evidence and your common sense.</p>

There are no lost earnings, and the principal elements of damages will be for the relationships between the deceased and his surviving children and grandchildren. If you represent the plaintiffs, you will want to show a jury the value of the relationships ended by the death—with family pictures, testimony about the frequency of visits to the grandparent, the effect of the grandparent’s death on the children’s emotional well-being. Whom would you want to testify about what? If you represent the defendant, how, concretely, would you seek to minimize damages—maybe with evidence showing that the children continued to thrive in school and had large networks of family and friends?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a6d6a4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sometimes the need for proof of damages serves not as a barrier but as an aid to recovery. In a claim for personal injuries, the badly injured plaintiff seeks to introduce evidence of her cries of pain during physical therapy; defendant objects that such evidence will prejudice the jury. What is plaintiff’s best response?</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0a6d6a5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issues sketched above represent a sample of problems in measuring compensatory damages.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0a6d6a6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sometimes the damage in question has no market. In ascertaining such damages courts do not simply ask the plaintiffs how much it would take to compensate them for the harm they have suffered. One reason for not doing so is the parties’ understandable temptation to exaggerate the amount.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a6fdb7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At other times there is a market, but plaintiff has no access to it. For example, contract doctrines require that the plaintiff mitigate damages by trying to find a substitute for defendant’s breach, even if plaintiff has to borrow money to buy the substitute. But what if plaintiff doesn’t have good credit? See Valencia v. Shell Oil Co., 23 Cal. 2d 840, 845, 147 P.2d 558, 560 (1944) (plaintiff unable to borrow funds necessary to mitigate damage caused by defendant): “The duty to minimize damages does not require an injured person to do what is unreasonable or impracticable, and, consequently, when expenditures are necessary for minimization of damages, the duty does not run to a person who is financially unable to make such expenditures.”</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a6fdb8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="307" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page307">p. 307</span>A third problem arises from the law’s efforts to individualize damages. Such insistence reflects the goal of what might be called the “perfect remedy"—that which provides an exact compensation for the harm suffered by this plaintiff. The goal is noble, but it has its costs, chiefly in the time it takes to establish the precise level of harm. If lawyers and insurance companies regularly use multipliers as rules of thumb, and if predictability is the goal, would statutory schedules (e.g., three times economic damages as pain and suffering in personal injury cases) be a better approach?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a6fdb9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts insisting on such individualization do not mention the cost of vindicating the legal right to compensation—court fees, attorneys’ fees, and the like. The reason for this omission is simple: As you will see in Section C of this chapter, American courts do not typically compensate successful litigants for the cost of litigation. This feature of remedial law means that an award of compensatory damages, no matter how precisely calculated, will always fall short of full compensation if plaintiff has to pay her lawyer.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a6fdba-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As you have seen in the preceding section, lawsuits take time. Time costs money. Courts take account of delay by adding interest to the damages; in cases involving large sums and long delays, the amount of interest and the date at which it starts to accrue will matter. Those rules vary substantially across jurisdictions, making it hard to lay down generally applicable principles. Rules for awarding interest vary depending on whether it is calculated from the time the claim accrues (prejudgment interest) or only during the time between the entry of judgment and the moment when the judgment amount is paid (post-judgment interest).</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0a6fdbb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In most jurisdictions, the nature of the harm sued for will determine whether prejudgment interest accrues. The Restatement (Second) of Torts §913 provides for prejudgment interest for the taking of property and for other pecuniary harms if necessary to avoid injustice, but not for bodily injury, emotional distress, or reputational harms. What theory underlies such a distinction? The Restatement (Second) of Contracts §354 provides for prejudgment interest on actions brought to enforce a sum certain (for example, a promissory note), and for interest on other contracts “if justice requires.”</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a6fdbc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After judgment is entered, most jurisdictions provide for interest to accrue until the judgment is paid, but the rate of interest varies considerably. Federal law (28 U.S.C. §1961) ties such post-judgment interest to the rate of one-year U.S. Treasury Bills. Some states, however, have fixed rates, which may be above or below the prevailing rate (for example, 10 percent in California. Civ. Proc. Code §685.010 (Matthew Bender 2010)).</p></li>

<p id="c0a6fdbf-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Though damages are the most commonly sought remedy, they are not the only available one. Courts may order parties to do things or to refrain from doing them; they also can enlist the help of officials in recapturing personal or real property <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="308" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page308">p. 308</span>from defendants wrongfully possessing or occupying it. Lawyers refer to these remedies as specific remedies. Take an agreement for the purchase of a house. If the market drops and the buyers get cold feet, the sellers can sue for the difference between the agreed-on price and the new (lower) market price—a substitutionary remedy. If the market rises and it is the sellers who back away from the agreement, the buyers now have a choice of remedies. They might sue for damages measured by the difference between the contract price and the market price of an identical house—a substitutionary remedy. But another remedy would also be available—an order from the court commanding the sellers, under penalty of contempt, to convey the property. Such a “decree for specific performance” is one among an array of available specific remedies.</p>
<p id="c0a6fdc0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose the sellers sign the deed conveying their house, but then refuse to vacate for the new buyers. Under those circumstances the buyers could seek to eject the sellers, getting a court order that required the sheriff to remove them from the premises. Or, suppose when the sellers left, they mistakenly left behind some jewelry. Under those circumstances the sellers could replevy the jewels: A successful action of replevin results in a court order requiring a sheriff to return an item to its owner.</p>
<p id="c0a6fdc1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to these specialized remedies, courts have broad power to enter injunctions (court orders directed to parties) commanding them to do or stop doing an act. Some of these orders can be narrow and specific: stop dumping waste on plaintiff’s property. Others can be complex and subtle: establish a system of outpatient psychiatric assistance that meets the needs of patients currently institutionalized. In the twentieth century many of the most interesting and controversial remedies were specific: for example, racial integration of schools and places of employment; and changes in the operation of prisons, hospitals, and other institutions.</p>
<p id="c0a6fdc2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The power to issue injunctions—as opposed to other forms of specific relief—derives from the jurisdiction exercised by the courts of equity in England and later in the colonies. Since at least the sixteenth century, courts have withheld equitable relief—refusing to grant injunctions and other equitable remedies—unless the plaintiff could demonstrate that the forms of relief offered by the common law were “inadequate.” The next case displays a court considering whether and why a legal remedy—damages, in this instance—was inadequate.</p>

<p id="c0a724d8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff’s prima facie case tends to show the following facts: that defendant Ellen S. Geoghegan has been a patient for a considerable length of time at Sibley <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="309" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page309">p. 309</span>Memorial Hospital, which is maintained and operated by the plaintiff corporation. The hospital is a private hospital. Evidence has been further introduced tending to show that the hospital came to the conclusion that the patient no longer needs hospital care but can be adequately provided for at a nursing home.</p>
<p id="c0a724d9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After a series of negotiations on June 2nd, 1967 the president of the hospital corporation made a formal demand on the defendant Thomas Geoghegan, the husband of the other defendant, that Ellen Geoghegan, his wife, be transferred from Sibley Memorial Hospital. This demand is worded as follows: “I again request you to make arrangements for the transfer of your wife, Ellen Geoghegan, from Sibley Memorial Hospital.” The mere fact that the polite word “request” is used does not detract from the tenor of the letter as a demand.</p>
<p id="c0a724da-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What, then, is the status of the defendant Ellen Geoghegan when her departure from the hospital has been demanded by the hospital? Manifestly she becomes a trespasser. This action is brought for an injunction to require her removal from the hospital as a trespasser. Obviously an action for damages would be an inadequate remedy.</p>
<p id="c0a724db-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A private hospital has a right to accept or decline any patient. It has a moral duty to reserve its accommodations for persons who actually need medical and hospital care and it would be a deviation from its purposes to act as a nursing home for aged persons who do not need constant medical care but who need nursing care. There are homes for the aged, there are nursing homes and similar institutions. Hospitals have a duty not to permit their facilities to be diverted to the uses for which hospitals are not intended.</p>
<p id="c0a724dc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The correspondence introduced in evidence shows that the male defendant takes the position that his wife should remain in the hospital for the remainder of her life. For the hospital to permit that would be to allow a diversion of its facilities to purposes for which they are not intended and would not be in the public interest. An action for damages, of course, would present no solution so far as the plaintiff is concerned because the husband is able and willing to pay whatever the hospital would charge.</p>
<p id="c0a724dd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It has been established for a great many years that equity will enjoin a continuing trespass or a series of repeated trespasses where an action for damages would not be an adequate remedy. There is a leading English case on that point, London &amp; Northwestern Railway Co. v. Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Railway Co., Law Reports 4 Equity Cases 174, 179. The Supreme Court has approved and enforced this doctrine on many occasions. . . . This Court had occasion to consider this matter in Potomac Electric Power Co. v. Washington Chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality, 210 F. Supp. 418, 419, and stated, “It is well established that equity may enjoin continuing trespasses, repeated or irreparable injuries to property, or a course of illegitimate interference with business activities, if a remedy by an action for damages is not adequate. This is one of the traditional functions of equity.”</p>
<p id="c0a724de-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is clear that in this case the damages in an action at law would obviously be inadequate, as has already been stated.</p>
<p id="c0a724df-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In light of these considerations the defendants’ motion to dismiss is denied.</p>

<p id="c0a74bf6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Historically, the power to issue injunctions was lodged not in the courts of common law, but in the Court of Chancery, which administered substantive law and remedies called “equitable.” The judge in Chancery was the Lord Chancellor, who was both a judge and a high political official: Imagine that the President’s Chief of Staff also ran a judicial system. Because a central function of equity was to solve problems created by the rigidities of common law, and because the Chancellor was, by virtue of his position, sensitive to broader political and social implications of his decisions, equity jurisprudence, as it was called, often took account of factors that a court of common law would not. For example, it often looked to see whether someone seeking an equitable remedy had himself behaved properly—had, as the doctrine put it, “clean hands.” It also took explicitly into account the public interest—something you see in <i>Geoghegan</i>. And, to a greater extent than common law, it gave substantial discretion to the Chancellor in shaping its rulings. Though equitable remedies in U.S. courts are no longer ordered by gentlemen wearing large wigs, substantive law and the remedies administered still have much of the texture created by centuries of English equity practice.</p>

<p id="c0a77315-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Occasionally, a party has a legal problem that neither damages nor a specific remedy can solve. Imagine, for example, that Alice, whose signature appears on a promissory note due in five years, denies the note’s validity. How is Sam, holding the note, to determine whether he has a valuable asset or a worthless piece of paper? He cannot sue for damages until the note is due, and there is no claim for injunctive relief on the facts stated. Meanwhile, witnesses’ recollections are fading and Sam, who wants to raise money for a small business, cannot with certainty list the note as an asset. Or suppose Entrepreneur has a potentially important (and profitable) invention he wants to bring to market, but his potential investors are frightened by those in competing industries who contend that his device will infringe their patents. Entrepreneur has as yet suffered no harm and cannot get an injunction or damages—but he wants a court to declare that his invention does not infringe existing patents—allowing him to reassure his would-be investors. Or imagine a theater owner wants to show a film declared obscene by the local prosecutor, who has threatened to prosecute anyone who exhibits the film. Thinking that the film is not obscene, the owner wishes to show it. He wants to abide by the law, however, and doesn’t want to risk a jail sentence as the price of guessing wrong about the law of obscenity.</p>
<p id="c0a77316-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once upon a time, Sam, Entrepreneur, and Theater Owner would have been able to rely only on “counsel’s opinion” about the legality of their proposed course of action. Under the federal Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§2201 and <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="312" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page312">p. 312</span>2202, and similar statutes in almost every state, parties in such circumstances may now seek from a court a declaration of their rights without seeking or being in a position to seek any coercive relief such as damages or an injunction. The procedure for declaratory judgment in the federal courts is governed by Rule 57. Unlike equitable relief, which is available only in the absence of adequate legal remedies, declaratory relief may be chosen by a party even though other remedies are open to her. See Rule 57. In fact, one can see the declaratory judgment statute as designed in part to overcome this limitation.</p>

<p id="c0a79a33-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although Congress passed the federal Declaratory Judgment Act in 1911, the statute has created several knotty problems for the federal courts. Most of these problems lie beyond the boundaries of an introductory course in civil procedure, but brief mention will help connect this topic to other parts of this course and other courses:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="c0a79a34-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One concerns the line between a hypo­thetical case and a concrete factual controversy. Article III of the Constitution limits federal courts’ jurisdiction to “cases and. . . . controversies.” Trivially, that means a law student cannot dream up a hypothetical and ask a federal court to resolve it. Because in many declaratory judgment actions no present coercive relief is available, some claims look too much like hypothetical questions—and thus lie outside the boundaries of Article III. In this introductory course we won’t probe the line between appropriate and inappropriate actions for declaratory relief.</p></li>
<li><p id="c0a79a35-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Declaratory relief can also raise juris­dictional problems, some of which flow from the interaction of the well-pleaded complaint rule (exemplified in <i>Louisville &amp; Nashville R.R. v. Mottley</i>, supra page 210) and the requirements of federal question jurisdiction. The premise of the well-pleaded complaint rule is that courts look at the allegations in a plaintiff’s complaint to determine whether federal subject matter jurisdiction exists. Declaratory judgment actions, however, tend to be brought by potential defendants against those that would sue them (and so are seeking a declaration of their rights regarding the contested issue). How should courts, instructed to follow the well-pleaded complaint rule, view the complaint in a declaratory judgment action that raises a federal question? The courts have said that a party who would assert a federal defense in an action for coercive relief cannot create federal jurisdiction by asserting that defense as a claim for declaratory relief. That means the Mottleys could not have pleaded their way into federal court simply by asking for declaratory relief (even if the statute had existed at the time they brought their case). But the courts have also suggested that if either party could state a claim for coercive relief that would arise under federal jurisdiction, then an action for a declaratory judgment will also “arise under” federal law; it is safe to say that not much more is clear, and that when you study federal jurisdiction in an advanced course you will better understand how vexing the question is.</p></li>
<li><p id="c0a79a36-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other issues might arise about the interaction between declaratory relief and diversity jurisdiction. Imagine that Insurer, from Texas, sues Joe, from California, in federal court, seeking a declaration that Joe’s $100,000 life insurance policy is invalid because he fraudulently misrepresented his medical record in applying for the <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="314" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page314">p. 314</span>insurance. Joe challenges diversity jurisdiction, on the grounds that Insurer’s complaint does not satisfy the amount in controversy requirement because he seeks no monetary damages. The fact that Insurer does not seek monetary damages does not necessarily mean he cannot sue in federal court. Instead, the court will look to see the value of the declaratory relief. In this case, the value of the declaratory relief would be tied to the amount of insurance that would have to be paid at Joe’s death if the policy were valid.</p></li>
<li><p id="c0a79a37-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What about other issues? If P sues D for breach of contract, P bears the burden of producing evidence and the burden of persuasion. But if D sues P for a declaration that D has not violated the contract in question, who should bear these burdens? The case law is again muddled on the subject. And if D sues P for a declaration that D has not breached a contract on which P might have sued either for damages or for specific performance, is either entitled to a jury trial? See Chapter 9.</p></li>

<p id="c0a7c14f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A remedy that comes too late is useless—worse than useless if the client has incurred costs to obtain it. In state and federal courts currently the median time to trial (for those cases that do go to trial) is a bit more than 18 months. Litigants cannot always wait. Interest added to money judgments is one recognition of the importance of delay. But life sometimes demands speed. The battered spouse needs a protective order immediately, not after a year’s wait for trial. The small business threatened by a competitor’s unlawful action will be bankrupted if it has to wait for trial. Provisional remedies—relief pending final adjudication of the dispute—respond to this need.</p>
<p id="c0a7c150-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although provisional remedies solve some problems, they create others: Because they must be granted or denied before the case has been heard on the merits, the judge (all temporary relief will be granted by a judge, not a jury) must base her decision on incomplete information and act without the full adversarial exchange that would accompany a trial. This section considers two problems: How should a court decide when to grant temporary relief in the face of incomplete information? And when does the curtailment of ordinary procedures that is necessary to grant temporary relief amount to a denial of due process?</p>
<p id="c0a7c151-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before addressing these issues notice a spectrum of provisionality created by the Rules and analogous state practices. A final injunction—like that sought in <i>Lucy Webb Hayes Natl. Training School v. Geoghegan</i> (page 308)—occurs after a full trial, with all the procedure that entails. But what if time itself will make the eventual remedy meaningless because the threatened harm will already have occurred? In principle, the answer is an order that holds things in place while the court decides whether final relief is appropriate. See Rule 65. Such orders come in three versions with successively smaller procedural protections—and correspondingly greater speed. The preliminary injunction one might think of as “trial lite”: It occurs after evidentiary presentations and argument—but with perhaps curtailed discovery and less than complete evidence. Faster—and more temporary—is the temporary restraining order; as the phrase implies, it lasts for a limited time—usually just long enough to have a hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction. The most dramatic form of the temporary restraining order is the ex parte T.R.O.—ex parte meaning that the order is issued without notice to the opposing party or opportunity for that party to present evidence or argument. Why would a court issue such an order—and why wouldn’t it violate the most basic concepts of due process? A careful reading of Rule 65(b) suggests a reason: Suppose that the very act of notifying the opposing party will cause the threatened harm? Perhaps the defendant will spirit the money that might satisfy a damage judgment out of the reach of the court, or retaliate against the spouse or partner seeking the order. In such cases courts <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="316" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page316">p. 316</span>issue very short-term orders: Rule 65(b) says no longer than 14 days with a provision for a hearing on two days’ notice if sought by the party subject to the order.</p>

<p id="c0a7c154-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Getting from the opening pleading to final relief takes time, and preliminary injunctions (and their siblings, temporary restraining orders) exist to deal with harms that arise from that inevitable delay. But such preliminary relief comes with a built-in problem. First, a court entering such an order necessarily knows less than it would after full evidentiary presentation (that’s why it’s preliminary). Second, sometimes entering such a temporary order can help the plaintiff only by harming the defendant. The Supreme Court faced such a situation in the next case; did it resolve it correctly? And are the principles it establishes for similar cases the right ones? As you consider these questions, note that, though the case cites various federal statutes, the Court is debating standards that either a state or a federal court might apply in any case seeking a preliminary injunction.</p>

One of the most important ways the Navy prepares for war is through integrated training exercises at sea. These exercises include training in the use of modern sonar to detect and track enemy submarines, something the Navy has done for the past 40 years. The plaintiffs complained that the Navy’s sonar training program harmed marine mammals, and that the Navy should have prepared an environmental impact statement before commencing its latest round of training exercises.

<p id="c0a7e870-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sharing the waters in the SOCAL operating area are at least 37 species of marine mammals, including dolphins, whales, and sea lions. The parties strongly dispute the extent to which the Navy’s training activities will harm those animals or disrupt their behavioral patterns. The Navy emphasizes that it has used MFA sonar during training exercises in SOCAL for 40 years, without a single documented sonar-related injury to any marine mammal. The Navy asserts that, at most, MFA sonar may cause temporary hearing loss or brief disruptions of marine mammals’ behavioral patterns.</p>
<p id="c0a7e871-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiffs are the Natural Resources Defense Council, Jean-Michael Cousteau (an environmental enthusiast and filmmaker), and several other groups devoted to the protection of marine mammals and ocean habitats. They contend that MFA sonar can cause much more serious injuries to marine mammals than the Navy acknowledges, including permanent hearing loss, decompression sickness, and major behavioral disruptions. According to the plaintiffs, several mass strandings of marine mammals (outside of SOCAL) have been “associated” with the use of active sonar. They argue that certain species of marine mammals—such as beaked whales—are uniquely susceptible to injury from active sonar; these injuries would not necessarily be detected by the Navy, given that beaked whales are “very deep divers” that spend little time at the surface.</p>

<p id="c0a7e873-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The procedural history of this case is rather complicated. The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA), 86 Stat. 1027, generally prohibits any individual from “taking” a marine mammal, defined as harassing, hunting, capturing, or killing it. 16 U.S.C. §§1362(13), 1372(a). The Secretary of Defense may “exempt any action or category of actions” from the MMPA if such actions are “necessary for national defense.” §1371(f)(1). In January 2007, the Deputy Secretary of Defense—acting for the Secretary—granted the Navy a 2-year exemption from the MMPA for the training exercises at issue in this case. The exemption was conditioned on the Navy adopting several mitigation procedures. . . . </p>
<p id="c0a7e874-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 83 Stat. 852, requires federal agencies “to the fullest extent possible” to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for “every. . . . major Federal actio[n] significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.” 42 U.S.C. §4332(2)(C) (2000 ed.). An agency is not required to prepare a full EIS if it determines—based on a shorter environmental assessment (EA)—that the proposed action will not have a significant impact on the environment. 40 CFR §§1508.9(a), 1508.13 (2007).</p>
<p id="c0a7e875-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In February 2007, the Navy issued an EA concluding that the 14 SOCAL training exercises scheduled through January 2009 would not have a significant impact on the environment. . . . </p>
<p id="c0a7e876-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Shortly after the Navy released its EA, the plaintiffs sued the Navy, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the grounds that the Navy’s SOCAL training exercises violated NEPA, the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), and the Coastal Zone <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="318" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page318">p. 318</span>Management Act of 1972 (CZMA). The District Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction and prohibited the Navy from using MFA sonar during its remaining training exercises. The court held that plaintiffs had “demonstrated a probability of success” on their claims under NEPA and the CZMA. The court also determined that equitable relief was appropriate because, under Ninth Circuit precedent, plaintiffs had established at least a “’possibility’” of irreparable harm to the environment. Based on scientific studies, declarations from experts, and other evidence in the record, the District Court concluded that there was in fact a “near certainty” of irreparable injury to the environment, and that this injury outweighed any possible harm to the Navy.</p>
<p id="c0a7e877-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[After an appeal, the District Court narrowed the terms of its injunction to allow the Navy more flexibility; the Navy continued to challenge the narrowed injunction as unjustified.]</p>
<p id="c0a7e878-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeals further determined that plaintiffs had carried their burden of establishing a “possibility” of irreparable injury. Even under the Navy’s own figures, the court concluded, the training exercises would cause 564 physical injuries to marine mammals, as well as 170,000 disturbances of marine mammals’ behavior. Lastly, the Court of Appeals held that the balance of hardships and consideration of the public interest weighed in favor of the plaintiffs. The court emphasized that the negative impact on the Navy’s training exercises was “speculative,” since the Navy has never before operated under the procedures required by the District Court. In particular, the court determined that: (1) the 2,200-yard shutdown zone imposed by the District Court was unlikely to affect the Navy’s operations, because the Navy often shuts down its MFA sonar systems during the course of training exercises; and (2) the power-down requirement during [certain] conditions was not unreasonable because such conditions are rare, and the Navy has previously certified strike groups that had not trained under such conditions. The Ninth Circuit concluded that the District Court’s preliminary injunction struck a proper balance between the competing interests at stake.</p>

<p id="c0a80f8c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.</p>
<p id="c0a80f8d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District Court and the Ninth Circuit concluded that plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their NEPA claim. [The Navy challenged this finding, but the majority opinion found it unnecessary to resolve the parties’ disagreement.]</p>
<p id="c0a80f8e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District Court and the Ninth Circuit also held that when a plaintiff demonstrates a strong likelihood of prevailing on the merits, a preliminary injunction may be entered based only on a “possibility” of irreparable harm. The lower courts held <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="319" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page319">p. 319</span>that plaintiffs had met this standard because the scientific studies, declarations, and other evidence in the record established to “a near certainty” that the Navy’s training exercises would cause irreparable harm to the environment.</p>
<p id="c0a80f8f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Navy challenges these holdings, arguing that plaintiffs must demonstrate a likelihood of irreparable injury—not just a possibility—in order to obtain preliminary relief. On the facts of this case, the Navy contends that plaintiffs’ alleged injuries are too speculative to give rise to irreparable injury, given that ever since the Navy’s training program began 40 years ago, there has been no documented case of sonar-related injury to marine mammals in SOCAL. . . . For their part, plaintiffs assert that they would prevail under any formulation of the irreparable injury standard, because the District Court found that they had established a “near certainty” of irreparable harm.</p>
<p id="c0a80f90-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree with the Navy that the Ninth Circuit’s “possibility” standard is too lenient. Our frequently reiterated standard requires plaintiffs seeking preliminary relief to demonstrate that irreparable injury is likely in the absence of an injunction. Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95 (1983). Issuing a preliminary injunction based only on a possibility of irreparable harm is inconsistent with our characterization of injunctive relief as an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.</p>
<p id="c0a80f91-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is not clear that articulating the incorrect standard affected the Ninth Circuit’s analysis of irreparable harm. Although the court referred to the “possibility” standard, and cited Circuit precedent along the same lines, it affirmed the District Court’s conclusion that plaintiffs had established a “’near certainty’” of irreparable harm. . . . </p>
<p id="c0a80f92-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As explained in the next section, even if plaintiffs have shown irreparable injury from the Navy’s training exercises, any such injury is outweighed by the public interest and the Navy’s interest in effective, realistic training of its sailors. A proper consideration of these factors alone requires denial of the requested injunctive relief. For the same reason, we do not address the lower courts’ holding that plaintiffs have also established a likelihood of success on the merits.</p>

In each case, courts “must balance the competing claims of injury and must consider the effect on each party of the granting or withholding of the requested relief.” Amoco Production Co., 480 U.S., at 542. “In exercising their sound discretion, courts of equity should pay particular regard for the public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of injunction.” Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S., at 312.

<p id="c0a80f99-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While we do not question the seriousness of these interests, we conclude that the balance of equities and consideration of the overall public interest in this case tip strongly in favor of the Navy. For the plaintiffs, the most serious possible injury would be harm to an unknown number of the marine mammals that they study and observe. In contrast, forcing the Navy to deploy an inadequately trained antisubmarine force jeopardizes the safety of the fleet. Active sonar is the only reliable technology for detecting and tracking enemy diesel-electric submarines, and the President—the Commander in Chief—has determined that training with active sonar is “essential to national security.”</p>
<p id="c0a836aa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The public interest in conducting training exercises with active sonar under realistic conditions plainly outweighs the interests advanced by the plaintiffs. Of course, military interests do not always trump other considerations, and we have not held that they do. In this case, however, the proper determination of where the public interest lies does not strike us as a close question. . . . </p>

Consistent with equity’s character, courts do not insist that litigants uniformly show a particular, predetermined quantum of probable success or injury before awarding equitable relief. Instead, courts have evaluated claims for equitable relief on a “sliding scale,” sometimes awarding relief based on a lower likelihood of harm when the likelihood of success is very high. 11A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure §2948.3, p. 195 (2d ed. 1995). This Court has never rejected that formulation, and I do not believe it does so today. . . . </p>

For example, in many business transactions, market conditions will mean that even a short delay makes the transaction financially infeasible. Raider Corporation wants to buy Sluggish Co. for several million dollars. The management of Sluggish seeks a preliminary injunction, alleging that the acquisition will violate securities laws and mean the loss of scores of jobs if Raider tries to cut expenses. Raider opposes the injunction, contending that Sluggish’s management is only trying to protect their ill-deserved salaries, and arguing that even a three-week delay (until a fuller hearing can occur) will mean the expiration of their financing for the acquisition. Given the standards for a preliminary injunction articulated in <i>Winter</i> how would you, sitting as the district court judge, rule on such a motion?</p></li>

The dilemma, of course, exists only because the court’s interlocutory assessment of the parties’ underlying rights is fallible in the sense that it may be different from the decision that ultimately will be reached. The danger of incorrect preliminary assessment is the key to the analysis of interlocutory relief. . . . The court need not consider every harm resulting from an erroneous preliminary decision, but only harm that final relief cannot address.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0a884e2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority opinion succinctly states one approach: “A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.”</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a884e3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Ginsburg’s dissenting opinion succinctly states a slightly different approach: “Consistent with equity’s character, courts do not insist that litigants uniformly show a particular, predetermined quantum of probable success or injury before awarding equitable relief.

<li class=""><p id="c0a884e4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some lower court opinions express a variation of Justice Ginsburg’s sliding scale: “One moving for a preliminary injunction assumes the burden of demonstrating either a combination of probable success and the possibility of irreparable injury or that serious questions are raised and the balance of hardships tips sharply in his favor.” Charlie’s Girls, Inc. v. Revlon, Inc., 483 F.2d 953 (2d Cir. 1973) (emphasis added).</p></li>

If one construes the holding narrowly, no: The outcome of the case turns on the majority’s understanding of the public interest on the facts of the case, rather than the other elements of the standard. After discussing what sounds like the sliding scale standard in disapproving terms ("We agree with the Navy that the Ninth Circuit’s ’possibility’ standard is too lenient"), the majority opinion then gives two reasons why it need not—and perhaps cannot—base its holding on this aspect of the case:</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0a884e6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the majority notes, the Ninth Circuit’s decision did not turn on that standard, since the District Court had found “that plaintiffs had established a ’near certainty’ of irreparable harm.”</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a884e7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Instead the Supreme Court could rest its holding on a view of the public interest that sharply diverged from that of the Ninth Circuit—assigning <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="323" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page323">p. 323</span>more weight to the military’s view of the importance of the sonar exercise for national defense.</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0a884e8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Focus now on this latter public interest factor, and recall <i>Lucy Webb Hayes Natl. Training School v. Geoghegan</i> (supra page 308), which also spoke of the public interest—there of having hospitals devote their care only to patients who need medical attention. Recall that in awarding damages for breach of contract or for negligently inflicted injuries, courts do not debate whether such damages would be in the public interest. Why here?</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0a884e9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At one level the answer is fairly simple: For torts and contracts we have concluded, often over centuries, that society functions better if we award damages in such settings, so we don’t need to debate the issue anew in each case. By contrast, cases seeking injunctive relief often involve, as do <i>Winter</i> and <i>Geoghegan</i>, unusual or unique facts—as to which we haven’t worked out the public interest.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a884ea-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a very few categories of injunctive relief cases we’ve worked that out as well. As you’ll learn in Property, courts will almost always order specific performance (a special kind of injunctive relief) for a contract to sell real estate. In cases so ordering one won’t find much discussion about the public interest: The court simply decides that if there was a contract the seller will be ordered to convey title.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a884eb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At another level, the concern about the public interest flows from the equitable tradition (described above at page 310).</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0a884ec-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How did <i>Winter</i> get to the U.S. Supreme Court when there was no final judgment? Though appeals in the federal courts generally lie only from final judgments of the district courts (28 U.S.C. §1291), §1292(a)(1) creates an important exception to the final judgment rule, allowing interlocutory appeals from orders “granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions.” Preliminary injunctions are “injunctions” for purposes of the statute. Do the circumstances of <i>Winter</i> explain why Congress permitted immediate appeals?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0a884ed-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Preliminary injunctions are a provisional form of injunctive relief. There are also processes that are in effect provisional monetary relief—attachment and garnishment. The first involves seizure of property (in the case of real property the “seizure” may be accomplished by anything from physical occupation of the land to the symbolic posting of a notice at whatever office keeps track of titles to land). Garnishment involves asking some third party—often the defendant’s bank or employer—not to pay defendant money due him because the plaintiff has a claim on it. The justification for these provisional remedies resembles that for the preliminary injunctions: Without them the plaintiff may suffer severe hardship, in some cases extreme enough to render a final remedy meaningless. A plaintiff seeking damages may believe that the defendant will, if given enough time, either dissipate or conceal the assets from which a judgment could be satisfied. Under such circumstances, the plaintiff needs relief before a final judgment. That relief comes, however, at a price to the defendant. As with preliminary injunctive relief, these remedies can work great hardship <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="324" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page324">p. 324</span>on the defendant and give significant power to the plaintiff who obtains such an order. Not only does the attachment or garnishment guarantee the plaintiff that there will be some assets from which a judgment may be satisfied, but it may also provide significant leverage in settlement discussions.</p></li>

<p id="c0a8ac02-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In some situations, the very procedural steps required to obtain a preliminary injunction will cause or exacerbate the threatened harm. For example, a defendant served with notice of an application for an order garnishing her bank account may transfer the money abroad or flee the jurisdiction to avoid service of process. A defendant accused of battering a spouse might inflict new harm if served with a notice of hearing on a preliminary injunction. But the absence of notice collides with another principle: the guarantee of due process. The next case illustrates the collision; it is important in its own right and as a reminder that all procedures are subject to examination under the Due Process Clause. The procedure under scrutiny, replevin, was a common law action more than 800 years old when its modern use was challenged. Historically, replevin arose because feudal landlords, if they thought their tenants were not paying rents and other obligations when due, would, without judicial authorization, seize the tenants’ goods, often livestock. The tenants, in turn, would replevy the cattle, by getting an order telling the sheriff to return them until a court had sorted out who owed whom what. Although historically replevin thus represented a debtor’s remedy (retrieving the seized cattle from the landlord), in more recent times it has come to be used by creditors—as it is in the next case.</p>

Both statutes provide for the issuance of writs ordering state agents to seize a person’s possessions, <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="325" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page325">p. 325</span>simply upon the ex parte application of any other person who claims a right to them and posts a security bond. Neither statute provides for notice to be given to the possessor of the property, and neither statute gives the possessor an opportunity to challenge the seizure at any kind of prior hearing.

(Firestone) under a conditional sales contract calling for monthly payments over a period of time. A few months later, she purchased a stereophonic phonograph from the same company under the same sort of contract. The total cost of the stove and stereo was about $500, plus an additional financing charge of over $100. Under the contracts, Firestone retained title to the merchandise, but Mrs. Fuentes was entitled to possession unless and until she should default on her installment payments.</p>
<p id="c0a8d31b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For more than a year, Mrs. Fuentes made her installment payments. But then, with only about $200 remaining to be paid, a dispute developed between her and Firestone over the servicing of the stove. Firestone instituted an action in a small-claims court for repossession of both the stove and the stereo, claiming that Mrs. Fuentes had refused to make her remaining payments. Simultaneously with the filing of that action and before Mrs. Fuentes had even received a summons to answer its complaint, Firestone obtained a writ of replevin ordering a sheriff to seize the disputed goods at once.</p>
<p id="c0a8d31c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In conformance with Florida procedure, Firestone had only to fill in the blanks on the appropriate form documents and submit them to the clerk of the small-claims court. The clerk signed and stamped the documents and issued a writ of replevin. Later the same day, a local deputy sheriff and an agent of Firestone went to Mrs. Fuentes’ home and seized the stove and stereo. . . . </p>
<p id="c0a8d31d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mrs. Fuentes instituted the present action in a federal district court, challenging the constitutionality of the Florida prejudgment replevin procedures under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

<p id="c0a8d320-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the Florida statute challenged here, “[a]ny person whose goods or chattels are wrongfully detained by any other person. . . . may have a writ of replevin to recover them.  . . . ” Fla. Stat. Ann. §78.01 (Supp. 1972-1973). There is no requirement that the applicant make a convincing showing before the seizure that the goods are, in fact, “wrongfully detained.” Rather, Florida law automatically relies on the bare assertion of the party seeking the writ that he is entitled to one and allows a court clerk to issue the writ summarily. It requires only that the applicant file a complaint, initiating a <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="326" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page326">p. 326</span>court action for repossession and reciting in conclusory fashion that he is “lawfully entitled to the possession” of the property, and that he file a security bond in at least double the value of the property to be replevied conditioned that plaintiff will prosecute his action to effect and without delay and that if defendant recovers judgment against him in the action, he will return the property, if return thereof is adjudged, and will pay defendant all sums of money recovered against plaintiff by defendant in the action. Fla. Stat. Ann. §78.07 (Supp. 1972-1973).</p>
<p id="c0a8d321-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the sole basis of the complaint and bond, a writ is issued “command[ing] the officer to whom it may be directed to replevy the goods and chattels in possession of defendant. . . . and to summon the defendant to answer the complaint.” If the goods are “in any dwelling house or other building or enclosure,” the officer is required to demand their delivery; but if they are not delivered, “he shall cause such house, building or enclosure to be broken open and shall make replevin according to the writ. . . . ” Thus, at the same moment that the defendant receives the complaint seeking repossession of property through court action, the property is seized from him. He is provided no prior notice and allowed no opportunity whatever to challenge the issuance of the writ. After the property has been seized, he will eventually have an opportunity for a hearing, as the defendant in the trial of the court action for repossession, which the plaintiff is required to pursue. And he is also not wholly without recourse in the meantime. For under the Florida statute, the officer who seizes the property must keep it for three days, and during that period the defendant may reclaim possession of the property by posting his own security bond in double its value. But if he does not post such a bond, the property is transferred to the party who sought the writ, pending a final judgment in the underlying action for repossession. . . . </p>

<p id="c0a8d323-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For more than a century the central meaning of procedural due process has been clear: “Parties whose rights are to be affected are entitled to be heard; and in order that they may enjoy that right they must first be notified.” It is equally fundamental that the right to notice and an opportunity to be heard “must be granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c0a8d324-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the right to notice and a hearing is to serve its full purpose,. . . . it must be granted at a time when the deprivation can still be prevented. At a later hearing, an individual’s possessions can be returned to him if they were unfairly or mistakenly taken in the first place. Damages may even be awarded to him for the wrongful deprivation. But no later hearing and no damage award can undo the fact that the arbitrary taking that was subject to the right of procedural due process has already occurred. “This Court has not. . . . embraced the general proposition that a wrong may be done if it can be undone.” This is no new principle of constitutional law. . . . Although the Court has held that due process tolerates variances in the form of a hearing “appropriate to the nature of the case,” <i>Mullane v. Central Hanover Tr. Co</i>., and “depending upon the importance of the interests involved and the nature of the subsequent proceedings [if any],” <i>Boddie v. Connecticut</i>, the Court has traditionally insisted that, whatever its form, opportunity for that hearing must be provided before the deprivation at issue takes effect. “That the hearing required by due process is subject to waiver, and is not fixed in form does not affect its root requirement that an individual be <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="327" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page327">p. 327</span>given an opportunity for a hearing before he is deprived of any significant property interest, except for extraordinary situations where some valid governmental interest is at stake that justifies postponing the hearing until after the event.” The Florida and Pennsylvania prejudgment replevin statutes fly in the face of this principle. To be sure, the requirements that a party seeking a writ must first post a bond, allege conclusorily that he is entitled to specific goods, and open himself to possible liability in damages if he is wrong, serve to deter wholly unfounded applications for a writ. But those requirements are hardly a substitute for a prior hearing, for they test no more than the strength of the applicant’s own belief in his rights.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN106CC_d543d88a-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N106CC_d543d88a-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">13</a></span>  . . . </p>
<p id="c0a8fa36-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The minimal deterrent effect of a bond requirement is, in a practical sense, no substitute for an informed evaluation by a neutral official. More specifically, as a matter of constitutional principle, it is no replacement for the right to a prior hearing that is the only truly effective safeguard against arbitrary deprivation of property. While the existence of these other, less effective, safeguards may be among the considerations that affect the form of hearing demanded by due process, they are far from enough by themselves to obviate the right to a prior hearing of some kind. . . . </p>

First, in each case, the seizure has been directly necessary to secure an important governmental or general public interest. Second, there has been a special need for very prompt action. Third, the State has kept strict control over its monopoly of legitimate force: the person initiating the seizure has been a government official responsible for determining, under the standards of a narrowly drawn statute, that it was necessary and justified in the particular instance. Thus, the Court has allowed summary seizure of property to collect the internal revenue of the United States, to meet the needs of a national war effort, to protect against the economic disaster of a bank failure, and to protect the public from misbranded drugs and contaminated food.</p>
<p id="c0a8fa3d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Florida and Pennsylvania prejudgment replevin statutes serve no such important governmental or general public interest.

<p id="c0a8fa3e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor do the broadly drawn Florida and Pennsylvania statutes limit the summary seizure of goods to special situations demanding prompt action. There may be cases in which a creditor could make a showing of immediate danger that a debtor will destroy or conceal disputed goods. But the statutes before us are not “narrowly drawn to meet any such unusual condition.” And no such unusual situation is presented by the facts of these cases.</p>
<p id="c0a8fa3f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statutes, moreover, abdicate effective state control over state power. Private parties, serving their own private advantage, may unilaterally invoke state power to replevy goods from another. No state official participates in the decision to seek a writ; no state official reviews the basis for the claim to repossession; and no state official evaluates the need for immediate seizure. There is not even a requirement that the plaintiff provide any information to the court on these matters. The State acts largely in the dark. . . . </p>

We agree with the District Court, however, that there are recurring situations in which prior notice and hearing cannot be insisted upon.

<p id="c0a995a2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Aside from what courts can do for—or to—them, clients are interested in how much it will cost them to get—or defend against—that relief. Costs of litigation affect clients and lawyers from the very start. The costs of litigation also influence questions about remedies, explored in the prior section of this chapter. Were you to eavesdrop on a conversation between a lawyer and a prospective client, you might be surprised to learn that one of the first things the lawyer wants to know focuses on the remedy sought: What damages are at stake, what injunctive or other relief is sought? The attorney may be trying to understand his client’s interests, but will also be thinking about the feasibility of bringing the case. A system that depends on parties to bear the costs of developing the case requires lawyers to think about the amount at stake in relation to the costs of litigating the case. A case that will require thousands of dollars in expert witnesses and hundreds of hours of lawyers’ time—but where only $2,000 is at stake—is not viable unless the prevailing party will recover its attorneys’ fees from the loser, something that generally happens only when a contract or a statute specifically requires that the loser pay. Similarly, a case in which defendant has a likely meritorious defense that will cost more than the damages claimed is one the lawyer will advise defendant to settle quickly. Conversely, other cases will be inexpensive to bring or defend, even if the amounts at stake are very large.</p>
<p id="c0a995a3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is possible (and, we think, illuminating) to think about litigation as an investment. The plaintiff, in bringing his case, is seeking something of value. This could <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="333" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page333">p. 333</span>be money in the form of damages. But even in cases seeking entirely equitable relief or a declaratory judgment, the plaintiff is seeking some outcome that is, at a minimum, valuable to him or to a group of similarly situated persons: smaller class sizes in the public schools, increased medical services to low-income patients, cleaner air for the region, or similar outcomes.</p>
<p id="c0a995a4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff who decides to litigate in order to gain something of value must invest his money (and time) in that litigation. This investment decision is actually a series of decisions, as the parties decide whether to begin and then to continue to pursue the case. To understand this investment perspective one must understand two subsidiary points: where the money comes from; and how lawyers and their clients decide whether to continue investing in the suit. We start with the former.</p>
<p id="c0a9bcb5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some costs—the courtroom, the judge, clerical staff, and bailiffs—are borne by society generally, paid for by taxes. This public subsidy is not trivial; in 1993 one state estimated that each “judge-day” of civil litigation cost about $4,000, which is about $6,500 in 2019 dollars. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §1775(f) (West 2011).</p>
<p id="c0a9bcb6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other expenses are paid by the parties. Some take the form of fees paid directly either to a court or to nonlawyers who perform some service (e.g., expert witnesses, private investigators, court reporters). But attorneys’ fees account for much of the cost of litigation in the United States; those fees are often substantial. Relatively high legal fees result in part from the design of the U.S. legal system, which assigns to parties (and their lawyers) responsibility for conducting the suit: Virtually every step of the lawsuit occurs because the lawyer on one side or the other takes some initiative. In other countries a judge or similar official paid by the state assumes some of these responsibilities; that design results in lower legal fees but higher taxes and less party control of litigation strategy.</p>
<p id="c0a9bcb7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Legal fees shape contemporary litigation. Any fee system in which the parties bear any costs of litigation will cause cases to be brought, abandoned, or settled on bases other than their legal and factual merits. Financing systems will affect not only how many suits are brought but also which ones; for example, the availability of punitive or statutory damages in a particular case category, combined with contingent fees, will, all other things being equal, move legal resources toward such cases. Conversely, limitations on damage awards will move resources away from such cases. Understanding civil litigation therefore requires comprehending the incentives and barriers to litigation posed by the way in which lawyers are paid. In thinking about fee systems, consider three sorts of incentives: those for the client (when will a prospective litigant be encouraged or discouraged?); those for the lawyer (how will the fee system affect the lawyer’s work on the case once it is under way?); and those for the opposing party, who will have their own financing mechanisms and know or can make educated guesses about the financing mechanisms of their adversaries (how will those guesses about financing affect opposition strategy?).</p>

<p id="c0a9e3ce-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Who pays for lawyers’ work? Essentially, there are five candidates: the client, the opposing party, third-party financers, society generally (via subsidies or charity), and the lawyer herself (because she does the work for free). Each accounts for a portion of U.S. civil litigation.</p>
<p id="c0a9e3cf-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The system in which each party pays its own legal fees has come to be known as the American Rule. Under the English Rule (which prevails not only in England but in most of the legal systems of the developed world), the losing party pays both its own fees and those of the other side. In practice, these distinctions are less than absolute: To an increasing extent someone other than the client pays U.S. legal fees, and in Great Britain less than the full amount of actual fees is generally taxed to the other side. Thus these two “rules” do not accurately describe present practice in either country; they serve, however, as useful models and a starting point from which to explore the subject.</p>
<p id="c0a9e3d0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The English Rule in its pure form fully compensates a winning plaintiff: She gets both the damages (or other remedy) and the costs of litigation. By contrast, under the pure American Rule, a winning plaintiff has to subtract from any damages recovered the amount charged by his lawyer, and is to that extent made less than whole. Defenders of the American Rule point out that it permits litigants, typically plaintiffs, with tenable but less-than-certain cases to invoke the legal system without fear of having to bear the expense of both their own and the <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="335" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page335">p. 335</span>opposition’s attorney. That incentive may be particularly important in a political system in which the courts play a significant role (as they do not in Britain) in protecting the constitutional rights of unpopular groups. One might not wish to burden an unsuccessful effort to protect a constitutional right with the legal fees of the victor.</p>

<p id="c0aa0aec-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Let us begin to explore the structure of fee arrangements under the American Rule with a common situation—the client who agrees to pay the lawyer’s fee. Often, but not always, agreements take the form of a written contract between lawyer and client, sometimes called a “retainer letter” (from the still-regular practice of requiring a deposit—a retainer—from a client). In some states such written agreements are required in some categories of cases. One common form of agreement calls for the client to pay the lawyer at a specified hourly rate for legal services, plus various costs—photocopying, telephone calls, and the like.</p>
<p id="c0aa0aed-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The hourly fee is probably the most common financing mechanism for U.S. litigation. Most contract and commercial litigation, which, as you may recall, accounts for the majority of civil filings, is financed this way. One study done in 2000 found that the median hourly rate for legal fees was about $110 per hour; this average masks very wide variations, with senior lawyers in large urban practices charging over $1,000 per hour and rural solo practitioners charging as little as $75 per hour.</p>
<p id="c0aa0aee-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Flat rates mean a lawyer charges a set amount for a particular matter: an uncontested divorce, a will, and so on. Some lawyers use flat rates alone or in combination with other kinds of compensation. Flat rates have the obvious advantage of a predictable, guaranteed fee. Their disadvantages are equally clear. Underestimates are possible: What begins as an uncomplicated conveyance can turn into a nightmare of legal research or title searches, forcing the lawyers to choose between malpractice and very expensive—and uncompensated—work. Yet if the lawyer tries to allow for such contingencies, she risks charging more than the matter warrants or the market will bear. As a consequence, flat rates are most often used for kinds of work that the lawyer thinks will have predictable investments of time: Wills are probably the most common example. Conversely, many lawyers have <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="336" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page336">p. 336</span>traditionally resisted handling contested litigation on a flat-rate basis. The last decade, however, has seen erosions of this resistance, and some practice groups that do high volumes of work for a single client have entered into per-case agreements or, sometimes, annual flat rates for all litigation, relying on the law of averages to smooth things out.</p>

<p id="c0aa3209-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus far, the discussion has assumed that the client will pay legal fees directly out of current assets. Often, however, that will not be the case. Consider an everyday occurrence—an automobile accident like that described in Chapter 1, in which Peters sues Dodge for injuries and property damage. In that common type of litigation in the United States it is unlikely that either side will pay its own legal expenses directly. Both Peters and Dodge will probably have their fees paid through schemes that spread the costs among other similarly situated persons. And recent years have seen an extension of this concept into third-party litigation finance, in which “investors” in a lawsuit will assume major responsibility for its funding.</p>

In that policy the insurer makes two promises: that it will pay damages up to the policy limit; and that it will provide a lawyer to defend any claim. Most vehicle owners have thus purchased a form of legal insurance. Homeowners’ and tenants’ insurance policies typically contain similar provisions for claims arising from household accidents, thereby creating a widespread form of legal insurance for potential individual defendants.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0aa5924-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why do you suppose the insurers also want to control settlement? Because insurers are paying legal fees for the defense, they want at a minimum to settle cases when legal fees will be more than the proffered settlement. One category of insurance policy where the insured has the right to veto a settlement is, in some states, medical malpractice, where the physician’s license may depend on the ability to vindicate her medical judgment in court. Not surprisingly, such medical malpractice insurance policies are more expensive than many other forms of liability policy.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0aa5925-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The power to control settlement can also shape litigation. Suppose the same auto accident, this time with a seriously injured plaintiff whose claims, if valid, will warrant high damages. But suppose liability is questionable and <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="338" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page338">p. 338</span>the policy limits are $50,000. Plaintiff offers to settle for $50,000; the defendant’s insurer declines, litigates on the merits, and loses a $500,000 verdict. In many states, the insured might have an action for “bad faith” refusal to settle the claim within policy limits. If the insured wins such an action, the insurer is liable for the full amount of the verdict and, perhaps, for punitive damages as well. Under such circumstances, one can find insurers settling claims where liability may be questionable, or, sometimes, defending such claims after agreeing in advance to pay any verdict above the policy limit. Suppose you represent a plaintiff in a case where damages will exceed policy limits but the insurer—contesting liability—won’t settle. How might you use the threat of bad faith liability to your client’s advantage in settlement negotiations?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0aa5926-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For some categories of liability insurance, insurers write policies to provide that both legal fees and the amount of the judgment or settlement are subject to the policy limits—this is, for example, a common term in legal malpractice insurance. Under such a policy, $1 million in coverage would support a $200,000 defense and an $800,000 judgment but would not cover all of a $200,000 defense and a $1 million judgment.</p></li>

<p id="c0aa803b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs’ lawyers will generally be pleased to learn that a defendant has insurance that might cover the damages sought. But complications can arise. Most common forms of liability insurance (auto, homeowners’, tenants’) cover damages for negligently inflicted injuries—only. Suppose two co-workers, Sally and Ted, are involved in an auto accident in their employer’s parking garage. Ted sustains a broken leg, which is expected to heal without lasting effects, and, because of his employer’s sick leave, he will not suffer lost wages. Thus far Ted’s lawyer will be happy to learn that Sally has auto liability insurance, but he will also understand that in these circumstances compensatory damages are unlikely to be large. Further suppose, however, that Sally and Ted have had a contentious relationship at work (she believes he is trying to undermine her with her supervisor) and that, just before the accident a witness thinks he heard Sally (through her open car window) say something <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="339" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page339">p. 339</span>suggesting that she intended to run into Ted. As a matter of law, that opens the door to punitive damages, which could be a multiple of the compensatory damages at stake—a prospect that might at first please Ted’s lawyer. But only at first: Many insurance policies do not cover damages for intentionally inflicted injuries or punitive damages. So, if Ted indeed proves that punitive damages are warranted (because Sally acted intentionally), he may thereby have taken the case outside the boundaries of insurance coverage! What should he do?</p>

<p id="c0aa803e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What about Peters, the plaintiff in our hypothetical auto collision case from Chapter 1? His automobile liability policy will provide counsel to defend against any counterclaim the other driver may bring, but it will not pay his attorneys’ fees to prosecute his claim as a plaintiff. A peculiarly American fee arrangement—the contingent fee—may, however, perform a similar function. In a contingent fee arrangement, the lawyer typically agrees to represent the client, with the fee to be paid from the proceeds of any settlement or recovery. A standard contingent fee arrangement might award the lawyer 20 percent of a settlement reached before filing suit, 25 percent if suit is filed but no further steps taken, 33 percent if the case goes to trial, and perhaps 50 percent if the case goes to appeal. In return for these hefty chunks taken from the plaintiff’s recovery, the lawyer agrees to forgo a fee entirely if there is no recovery: The plaintiff thus eliminates the risk of paying legal fees in a losing cause. For the client with limited funds the idea is often inviting—he pays only if he recovers something. No recovery means no fee.</p>
<p id="c0aa803f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most individual plaintiffs seeking damages for personal injuries enter into contingent fee arrangements, even when their finances would permit them to hire a lawyer on an hourly basis and even if they are offered alternatives.</p>
<p id="c0aa8040-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">People sometimes praise or malign the contingent fee system without understanding it. To understand it one must consider several perspectives: that of the individual client, the lawyer’s other clients, and the lawyer. The client is assured that he will not suffer out-of-pocket expenses for attorney’s fees, which may make the client more willing to bring a case where recovery is uncertain. Some have criticized and others have praised the system for this characteristic. This assurance (of a risk-free lawsuit for the client) comes at a cost that becomes apparent if one considers the position of the lawyer and the lawyer’s other clients. The lawyer, to be sure, does not charge the plaintiff any fees if the case is lost, but the lawyer has lost the value of his time and incurred expenses—if only such overhead items as rent, payment for digital resources, and paralegal services. Those expenses must be paid, and the only source of payment is the fees generated by clients who have recovered or settled. In setting fees, the lawyer must take the probability of success into account; fees from successful cases must be higher to cover the expenses incurred in unsuccessful cases. To that extent contingent fees cause the successful clients to bear part of the costs attributable to the unsuccessful clients.</p>
<p id="c0aa8041-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="340" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page340">p. 340</span>To describe it thus is not to condemn the arrangement; the winners are only going to pay legal fees if in fact they recover something, and the guarantee of no fee if they lose may be an assurance for which they would willingly pay the higher fee if they win. Indeed, the prevalence of such arrangements may suggest that all concerned find them satisfactory. An elaborate study of contingent fee lawyers found that their “effective hourly rate” (their mean hourly earnings including both winning and losing cases) was just a few dollars more than their counterparts in the insurance-retained defense bar. Herbert M. Kritzer, The Wages of Risk: The Returns of Contingency Fee Legal Practice, 47 DePaul L. Rev. 267 (1998). A more recent study by the Federal Judicial Center found that plaintiffs’ attorneys charging their clients by the hour “reported costs almost 25% higher than those using other billing methods (primarily contingency fee).” Emery G. Lee III &amp; Thomas E. Willging, Federal Judicial Center, Litigation Costs in Civil Cases: Multivariate Analysis, Reporting to the Judicial Conference Advisory Committee on Civil Rules 6 (2010).</p>
<p id="c0aa8042-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One can think of the contingent fee in several ways. For medieval and early modern lawyers it was an antisocial charge that stirred up dissension and disserved society.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN109BD_d543d88a-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N109BD_d543d88a-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*3</a></span> This view, still prevalent in parts of the world today, makes a contingent fee a form of criminal activity.</p>
<p id="c0aaa754-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alternatively, one can see the contingent fee as a form of insurance. The client buys insurance against losing the case; the “premium” is her agreement that if she wins she’ll pay a share of her winnings to the lawyer. Just as all drivers who insure with a given insurance company share risks with their fellow-insureds, each contingent fee client pools his risk with that of the other clients of the same lawyer. So long as the lawyer is a good estimator of risks (or has a sufficiently large inventory of cases), the winners and the losers will balance out.</p>

<p id="c0aaf588-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the course of the nineteenth century, U.S. courts struggled with the question of whether either the contingent fee or liability insurance should be lawful.</p>
<p id="c0aaf589-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case against the contingent fee came from the common law’s antipathy to “stirring up trouble,” an antipathy that some historians would say was really antipathy about “the wrong sort of people” bringing lawsuits. By the end of the nineteenth century, U.S. courts, unlike their English counterparts, had decided it was lawful, although “careful Victorian[-era] lawyers gave it the same reception they gave ballroom dancing: that the masses engaged in it and the police did not intervene meant only that it was lawful,” not desirable. Wolfram, Modern Legal Ethics 527 (1986).</p>
<p id="c0aaf58a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unease with liability insurance had a different source: Some feared that it would encourage bad behavior. After all, if one takes seriously the idea that negligence is the failure to take reasonable precautions, then negligent defendants had acted in an “unreasonably dangerous” fashion. Some feared that allowing them to insure against the consequences would encourage them to behave in this socially undesirable way. By contrast, many states now require auto drivers and owners to carry liability insurance: Earlier generations might have shaken their heads sadly.</p>
</div>
<p id="c0aaf58b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, consider the contingent fee from the lawyer’s perspective. Take first the decision to represent a client. For the hourly fee lawyer, each bill-paying client is a source of income, no matter what the merits of her case. Not so for the contingent fee lawyer: For her, only the successful cases will yield any income. Moreover, <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="342" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page342">p. 342</span>many cases will require substantial investment by the lawyer—fact investigators, expert witness fees, deposition travel—all of which have to be paid even if there is no recovery. So she may screen her cases more carefully than the hourly fee lawyer, turning away clients for whom recovery is unlikely or damages are likely to be low or uncollectible.</p>
<p id="c0aaf58c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another incentive may affect the lawyer once she takes the contingent fee case. All lawyers owe their clients the duties of loyalty and competence, but financial self-interest sometimes creates a tension with these ethical obligations. Hourly fee lawyers are paid for their work regardless of the merits of the case; they may, therefore, be tempted to spend more time on the case than it warrants. The contingent fee corrects this problem—by encouraging a lawyer to work as much as necessary to win the case (so that the plaintiff recovers) but not more than is necessary (because doing so would reduce his hourly rate). But the contingent fee creates its own tensions with ethical obligations. The contingent fee can make it far preferable from an attorney’s perspective to settle early, even if the plaintiff could recover more were she to wait. Suppose, for example, defendant makes a settlement offer of $10,000 after the plaintiff’s lawyer has worked for 10 hours on a case. If the retainer agreement provides that the plaintiff’s attorney receives 25 percent of any recovery, the attorney would receive $2,500—meaning that each hour of her time has yielded $250. Imagine that the plaintiff rejects the settlement, the plaintiff’s attorney works for another 40 hours on the case, and then defendant makes another settlement offer of $40,000. The plaintiff’s attorney’s 25 percent fee would amount to $10,000. This amount is larger in absolute terms, but results in a lower per hour fee: $200. The client has ultimate authority to decide whether to accept a settlement agreement, but one can imagine how these financial considerations might affect the lawyer’s advice if the client asks, as many clients do, whether the lawyer thinks a settlement offer should be accepted.</p>

<p id="c0ab1ca8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An ordinary banker would not enthusiastically welcome a lawyer applying for a loan with a lawsuit as the only collateral—in part because most bankers are not expert at valuing lawsuits. Over the past decade, however, new forms of litigation finance have emerged in which specialized lenders do essentially that. Some call this form of litigation finance “third-party” finance; others point out that insurers and contingent fee lawyers are themselves third-party financers and prefer “alternative” or “non-traditional” as a more accurate label.</p>
<p id="c0ab1ca9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whatever the label, the field has seen the proliferation of financing mechanisms. Thus far three principal groups of alternative litigation financers have emerged, each with a different business model.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10ABF_d543d88a-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10ABF_d543d88a-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*4</a></span></p>

<p id="c0ab1cab-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Consumer Lending.</i></b> Some groups lend directly to clients (almost always plaintiffs in personal injury cases), giving them immediate cash in the form of a “loan” that will not be collected if the borrower does not collect a judgment. Moreover, the total repayment will never exceed the amount collected from the judgment or settlement. One study counted nearly 40 such firms in early 2010. If you have recently watched daytime television in any urban area, you will have encountered some of these lenders. They offer rates of interest that vary widely, from about 15 percent upwards and often increase as the time of the “loan” extends. Their business model seems to entail lending only a small percentage (generally 10 percent or less) of what they think might actually be recovered in the underlying lawsuit, often amounting to only a few thousand dollars. Anecdotes suggest that plaintiffs’ lawyers are often unhappy when their clients resort to such lenders because the amount that will have to be repaid often can make the client resist what the lawyers think are reasonable settlement offers. Such lenders present alternatives—higher priced alternatives—to an ordinary loan that a consumer might take out. One imagines that many of the borrowers are those who do not have access to ordinary loans, probably because they appear to be bad credit risks. Alternatively, some borrowers who understand the non-recourse feature of these loans may think of them as a <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="344" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page344">p. 344</span>way of assuring that they will get some recovery from a lawsuit whose outcome is uncertain; it may be only a thousand dollars, but that’s better than nothing, their thinking might go.</p>
<p id="c0ab1cac-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Lawyer Lending.</i></b> Like many businesses large and small, lawyers sometimes borrow to finance expenses incurred while waiting for clients to pay their bills (in the case of hourly fee lawyers) or for judgments and settlements to be paid (in the case of contingent fee lawyers). When the bank lends in such a situation, it is indirectly lending against the expected proceeds, not from a single lawsuit, but from the lawyer’s whole portfolio of cases. As one banker who writes loans to lawyers put it:</p>

<p id="c0ab1cad-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One thing we do is to look at a firm’s collateral base—its receivables, its inventory, how much it makes. . . . With a plaintiffs’ firm, there is no asset base.

<p id="c0ab1cae-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If a lawyer tells you, “I’m going to invest $1 million in this case and it’s the only one I have, and I’m sure I’ll get paid on June 30,” we know that’s not how it always works. We are more inclined to lend money to someone who says, “I have seven cases and a business plan that includes a worst-case scenario of what may happen to them.”</p>

These entities usually charge higher interest rates than do banks, for the same reason that the consumer lenders described above charge higher interest rates than banks—because the borrower, here the lawyer, is not a good credit risk. Should a lawyer have to disclose to a client that this is how he is financing his practice?</p>
<p id="c0ab1cb0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Direct Investment in Commercial Claims.</i></b> The preceding two models represent niche-market credit, in which neither lender does much investigation of particular claims. Not so with the third group of alternative financers, who invest directly in lawsuits. They will contract either with parties or with the parties’ lawyers, advancing money to finance particular pieces of litigation. Their business model calls for them to assess the merits of commercial litigation offered to them, then to advance sums ranging up to $100 million to finance that litigation; in return they get a share of any recovery. According to the available information (most of the investors in this market are not publicly traded, so information is spotty), they are interested only in major commercial litigation—principally in antitrust, intellectual property, and contract disputes—though one news account described a firm that was investing in divorce litigation of very wealthy individuals. One news report suggested that such funding has attractions both for lawyers and their clients and investors. For lawyers and clients, such funding enables them to undertake high-stakes litigation knowing that they can pursue a case as far as the merits take them. Investors include “pension funds, university endowments family offices and others [that] have collectively pumped more than a billion dollars into the sector in recent years.” Sara Randanzo, Litigation Finance Attracts New Set of Investors, Wall St. J. (May 15, 2016).</p>

The law firms and the entities seeking this form of litigation finance are almost without exception able to finance such litigation themselves, or to borrow at favorable rates to do so. Why, then, might they find this form of finance attractive? Though information is hard to come by, a couple of possibilities suggest themselves. First, the businesses concerned may not want to tie up this much of their working capital in litigation—as the news report just cited put it, such funding “give[s] corporations and law firms a way to shed risk from their balance sheets.” They are, after all, in business to make widgets or software or pharmaceuticals and may rather spend their money in an area where they are more familiar with the risks and rewards. An additional attraction might lie in getting a second opinion about the merits of their lawsuit. True, their own lawyers think their case is strong, but it might be reassuring to get another expert to vouch for that—and to back up the assessment by putting millions of dollars behind it. For a law firm the attractions may include the second-opinion feature; for a firm working on a contingent fee basis, accepting an investment of this type also eliminates some of the risk of a zero-recovery outcome.</p>
<p id="c0ab1cb2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The broad policy issues involved in this emerging form of finance are quite varied and made more difficult to assess by the circumstance that we have as yet relatively little experience with the form. Moreover, both enthusiasts and critics often make sweeping arguments that fail to distinguish this form of litigation investment from the preceding two.</p>
<p id="c0ab43c3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alongside the broad policy issues stand some more technical ones. Most states still have on their books prohibitions against champerty and maintenance. Some forms of alternative litigation finance would be unlawful were these laws applied according to their original medieval understandings. Should they be? Probably the strongest argument against such an interpretation emerges if one realizes that both the contingent fee (accepted in every state in the United States) and insurance would also violate the original understanding of these common law crimes. If the contingent fee is lawful, can it be a crime for nonlawyers to do what amounts to the same thing? It’s fair to say that working out thoughtful answers to this and other questions will take some time.</p>

The existence of subrogated claims ("liens” as they are often called in the trade jargon) may make the prospect of a lawsuit less attractive to your lawyer—because she knows that much of any eventual recovery may be consumed by the claim in subrogation.</p></li>

<p id="c0ab6ae3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Insurance will help only those who have it. Contingent fee systems will help only those who seek to recover money damages (and enough money damages to justify the lawyer’s investment of time). Alternative litigation finance will reach only segments of the market for legal services. That leaves substantial numbers of people who could benefit from legal counsel but who have no means to pay for it. But how substantial?</p>
<p id="c0ab6ae4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Much depends on how the question is asked. Some would ask how many people would benefit—in the sense of improving their present position—from legal advice or representation but do not think they can spare the money for such assistance. Others would ask how many people handed say, $2,000 (about 20 hours of lawyer’s time at about the national median rate), would choose to spend it on legal fees. Legal services organizations often measure need by asking the first question, the response to which yields a picture of widespread unmet legal need. For example, the federally funded Legal Services Corporation (LSC) reported in 2013 that nearly 21 percent of Americans had incomes that qualified them for legal assistance, and the funded agencies are able to assist only a small fraction of that group. The response to the second question suggests that the demand is much lower. Debate occurs over which form of the question is the right one to ask.</p>
<p id="c0ab6ae5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However great the need, all agree that it’s concentrated in pockets. It helps to separate those needing legal services into plaintiffs and defendants and further to separate plaintiffs into those seeking damages and those seeking relief other than damages. Contingent fee arrangements “cover” people with meritorious claims for significant amounts—providing a market-based form of legal services for plaintiffs seeking money damages. Fee-shifting statutes (infra page 351) can help plaintiffs seeking smaller damages awards or injunctive relief for claims covered by those statutes. Class actions, powered by the common fund theory (infra page 350), can aggregate small claims—though such actions perform better at deterring defendants (and, some would add, compensating lawyers) than at compensating plaintiffs.</p>
<p id="c0ab6ae6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What about defendants? In a market economy, people with no insurance and no assets have a grim form of protection against lawsuits: Almost no one intentionally sues a judgment-proof defendant for damages. That leaves two good-sized groups without access to representation: individual plaintiffs with small claims (for whom the legal system has no good answer, regardless of wealth) and persons without liquid assets who are nevertheless sued. This latter group of defendants comprise two large subgroups: holdover tenants (their “asset” is the dwelling they are occupying); and spouses and parents sued for divorce and child custody (one cannot legally end a marriage or establish custody of a child without a court order).</p>
<p id="c0ab6ae7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whatever the measure of need, a range of local, state, and national efforts address it with varying degrees of success. Some of this representation is done by volunteers operating outside a formal organization—lawyers who donate time either as a professional obligation (some bar associations have established minimum amounts of donated time as an obligation of membership) or as a personal act of charity.</p>
<p id="c0ab6ae8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="348" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page348">p. 348</span>At the opposite pole from these individual acts of charity lie the institutions generically referred to as “legal aid.” These organizations get their funding from a combination of tax dollars from several levels of government and private philanthropic support. The largest single source of funding comes from the Legal Services Corporation (LSC), a nonprofit organization established by Congress to award grants to legal assistance organizations across the country. In 2016, LSC had a budget of $388 million, and reported that the agencies it funded served 1,760,000 people and closed 736,400 cases. If one does the arithmetic, that amounts to about $200 per person and $516 per case—not an amount that would permit much in the way of legal services.</p>
<p id="c0ab6ae9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Legal aid offices typically employ lawyers who deliver assistance directly to clients who seek it. These institutions focus on people of small means faced with eviction, creditors’ suits, or domestic violence. They do not take cases that would yield a substantial money recovery, perhaps on the assumption that it is possible to find a lawyer who would take the matter on a contingency basis. Others have argued that such a defensive posture robs legal aid of the ability to challenge the conditions that underlie poverty and oppression in the United States. In the past, such programs have mounted challenges to the existing legal and social order. <i>Evans v. Jeff D</i>., discussed later in this chapter, was financed by legal aid lawyers. Such challenges have sometimes created opposition, especially when publicly subsidized lawyers question some part of the existing political order. In some instances legislatures have responded by trying to limit the kinds of legal work publicly subsidized lawyers can perform for their clients—for example, by forbidding them to sue state and local governments.</p>
<p id="c0ab91fa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If volunteer efforts by individual lawyers mark one end of the spectrum and institutionalized, publicly funded legal aid marks the other, intermediate forms have emerged in recent years that combine features of both systems. In one model, private law firms pledge support, both of money and professional time, to a small organization that functions as a point of client contact and a referral system, matching clients’ needs with available professional services. This enables a relatively small organization to deliver legal services many times greater than its budget. It also enables lawyers and firms to participate in pro bono activities with some assurance that they will get a steady flow of such work and that it will match their legal expertise and capacity. Because such organizations are funded by private donations, they also avoid some of the restrictions on practice that governmentally funded aid encounters.</p>
<p id="c0ab91fb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subsidized legal services formed around a cause—an ethnic, religious, or political group with an agenda for social change—are still another form. The hallmark of such groups is that they solicit funds and memberships with the aim of using those funds to finance litigation that furthers the group’s goals. Such groups have been behind major social impact litigation on a range of issues at both ends of the political spectrum. The most prominent example is undoubtedly Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 443 (1954) (striking down racial segregation in public education), financed largely by the Legal Defense Fund of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, a pioneer civil rights group. Analogous affinity groups have funded litigation seeking to advance agendas of reproductive <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="349" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page349">p. 349</span>rights, environmental causes, and more. In recent decades, groups from the right side of the political spectrum have mounted their own litigation challenges, sometimes seeking to undo or roll back earlier impact litigation. Almost 50 years after <i>Brown</i>, the Supreme Court decided Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244 (2003), striking down a racial preference in admissions for the undergraduate college at the University of Michigan. <i>Gratz</i> was financed by the Center for Individual Rights, an organization describing itself as focusing on “defense of individual liberties against the increasingly aggressive and unchecked authority of” government. http://www.cir-usa.org/mission_new.html, visited August 25, 2018.</p>
<p id="c0ab91fc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, recall that every lawsuit receives some public subsidy: the amounts necessary to maintain the judicial establishment—everything from judges’ salaries to the electricity bill for the courthouse. Each federal district judgeship (including law clerks, secretarial help, and bailiffs) costs in excess of $500,000 annually just in salaries. This amount does not include real estate costs, the central clerk’s office, or general overhead. State judgeships, which are less well supported, would typically have lower costs, but even those costs are substantial. No litigant pays for these direct costs of adjudication. Moreover, the amount of the subsidy falls unevenly. For the great majority of litigants who file a complaint, engage in modest procedural maneuvering, and then settle, the subsidy is small. For litigants who proceed to trial, the subsidy is quite large.</p>

Two proposals are made: to lobby the county supervisors for increased legal aid funding; and to organize a system for referring clients to private firms who volunteer to do pro bono representation.

Contingent fees and insurance spread fees among particular groups of litigants; public subsidies spread costs among all citizens. There are other “spreading” devices that shade into fee shifting.</p>

<p id="c0ab9206-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff brings a lawsuit that benefits him, but in the process also benefits other similarly situated persons. Should those others have an obligation to contribute to the plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees? Yes, said the U.S. Supreme Court in the late nineteenth century, applying what it took to be a basic principle of equity. Trustees v. Greenough, 105 U.S. 527 (1881). The origin of this theory came in a suit in which a bondholder sued the bond issuer to force payment of the bond. The plaintiff had, by vindicating his interest, helped fellow bondholders to win a valuable legal right. The <i>Greenough</i> Court held that the original plaintiff could recover part of his attorney’s fee from the fund that his efforts had created—the sum from which the other bondholders would be paid. Notice that this common fund theory requires that the plaintiff’s efforts create some fund from which the lawyer’s fee can be deducted.</p>
<p id="c0abb917-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This judicially created doctrine has proved very important in financing class actions, in which one party or a few parties may represent a class of many thousands. If in such a case the class representatives win a judgment or settlement for money damages, they regularly seek a contribution to their fees from the fund created for the benefit of the class. Observe that the common fund theory does not itself shift fees from one party to the other; instead it requires that all who benefit from the recovery share its cost. The common fund theory shares fees among similarly situated persons rather than shifting them to the opposing party in a lawsuit.</p>

<p id="c0abb91d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You will likely have seen that the common fund applies only in the former case, because there is no pot of money created by the judgment in the latter. Because the common fund theory depends on a fund created by a judgment or settlement against the adversary, it straddles the line between fee spreading and fee shifting. We turn now to purer forms of fee shifting, in which the losing party pays the winner’s attorneys’ fees. When that happens, the so-called American Rule begins to shade into the English Rule. Since the early 1970s, an increasing amount of U.S. litigation <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="351" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page351">p. 351</span>has involved the possibility for such fee shifting, a circumstance that has in turn created sublitigation about the conditions and circumstances for such shifting. Notice that such systems fall into two groups. In their purest form, such fee shifts are symmetrical; that is, the loser pays the winner’s fees. But some arrangements only allow some categories of winners to recover their fees from their opponents.</p>

<p id="c0abb920-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today a common form of symmetrical fee shifting arises from contractual agreements. Parties to contracts may provide that if litigation over the contract arises, the loser will pay the winner’s legal fees. A lawyer drafting a contract probably commits malpractice if she does not consider such a clause. In theory these provisions may be asymmetrical (tenant pays landlord’s lawyer if evicted; landlord doesn’t have to pay tenant’s lawyer if effort to evict fails), but courts have often interpreted asymmetrical clauses in contracts as symmetrical—loser pays winner’s lawyer. Loan agreements and leases often contain such clauses. When a landlord sues a tenant for rent, the tenant may be ordered to pay both the rent and the fee of the landlord’s lawyer. The reverse would be true if the tenant sued the landlord for constructive eviction. If the tenant’s lease had such a clause, how would it affect her incentives to sue or defend? One often finds such clauses in contracts where the amount in dispute will be relatively small. Do you see why?</p>

<p id="c0abb923-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even when the parties have not agreed to shift fees, there are exceptions to the American Rule. A well-established situation in which one side may pay the other’s legal fee occurs when a plaintiff has groundlessly brought a suit; in most states one element of damages in a subsequent action for malicious prosecution is attorneys’ fees for defending the first suit. Beyond any specific statutory authority lies the inherent power of the court to control behavior designed to thwart the just operation of the legal system. Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32 (1991) (upholding imposition of nearly $1 million in fees on party acting in bad faith). In an influential opinion, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to create a generalized common law doctrine shifting fees in “public interest” cases but said that Congress remained free to do so. Alyeska Pipeline Service v. Wilderness Society, 421 U.S. 240, 257 (1975).</p>

<p id="c0abe036-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Over the past several decades, state and federal legislatures have enthusiastically accepted the invitation in <i>Alyeska</i>. Several hundred federal and several thousand state statutes shift attorneys’ fees in various circumstances. Those “exceptions” to the American Rule have grown so numerous that some have asked if the rule still exists in the country that supplied its name. That assessment stretches things—in the most common forms of litigation, fees will still not shift—but it properly highlights the importance of these statutes.</p>

These statutes cover many topics—mine safety, truth in lending, consumer product safety, endangered species—but among the most important are those concerning civil rights. The basic provision is in 42 U.S.C. §1988(b):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0abe038-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In any action or proceeding to enforce. . . . [various listed federal civil rights statutes]. . . . , the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney’s fee as part of the costs.</p>
</div>
<p id="c0abe039-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statute says a court has “discretion” to award a “prevailing party” fees. Courts have interpreted these terms in ways a casual reader might not suspect. First, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that courts should ordinarily award such fees unless special circumstances render an award unjust—thus sharply limiting the court’s discretion. Blanchard v. Bergeron, 489 U.S. 87 (1989). Second, one might think that the statute created a symmetrical entitlement—that an employee who unsuccessfully sued her employer alleging job discrimination would have to pay the defendant’s legal fees. Not so, held Christianburg Garment Co. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 434 U.S. 412 (1978). In light of the legislative history suggesting that Congress wanted to make it easier, not harder, to enforce civil rights, the <i>Christianburg</i> Court interpreted the statute to permit routine attorneys’ fees awards to prevailing plaintiffs but not to prevailing defendants. A prevailing defendant could get fees only when the plaintiff’s claim was “frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless, or that the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.” Id. at 422. The Supreme Court recently made clear that a defendant can recover fees in a frivolous case resolved in defendant’s favor, regardless of whether dismissal was on the merits. CRST Van Expedited, Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 578 U.S. ___ (2016). Nevertheless, combined, these cases make clear that one-way fee shifting is the rule in civil rights litigation.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0abe03c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider the effect of fee shifting on the filing and conduct of litigation.

How will this affect your estimate of your potential recovery in the case? Can you tell your client, at this moment, that you are no longer interested in representing her? Ethical rules restrict the ability of a lawyer to withdraw from representation for financial reasons to circumstances in which “the representation will result in an unreasonable financial burden on the lawyer.” Model Rule 1.16(a)(5). Losing money on a case in which the lawyer thought he would make money does not qualify as an unreasonable financial burden.</p></li>

Rule 54(d)(2) establishes a procedure for seeking, contesting, and awarding such fees. But most cases will settle before trial. In such cases, the parties can negotiate about fees as well as the portion of the settlement going to the plaintiff. This situation provides an opportunity for the defendant to drive a wedge between lawyer and client, a wedge whose sharpness and power the problem below—based on a seminal Supreme Court case—illustrates.</p>

Wanting to serve the public interest—and maybe get some valuable experience in the process—you volunteer to work on a pro bono case your firm has recently taken on. Your clients are the parents of children with serious developmental disabilities who are cared for in a state institution. The parents seek your firm out because recent work by child psychologists and psychiatrists suggests that, with appropriate treatment, children like these can make far greater educational and social progress than has previously been thought. But the state institution is not giving them such treatment. Federal law gives to all children, including those with special needs, the right to an “appropriate” education. You and your colleagues do research that leads you to believe that the state is failing to provide your clients’ children with such an education and that they have a viable legal claim. It will likely cost a good deal to pursue this claim (involving a good deal of expert testimony), and your clients lack the financial resources to fund the case. The pro bono committee of your firm nevertheless authorizes the representation, in part because if your clients prevail, you will be entitled to recover attorneys’ fees under the provisions of 42 U.S.C. §1988(b) quoted above. Having obtained your clients’ authorization you bring suit in federal district court on their behalf; because there are several hundred parents in the group, you pursue the case as a class action under Rule 23 (more extensively discussed in Chapter 12). The complaint seeks extensive changes in the treatment regime of the children, seeking an injunction that will order those changes. You do not seek damages on behalf of the class. The case progresses, with many motions over the qualifications of various experts, exchanges of reports of experts, depositions, extensive examination of the children’s medical records and more, <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="354" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page354">p. 354</span>all of which consumes substantial amounts of your firm’s time and a considerable amount of money advanced to cover such things as experts’ fees.</p>

Some attorneys have tried through retainer agreements in which their clients promise that they will reject any settlement offer that includes a waiver of fees. But such agreements have been found to be unethical because they restrict a client’s ability to accept or reject settlement offers. Another alternative retainer agreement addresses this issue by providing that a client can accept a settlement that does not include fees but then becomes obligated to pay her attorneys a reasonable fee based on their hourly rate and number of hours spent on the case. Such agreements preserve a client’s ability to accept a settlement offer that waives the entitlement to attorneys’ fees, but imposes significant costs on the client who does so.</p></li>

It allows an award where there is no judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties. . . . A defendant’s voluntary change in conduct, although perhaps accomplishing what the plaintiff sought to achieve by the lawsuit, lacks the necessary judicial imprimatur on the change. . . . </p>
<p id="c0ac558b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners nonetheless argue that the legislative history of the Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees Awards Act supports a broad reading of “prevailing party” which includes the “catalyst theory.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c0ac558c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think the legislative history cited by petitioners is at best ambiguous as to the availability of the “catalyst theory” for awarding attorney’s fees. Particularly in view of the “American Rule” that attorney’s fees will not be awarded absent “explicit statutory authority,” such legislative history is clearly insufficient to alter the accepted meaning of the statutory term. . . . </p>

They also claim that the rejection of the “catalyst theory” will deter plaintiffs with meritorious but expensive cases from bringing suit. We are skeptical of these assertions, which are entirely speculative and unsupported by any empirical evidence.</p>
<p id="c0ac558e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners discount the disincentive that the “catalyst theory” may have upon a defendant’s decision to voluntarily change its conduct, conduct that may not be illegal. “The defendant’s potential liability for fees in this kind of litigation can be as significant as, and sometimes even more significant than, their potential liability on the merits,” <i>Evans v. Jeff D</i>., and the possibility of being assessed attorney’s fees may well deter a defendant from altering its conduct.</p>
<p id="c0ac7c9f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And petitioners’ fear of mischievous defendants only materializes in claims for equitable relief, for so long as the plaintiff has a cause of action for damages, a defendant’s change in conduct will not moot the case. . . . <span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10D10_d543d88a-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10D10_d543d88a-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">10</a></span> We have also stated that “[a] request for attorney’s fees should not result in a second major litigation,” and have accordingly avoided an interpretation of the fee-shifting statutes that would have “spawn[ed] a second litigation of significant dimension.” Among other things, a “catalyst theory” hearing would require analysis of the defendant’s subjective motivations in changing its conduct, an analysis that “will likely depend on a highly factbound inquiry and may turn on reasonable inferences from the nature and timing of the defendant’s change in conduct.”  . . . </p>

<p id="c0ac7ca5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my view, the “catalyst rule,” as applied by the clear majority of Federal Circuits, is a key component of the fee-shifting statutes Congress adopted to advance enforcement of civil rights.

When parties reach that conclusion (and the plaintiffs want the long-term behavior of the defendants to remain as agreed), they sometimes enter into a consent decree, in which the court orders the parties to do what they have already agreed to do. If that had been the end of <i>Buckhannon</i>, would the plaintiffs have been able to collect attorneys’ fees under the Court’s decision?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0aca3ba-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If so, does it make sense that they cannot collect those fees if the way the State “gives up” is to repeal the offending legislation?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0aca3bb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A broader way of asking the preceding question is to ask whether it makes sense to have a rule conditioning attorneys’ fees on “judicial imprimatur” in a world in which most cases do not end through judicial action. Most cases end through private settlement agreements, which do not qualify the plaintiffs for fees under §1988. This is true even though settlements will often reflect the law that will be applied if the case was adjudicated.</p></li>

Contract cases dominate the civil docket, and more than half of them are actions to collect debts. A is wrong because filings have been flat or decreased in recent years. C is wrong because substantially more contract than tort claims are filed. D is wrong because about 98 percent of civil litigation occurs in state courts.</p>
<p id="c0ad1815-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q2.</b> B and C are the only correct responses. A is wrong because trials, much less jury trials, will occur only in a small minority of cases. D is wrong because the average case in which the plaintiff prevails results—for both torts and bench-tried contract claims—in judgments between $10,000 and $50,000.</p>
<p id="c0ad1816-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q3.</b> B is the only correct answer; such parties will typically pay their own lawyers (unless the contract in question calls for the loser to pay the winner’s fee). A is wrong because almost all such cases will involve a contingent fee lawyer representing the plaintiff and an insurer-paid lawyer representing the defendant. C is wrong because a fee-shifting statute will give fees to a prevailing plaintiff. D is wrong because under the common fund theory, the plaintiff’s lawyer will collect his fee from the award that will be distributed to the plaintiff class.</p>
<p id="c0ad1817-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q4.</b> B and C are the correct responses. A is wrong because the quoted formula is ancient law jargon contending that the “legal"—meaning available at common law—remedies are inadequate and the court should therefore exercise its equitable powers. Along with those powers comes the court’s duty to consider not only the parties’ interests but those of the public. See <i>Lucy Webb Hayes Natl. Training School v. Geoghegan</i> (supra page 308) and <i>Winter v. NRDC</i> (supra page 316).</p>

B is not correct because, though the federal fee-shifting statute reads as if it contemplated a loser pays winner regime, it has been consistently interpreted to mean that a prevailing plaintiff can collect fees from the defendant, but a prevailing defendant cannot collect from the plaintiff (unless the court finds that the plaintiff’s claim was in bad faith). C is incorrect because a fee award requires a judgment; settlement or a change of position by defendant is not enough. <i>Buckhannon</i> (supra page 355). Note, however, that the settlement provisions may provide for a fee to the lawyer, or the plaintiff may pay her lawyer from settlement proceeds.</p>
<p id="c0ad1819-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q6.</b> C is the only correct response. In A and B there will be notice, as well as a hearing—although a truncated one. D is wrong because the courts do allow temporary restraining orders to be issued without notice, though only in the sorts of extreme circumstances contemplated in Rule 65(b).</p>
<p id="c0ad181a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q7.</b> B is the only correct response. A is wrong because even when due process does apply, it often requires only the opportunity for a hearing, which will occur only if asked for. C is wrong because, although due process does require the uniform application of procedures, it also requires that the procedures be fundamentally fair—not just that they be uniform. D is spectacularly wrong: The hallmark of the modern Due Process Clause is its flexibility—what process is “due” depends to an extraordinary degree on the circumstances of the case.</p>

Procedural due process is not intended to promote efficiency or accommodate all possible interests: it is intended to protect the particular interests of the person whose possessions are about to be taken.</p>

But the Constitution recognizes higher values than speed and efficiency. Indeed, one might fairly say of the Bill of Rights in general, and the Due Process Clause in particular, that they were designed to protect the fragile values of a vulnerable citizenry from the overbearing concern for efficiency and efficacy that may characterize praiseworthy government officials no less, and perhaps more, than mediocre ones.</p>

In three cases, the Court has allowed the attachment of property without a prior hearing. In one, the attachment was necessary to protect the public against the same sort of immediate harm involved in the seizure cases—a bank failure. Coffin Bros. &amp; Co. v. Bennett, 277 U.S. 29. Another case involved attachment necessary to secure jurisdiction in state court—clearly a most basic and important public interest. Ownbey v. Morgan, 256 U.S. 94. It is much less clear what interests were involved in the third case, decided with an unexplicated per curiam opinion simply citing <i>Coffin Bros.</i> and <i>Ownbey</i>. McKay v.

<p id="c0b4440c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our system depends on the parties to move lawsuits forward. Pleadings—the ­plaintiff’s complaint and the defendant’s response to that complaint—constitute the first steps. Eighty years ago, the bulk of a course in civil procedure would have consisted of learning the special formulas necessary to bring thirty or so kinds of claims, each of which had a special, formulaic pleading associated with it. Today, for reasons you’ll soon see, pleading again stands on center stage, with some claiming that recent judicial interpretations of the Rules have thrown pleading, and, with it, the entire litigation system, into disarray. This chapter aims to describe the changing role of pleading, its current functions, and the sources of the present uncertainty.</p>
<p id="c0b4440d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Let’s start with basics: What <i>is</i> a “pleading”? Rule 7(a) defines that term to include the complaint, the answer, and some other initial papers in a lawsuit. Rule 7(b) distinguishes between “pleadings” and “motions,” the latter term used to describe any “request for a court order.” But, to make things a bit more challenging, sometimes lawyers or judges will describe the “pleading stage” of a lawsuit to include both the papers formally defined as pleadings <i>and</i> various motions challenging the sufficiency of the pleadings. This chapter will deal with both.</p>

They allow the opposing party—via motions—to ask the court to provide rough blueprints for the next steps in litigation. In contemporary practice, pleadings also open the door to the very powerful tools of discovery explored in the next chapter. That’s a lot to expect from an initial exchange of documents, and sometimes they fail in one or all of these functions. Moreover, these functions sometimes work at cross-purposes with one another, and the common law system has over the past millennium emphasized now one, now another of these functions.</p>

<p id="c0b49248-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>The Court of Common Pleas, Depicted in a Fifteenth-Century Manuscript</b></p>
<p id="c0b49249-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The king’s greeting to the sheriff provides one example. In medieval England right after the Norman Conquest (in 1066), royal justice (administered by the king, his sheriffs and judges) was special, something extraordinary. Ordinary cases were to be dealt with in local courts and would not involve royal officials. Plaintiffs who wanted to get royal justice—and many did because it quickly gained a reputation as fairer, faster, and generally more efficacious—had to take two steps. First, they had to convince the royal officials that the case was one that warranted royal justice. In early medieval times, this question was debated. Everyone agreed that the royal courts should attend to allegations of breaches of the peace—what today we might call violent crime. Even as royal justice extended to more <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="364" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page364">p. 364</span>"peaceful” forms of unlawfulness—failure to pay debts, breach of contract, and negligent injury—the pleadings retained the flavor of outrage. The defendant has not merely failed to keep his word or pay his debt; he has made things worse. Can you see this in the first pleading?</p>
<p id="c0b4924a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second thing the plaintiff seeking royal justice had to do was to pay for it. Administering justice was a source of income to the crown, and a plaintiff wanting access to the royal courts had to pay. The writ issued only when the fee was paid, and the “greeting” to the sheriff was also an assurance that the royal coffers had received the right number of shillings—what we would call today a filing fee—from the plaintiff.</p>
<p id="c0b4924b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another striking characteristic of medieval royal justice was that—except in cases involving land—there was no such thing as a default judgment: The defendant had to appear for the court to proceed further. Defendants who thought they might lose were understandably reluctant to appear, and so early common law procedure devoted much effort to “encouraging” them to appear. The first stage was, as now, for the sheriff to summon them, and to require that they give him some assurance that they would show up on the date set for trial. The complaint sets the “octave of St. Michael,” the week after the feast of St. Michael, on September 29, as the time when the defendant should appear before “us,” meaning not the king (though in the Middle Ages the king himself occasionally heard lawsuits) but the royal justices. Defendants assured their appearance in court by two means—by posting what we would now call a bond, called a “gage” (bail bonds are still common in criminal cases, where they assure that defendant will appear) as well as by supplying persons, known as “pledges,” who would personally promise to assure defendant’s appearance. The writ above thus refers to “gages and safe pledges.”</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0b4924c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider now the modern pleading. It is addressed to the court, not to the sheriff, and, because we now have default judgments, it omits gages, pledges, and the like. On the other hand, it begins with a recitation of the state citizenship of the two parties, something that seems quite peripheral to the question of whether Jones’s negligence caused Smith’s injuries.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0b4924d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In fact, that allegation is analogous to the king’s greeting to the sheriff: It establishes the court’s jurisdiction. Twenty-first-century federal courts are like medieval royal courts in one respect: They have limited jurisdiction. One basis for that jurisdiction is “diversity of citizenship,” defined in the Constitution and in 28 U.S.C. §1332, to which the complaint refers. Note that state court complaints do not generally include a jurisdictional statement as they, in contrast to federal courts, are courts of general jurisdiction—meaning that they can hear all cases, unless a provision of state or federal law restricts their jurisdiction.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b4924e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the medieval complaint was focused on getting the defendant to appear, the modern one seems more concerned with the other end of the lawsuit—the nature of injuries and amount of damages claimed by the plaintiff. As we’ll see, this “factuality” and a focus on remedies are hallmarks of modern lawsuits.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b4b95f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="365" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page365">p. 365</span>The ingredients of a modern complaint are relatively straightforward. Rule 8(a) contains the recipe—a recitation of the basis for jurisdiction, a “short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,” and “a demand for judgment for the relief sought.” The modern recipe is simple. But just as it is deceptively simple to say that a recipe for a soufflé involves only a sauce and some eggs, drafting a complaint requires a bit of art; for most of the rest of this chapter, we’ll see instances in which lawyers managed to mess up the recipe and what consequences flowed from their mistakes.</p></li>

<p id="c0b4b962-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before we go further, keep firmly in mind that the process of pleading, like civil litigation generally, involves <i>competitive</i> storytelling. The plaintiff has his tale of woe and outrage, but the defendant typically has a very different version of the events, suggesting that the plaintiff’s story is wrong in one of several ways. By far the most common defendant’s response, contained in the defendant’s first pleading, called the “answer,” has been the same for centuries: “I didn’t do it” or “That’s not what happened.” At common law this defense was known as a “traverse” (derived from the Latin sense of “running against"); today it’s known as a denial, and finds expression in Rule 8(b).</p>
<p id="c0b4b963-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But both common law and modern procedure offer a set of more technical, “legal” responses. We’ll meet most of them in the course of this chapter. Some have to do with the power of the court to hear the case, others with some defect in the way the plaintiff commenced the lawsuit. Rule 12(b) lists a series of such defenses and allows a defendant to assert each as a motion. These motions all have one important feature in common: They do not require the defendant to say whether the allegations of the complaint are true. Instead, they state that the case has some other defect that should cause the court to dismiss it before the defendant has to answer.</p>
<p id="c0b4b964-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of the more powerful Rule 12(b) motions essentially says that the plaintiff’s “story” doesn’t matter—doesn’t matter because the plaintiff has not told one of the stories that would allow a court to grant a legal remedy. For example, suppose defendant promised to come to plaintiff’s party, but failed to show up. However unhappy the disappointed host may be, that story is not one that will cause a court to award damages or other remedy. It’s different if the defendant is the caterer and contracted to supply food, but against the invited guest who decides the weather is too bad to attend, the law provides no remedy.</p>
<p id="c0b4b965-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This motion—plaintiff’s story doesn’t matter, or “so what?"—had the name at common law, and still in some state procedural codes, of “demurrer” (from Latin and French words meaning “delay"); the Rules call this a 12(b)(6) motion. It does two things. First, it admits, for the purposes of the motion, all the facts alleged in the complaint: So if, as in the party invitation example, the plaintiff alleges that he suffered great emotional distress when the defendant failed to show up, a defendant’s 12(b)(6) motion admits that distress for the purposes of the motion. Second, the 12(b)(6) motion says that <i>even if all the facts alleged are true</i>, the law grants plaintiff no legal remedy—a fancier way of saying that plaintiff’s story doesn’t matter legally. So when a defendant demurs to a complaint (or, under the Rules, files a 12(b)(6) motion), the question facing the court is whether, assuming the pleaded facts are <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="366" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page366">p. 366</span>true, the law provides any remedy. The first several cases in this chapter involve 12(b)(6) motions—and the issue is why the law provides a remedy (or why it doesn’t), assuming plaintiff can prove what he alleges—and what the decision of that question tells us about the rules and principles of modern pleading.</p>

And the plaintiff has obviously supplied a good deal more detail than you might guess from reading the “short and plain statement” requirement of Rule 8(a). Why?</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0b555d9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Part of the answer lies in the role of pleading as storytelling. A pleader who has a good story will want to tell it, even if no Rule or case compels him to. This additional detail will show the strengths of the case to the trial judge deciding the case, the defendants, and even, perhaps, the press.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b555da-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, this is a case in which many relevant facts will be known to the plaintiff. (Not all: Haddle will have no idea what might have been said about him in discussions of his job performance among defendants.) Since he knows part of the story, why not tell it in a way that puts him in the most attractive—and the defendants in the least attractive—light possible?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b555db-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Haddle has an intuitively attractive story: As he sees it, he was just trying to do the right thing—cooperating with a government investigation of criminal activity—and was fired for it. But not all attractive stories constitute legal claims.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0b555dc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some states recognize “wrongful discharge” claims; an employee alleging that she was fired without good cause states a wrongful discharge claim.

<li class=""><p id="c0b555dd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So Haddle’s lawyer had to look elsewhere. He started with a statute enacted in the wake of the Civil War and aimed at those who sought to intimidate newly freed former slaves by preventing them from using courts to enforce newly granted rights. That statute, now codified as 42 U.S.C. §1985(2), provides:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">

<li class=""><p id="c0b57cf2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants had a special reason for wanting to avoid a “swearing contest” (so called because witnesses are under oath): In the time since the complaint was filed Jeanette Garrison had pleaded guilty to federal felony charges. If defendants go to trial, they will be asking the jury to believe the testimony of a criminal in a case where, on cross-examination, the plaintiff will be able to introduce the following testimony from Jeanette Garrison before the U.S. Senate Committee on Aging:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">

<li class=""><p id="c0b57cf6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As already noted, the statute requires a conspiracy by two or more persons; clearly Haddle’s complaint meets those criteria.</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0b57cf8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the statute grants a remedy to the party injured “in his person or property.”</p></li>

Haddle did not have an employment contract for a specific term. Based on the preceding analysis, defense counsel constructed an argument for the defendants that—however unadmirable their actions may have been—those actions did not violate §1985(2).</p></li>

A motion under Rule 12(b)(6) attacks the legal sufficiency of the complaint. In essence, the movant says, “Even if everything you allege is true, the law affords you no relief.” Consequently, in determining the merits of a 12(b)(6) motion, a court <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="372" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page372">p. 372</span>must assume that all of the factual allegations of the complaint are true.

Is it possible that the concession the district court refers to was made somewhere other than in the complaint itself? Imagine oral argument on the motion to dismiss, at which the judge asked Haddle’s lawyer if he was contending that his client had some form of protected employment. The lawyer says no.

Explain why, in such a scenario, the district court could not have granted a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).

<li class=""><p id="c0b5f24d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In both state and federal courts, when a complaint fails to state a claim, the court will almost always allow the plaintiff “leave to amend"—meaning a chance to add allegations to the complaint that would render it valid. If the plaintiff seeks leave, and if the court denies it, an appellate court will likely reverse on the grounds that failure to grant leave to amend the complaint is an abuse of discretion.</p>

That’s very likely because Haddle’s lawyer did not seek such leave—because he thought that he had already pleaded all the facts he truthfully could, and it would thus be futile to try to amend the complaint.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b5f24f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, if the court had granted leave to amend, Haddle’s lawyer could have added allegations that his contract stated he would not be dismissed except for good cause.

<p id="c0b6196b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Michael A. Haddle appeals following the district court’s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. §1985(2) claim for failure to state a claim. We conclude that Haddle’s arguments on appeal are foreclosed by this court’s decision in Morast v. Lance, 807 F.2d 926 (11th Cir. 1987). The judgment of the district court is therefore affirmed.</p>

In recent years, the federal courts have disposed of about 250,000 civil cases annually. The district court dismissal would count as one of those cases. A losing litigant has the right to appeal that loss to a U.S. Court of Appeals. In recent years, the federal Courts of Appeals have disposed of about 55,000 appeals each year; the per curiam affirmance of <i>Haddle v. Garrison</i> would count as one of those cases. A litigant who has lost in a Court of Appeals in an ordinary civil case does not have the <i>right</i> to have his case heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. He may petition for a writ of certiorari, which the Supreme Court may grant if it believes the question presented is important enough.

<p id="c0b66799-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner Michael A. Haddle, an at-will employee, alleges that respondents conspired to have him fired from his job in retaliation for obeying a federal grand jury subpoena and to deter him from testifying at a federal criminal trial. We hold that such interference with at-will employment may give rise to a claim for damages under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, Rev. Stat. §1980, 42 U.S.C. §1985(2).</p>
<p id="c0b6679a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to petitioner’s complaint, a federal grand jury indictment in March 1995 charged petitioner’s employer, Healthmaster, Inc., and respondents Jeanette Garrison and Dennis Kelly, officers of Healthmaster, with Medicare fraud. Petitioner cooperated with the federal agents in the investigation that preceded the indictment. He also appeared to testify before the grand jury pursuant to a subpoena, but did not testify due to the press of time. Petitioner was also expected to appear as a witness in the criminal trial resulting from the indictment.</p>
<p id="c0b6679b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although Garrison and Kelly were barred by the Bankruptcy Court from participating in the affairs of Healthmaster, they conspired with G. Peter Molloy, Jr., one of the remaining officers of Healthmaster, to bring about petitioner’s termination. They did this both to intimidate petitioner and to retaliate against him for his attendance at the federal-court proceedings.</p>
<p id="c0b6679c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner sued for damages in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, asserting a federal claim under 42 U.S.C. §1985(2) and various state-law claims. Petitioner stated two grounds for relief under §1985(2): one for conspiracy to deter him from testifying in the upcoming criminal trial and one for conspiracy to retaliate against him for attending the grand jury proceedings. As §1985 demands, he also alleged that he had been “injured in his person or property” by the acts of respondents in violation of §1985(2) and that he was entitled to recover his damages occasioned by such injury against respondents jointly and severally.</p>
<p id="c0b6679d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Because petitioner conceded that he was an at-will employee, the District Court granted the motion on the authority of Morast v. Lance, 807 F.2d 926 (1987). In <i>Morast</i>, the Eleventh Circuit held that an at-will employee who is dismissed pursuant to a conspiracy proscribed by §1985(2) has no cause of action. The <i>Morast</i> court <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="376" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page376">p. 376</span>explained that “to make out a cause of action under §1985(2) the plaintiff must have suffered an actual injury. Because Morast was an at-will employee, he had no constitutionally protected interest in continued employment. Therefore, Morast’s discharge did not constitute an actual injury under this statute.” Relying on its decision in <i>Morast</i>, the Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>
<p id="c0b6679e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Eleventh Circuit’s rule in <i>Morast</i> conflicts with the holdings of the First and Ninth Circuits. We therefore granted certiorari, to decide whether petitioner was “injured in his property or person” when respondents induced his employer to terminate petitioner’s at-will employment as part of a conspiracy prohibited by §1985(2).</p>
<p id="c0b6679f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statute provides that if one or more persons engaged in such a conspiracy “do, or cause to be done, any act in furtherance of the object of such conspiracy, whereby another is injured in his person or property,. . . . the party so injured. . . . may have an action for the recovery of damages occasioned by such injury. . . . against any one or more of the conspirators.” §1985(3).</p>
<p id="c0b667a0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner’s action was dismissed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) because, in the Eleventh Circuit’s view, he had not suffered an injury that could give rise to a claim for damages under §1985(2). We must, of course, assume that the facts as alleged in petitioner’s complaint are true and that respondents engaged in a conspiracy prohibited by §1985(2). Our review in this case is accordingly confined to one question: Can petitioner state a claim for damages by alleging that a conspiracy proscribed by §1985(2) induced his employer to terminate his at-will employment.</p>
<p id="c0b667a1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We disagree with the Eleventh Circuit’s conclusion that petitioner must suffer an injury to a “constitutionally protected property interest” to state a claim for damages under §1985(2). Nothing in the language or purpose of the proscriptions in the first clause of §1985(2), nor in its attendant remedial provisions, establishes such a requirement. The gist of the wrong at which §1985(2) is directed is not deprivation of property, but intimidation or retaliation against witnesses in federal-court proceedings. The terms “injured in his person or property” define the harm that the victim may suffer as a result of the conspiracy to intimidate or retaliate. Thus, the fact that employment at will is not “property” for purposes of the Due Process Clause, does not mean that loss of at-will employment may not “injur[e] [petitioner] in his person or property” for purposes of §1985(2).</p>
<p id="c0b667a2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We hold that the sort of harm alleged by petitioner here—essentially third-party interference with at-will employment relationships—states a claim for relief under §1985(2). Such harm has long been a compensable injury under tort law, and we see no reason to ignore this tradition in this case. As Thomas Cooley recognized:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0b68eb3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One who maliciously and without justifiable cause, induces an employer to discharge an employee, by means of false statements, threats or putting in fear, or perhaps by means of malevolent advice and persuasion, is liable in an action of tort to the employee for the damages thereby sustained. <i>And it makes no difference whether the employment was for a fixed term not yet expired or is terminable at the will of the employer</i>.</p>

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0b68eb6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The fact that the employment is at the will of the parties, respectively, does not make it one at the will of others. The employee has manifest interest in the freedom of the employer to exercise his judgment without illegal interference or compulsion and, by the weight of authority, the unjustified interference of third persons is actionable although the employment is at will.</p>
</div>
<p id="c0b68eb7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The kind of interference with at-will employment relations alleged here is merely a species of the traditional torts of intentional interference with contractual relations and intentional interference with prospective contractual relations. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §766, Comment g, pp. 10-11 (1977); see also id., §766B, Comment c, at 22. This protection against third-party interference with at-will employment relations is still afforded by state law today. See W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keaton on Law of Torts §129, pp. 995-996, and n. 83 (5th ed. 1984) (citing cases). For example, the State of Georgia, where the acts underlying the complaint in this case took place, provides a cause of action against third parties for wrongful interference with employment relations.</p>
<p id="c0b68eb8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, to the extent that the terms “injured in his person or property” in §1985 refer to principles of tort law, see 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 118 (1768) (describing the universe of common law torts as “all private wrongs, or civil injuries, which may be offered to the rights of either a man’s person or his property"), we find ample support for our holding that the harm occasioned by the conspiracy here may give rise to a claim for damages under §1985(2).</p>
<p id="c0b68eb9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

<li><p id="c0b68ebc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In deciding that Haddle’s complaint did state a claim, the Supreme Court also defines the content of the substantive law involved.</p></li>
<li><p id="c0b68ebd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In doing so, the Court interprets the meaning of “property” and “injury” in 42 U.S.C. §1985(2).</p></li>
<li><p id="c0b68ebe-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In that respect, <i>Haddle</i> is a classic example of common law development: a statute with some clear applications; a set of facts not within the clear applications; and a judicial opinion stating how the statute applies to this new set of facts.

<p id="c0b6b5da-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A U.S. District Court jury sided with Michael Haddle on Friday afternoon, finding his former bosses fired him for helping uncover corporate crimes that cost taxpayers more than $10 million. But in the same verdict, the jury awarded Mr. Haddle just $65,000 in compensatory damages against Jeannette Garrison, founder and owner of the now-defunct Healthmaster Inc., the company, and her corporate legal counsel and top executive, G. Peter Molloy. “You won again,” defense attorney David Hudson told Mrs. Garrison after the jury verdict was announced at the conclusion of a five-day federal court trial. The low amount of damages left the defense team in smiles, extremely pleased with the jury’s decision about damages. But they still intend to challenge the verdict, Mr. Hudson said. Afterward, Mr. Haddle smiled, too. “I’m pleased with the verdict. It vindicated me. “Sometimes those things are more important than money.”</p>
</div>
<p id="c0b6b5db-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The article went on to report that the verdict was several hundred thousand dollars less than plaintiff had sought.

As you saw in Chapter 1, there are several other procedural moments that require a court to set forth the law: motions for summary judgment and judgments as a matter of law, jury instructions—and more. The 12(b)(6) motion is the first of these moments and has some special characteristics. Notably, a court ruling on a 12(b)(6) motion is uncontaminated by disputed facts. It has the allegations in the complaint, but these are only allegations, and any judge worth her salt <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="380" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page380">p. 380</span>understands that the defendant will deny many of these allegations in the answer and contest them in ensuing stages of litigation.

That toll is worth its price if a suit has merit; if, that is, events have occurred for which the law grants a remedy. If, on the other hand, the suit has no merit because the plaintiff cannot show that the events alleged actually occurred, then the toll of litigation seems excessive. Suppose it were possible to tell from the face of a complaint whether it would ultimately fail: Would it not be a good thing to put such a lawsuit out of its misery at the earliest possible moment?</p>

At common law, say from 1100 <span class="epub-small-caps">c.e</span>. to the mid-nineteenth century, pleading was in one respect easy: One simply recited the formula for one of the “approved” 30-odd writs, each of which came both with its required allegations and with its own mode of proof. In common law, pleadings problems arose when the pleader tried to prove something that didn’t exactly match the allegations of the pleading. Suppose, for example, that, having pleaded a claim of having injured his horse, our medieval John Smith then wanted to prove something a bit more subtle: that the blacksmith had promised “first-class work” (or whatever its Middle English equivalent would be) but that the horse was lamed when the shoe fell off after just one day’s riding. Could Smith make that proof having pleaded something else? (The answer mattered a lot because if Smith had pleaded what we would think of as a breach of warranty claim, the defendant Jones would not have to go before a jury, but could defend himself by showing up with a sufficient number of “oath-helpers,” who would, perhaps for the price of tankard of ale, swear that Jones had done good work—and that would be the end of the claim.) Locked into the writs’ formulae, weak complaints were impossible to distinguish from strong ones before trial.</p>
<p id="c0b6b5e6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In reaction to this problem, the great pleading reform of the nineteenth century was to junk the writs and to ask pleaders to state “facts.” This result was achieved by “the Field Codes,” legislation adopted in many states under the inspiration of David Dudley Field, an influential mid-century lawyer. These Codes directed pleaders to state “facts constituting a cause of action.” One of the <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="381" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page381">p. 381</span>hopes was that the facts thus recited would enable courts to distinguish early on between strong and weak cases. What could possibly go wrong? Plenty, it turned out. Most saliently for our purposes, courts could not agree what a “fact” was. Some complaints failed because the pleaders recounted excessive detail, each event that might be relevant; courts dismissed these complaints because they contained “mere evidence.” Other complaints failed because they erred in the opposite direction, reciting their allegations at a level of generality condemned as “legal conclusions.”</p>

<p id="c0b6b5e9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The drafters of the Federal Rules took a quite different approach to sorting weak from strong cases. Abandoning the effort to do this at the pleading stage (except for the rare complaint whose allegations failed to state a claim for relief—with which a 12(b)(6) motion would deal), the Rules put the sorting function in the next stage of litigation. In the discovery phase, the thinking went, the plaintiff would dismiss or quickly settle cases with no factual foundation, or would succumb when defendant moved for summary judgment. Under this approach, the basic requirements for complaints could be quite simple:</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0b6dd05-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have already discussed the requirements of Rule 8(a)(1), setting out the basis for the federal court’s subject matter jurisdiction. See Note 2, page 364.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b6dd06-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now consider Rule 8(a)(2). The Rule requires only a “short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” The drafters and subsequent revisers of the Rules appear to have assumed that the details of the claim would be unearthed in discovery and sorted out at summary judgment or trial. To better understand this long-held view about the limited role of pleadings as an obstacle, read or re-read <i>Bell v. Novick Transfer Co.</i> at page 19. The court in that case held that the plaintiff’s complaint did not need to allege more than that the car he was riding in was struck by a car owned by Defendants, and that it was operated “in a careless, reckless and negligent manner. . . . so that” the plaintiff was injured. The court refused to dismiss the complaint for failing to allege defendants’ negligence with specificity, reasoning that the details of the claim could be learned during discovery.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0b6dd07-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notice that the brevity and conclusory nature of complaints under the Rules will sometimes leave the defendant largely in the dark about the details of plaintiff’s case. In <i>Bell</i>, the defendant surely wanted to know what kind of negligence the plaintiff was asserting: Did he run a light, fail to stop, have faulty brakes? Did plaintiff think he was drunk, not wearing the glasses required by his driver’s license, or something else? The complaint did not say, and the decision did not require him to say.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b6dd08-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This brevity can also benefit plaintiffs. Plaintiffs may be happy to tell their story in all its gory details—if they know it. But plaintiffs may not know all the facts at the start of the suit, or they may not be sure which version of the story they want to try to prove, and, of course, some of the “facts” they allege may turn out not to be true. Plaintiff will not know, before discovery, whether the defendant acted negligently because he had faulty brakes or was drunk. Accordingly, plaintiffs will sometimes favor briefer, sketchier recitations of the facts.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b6dd09-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For decades, the Supreme Court interpreted Rule 8 to endorse the conclusory brevity considered acceptable by the trial court in <i>Bell</i>. Until recently, the leading Supreme Court case was Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957):</p>

Here, the complaint alleged, in part, that petitioners were discharged wrongfully by the Railroad and that the Union, acting according to plan, refused to protect their jobs as it did those of white employees or to help them with their grievances all because they were Negroes. If these allegations are proven there has <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="383" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page383">p. 383</span>been a manifest breach of the Union’s statutory duty to represent fairly [all its members]. . . . </p>

To the contrary, all the Rules require is “a short and plain statement of the claim” that will give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff’s claim is and the grounds upon which it rests. . . . Such simplified “notice pleading” is made possible by the liberal opportunity for discovery and the other pretrial procedures established by the Rules to disclose more precisely the basis of both claim and defense and to define more narrowly the disputed facts and issues. Following the simple guide of Rule 8([e]) that “[pleadings must be construed so as to do justice,]”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN105DD_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N105DD_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*2</a></span> we have no doubt that petitioners’ complaint adequately set forth a claim and gave the respondents fair notice of its basis. The Federal Rules reject the approach that pleading is a game of skill in which one misstep by counsel may be decisive to the outcome and accept the principle that the purpose of pleading is to facilitate a proper decision on the merits.</p>

</ol>
<p id="c0b6dd0d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The corollary of the choice expressed in Rule 8 and <i>Conley</i>—endorsing brief and conclusory pleadings—is that discovery, not pleading, will do the major sorting between grounded and ungrounded claims. But deferring this sorting function until discovery has costs, for litigants and for the system as a whole. Good data on the costs of discovery is hard to come by, but in some cases discovery will be a major expense. Worse, a defendant who prevails and gets plaintiff’s claim dismissed will still have to pay the costs of discovery and defense. For some plaintiffs, on the other hand, discovery represents the only tool that will uncover evidence of a defendant’s liability. The Rules’ choice of what is sometimes called “notice pleading” thus represents a fundamental decision: It opens the doors of discovery to some complaints that may not prevail, recognizing that doing so will impose costs on the defendants in such cases. For many years, the Supreme Court stood by this interpretation of Rule 8, with the entailed allocation of costs and risks. Yet, within the past 15 years, the U.S. Supreme Court has twice reconsidered this issue, in the process working what some believe to be a fundamental shift in the landscape of modern litigation.</p>
<p id="c0b6dd0e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first step came in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007). <i>Twombly</i> represents one kind of case in which a complaint that turns out to be factually ungrounded will be expensive and time-consuming: an antitrust action. The federal antitrust laws forbid price fixing. So, if five widget manufacturers meet in a hotel room and decide they will all charge $5 per widget, they have thereby subjected themselves both to criminal penalties and civil liability. What, though, if they do not meet but just keep an eye on each other’s prices (as all business competitors do), and all, without any overt agreement, hit on $5 as the right price? As the Supreme Court has interpreted the antitrust statutes, such a situation, which antitrust lawyers call “parallel conduct,” does not create liability. But, of course, because those <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="384" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page384">p. 384</span>who have made unlawful agreements want to keep them secret, one can sometimes infer conspiracy from parallel conduct <i>plus</i> some other circumstances. (In antitrust jargon, this is termed “parallelism plus.") To make things harder, the courts have held that conclusory allegations of a conspiracy do not suffice; the plaintiff must allege some facts leading to the inference of an unlawful agreement. The problem is that the fact of parallel behavior could be either evidence leading to an inference of conspiracy <i>or</i> innocent “parallelism.” And many thousands of hours of discovery may be necessary to find out which of these scenarios is closer to the truth.</p>
<p id="c0b7031f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Twombly</i>, the Supreme Court said that it was going to head the complaint off at the pass. In so doing it re-interpreted <i>Conley v. Gibson</i>:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0b70320-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In applying the[] general standards [of Rule 8] to a[n antitrust] claim, we hold that stating such a claim requires a complaint with enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest that an agreement was made. . . . </p>
<p id="c0b70321-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We alluded to the practical significance of the Rule 8 entitlement requirement in Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, when we explained that something beyond the mere possibility of loss causation must be alleged, lest a plaintiff with “’a largely groundless claim’” be allowed to “’take up the time of a number of other people, with the right to do so representing an <i>in terrorem</i> increment of the settlement value.’”  . . . </p>
<p id="c0b70322-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, it is one thing to be cautious before dismissing an antitrust complaint in advance of discovery, but quite another to forget that proceeding to antitrust discovery can be expensive. As we indicated over 20 years ago in Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 528 n.17 (1983), “a district court must retain the power to insist upon some specificity in pleading before allowing a potentially massive factual controversy to proceed.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c0b70323-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs do not, of course, dispute the requirement of plausibility and the need for something more than merely parallel behavior. . . . , and their main argument against the plausibility standard at the pleading stage is its ostensible conflict with an early statement of ours construing Rule 8. Justice Black’s opinion for the Court in <i>Conley v. Gibson</i> spoke not only of the need for fair notice of the grounds for entitlement to relief but of “the accepted rule that a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.” This “no set of facts” language can be read in isolation as saying that any statement revealing the theory of the claim will suffice unless its factual impossibility may be shown from the face of the pleadings; and the Court of Appeals appears to have read <i>Conley</i> in some such way when formulating its understanding of the proper pleading standard. . . . It seems fair to say that this approach to pleading would dispense with any showing of a “reasonably founded hope” that a plaintiff would be able to make a case; Mr. Micawber’s optimism would be enough.</p>
<p id="c0b70324-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Seeing this, a good many judges and commentators have balked at taking the literal terms of the <i>Conley</i> passage as a pleading standard. [The Court then cites several cases holding this view.]</p>
<p id="c0b70325-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We could go on, but there is no need to pile up further citations to show that <i>Conley</i>’s “no set of facts” language has been questioned, criticized, and explained away long enough. To be fair to the <i>Conley</i> Court, the passage should be understood in light of the opinion’s preceding summary of the complaint’s concrete allegations, which the <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="385" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page385">p. 385</span>Court quite reasonably understood as amply stating a claim for relief. But the passage so often quoted fails to mention this understanding on the part of the Court, and after puzzling the profession for 50 years, this famous observation has earned its retirement. The phrase is best forgotten as an incomplete, negative gloss on an accepted pleading standard: once a claim has been stated adequately, it may be supported by showing any set of facts consistent with the allegations in the complaint. <i>Conley</i>, then, described the breadth of opportunity to prove what an adequate complaint claims, not the minimum standard of adequate pleading to govern a complaint’s survival. . . . </p>
<p id="c0b70326-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[W]e do not require heightened fact pleading of specifics, but only enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. Because the plaintiffs here have not nudged their claims across the line from conceivable to plausible, their complaint must be dismissed. . . . </p>
</div>
<p id="c0b70327-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After <i>Twombly</i>, practitioners and academics debated whether one should understand the case as applying only to antitrust claims (or perhaps to other claims where immense discovery lay ahead if the complaint survived). On that interpretation pleading principles for the rest of the landscape would remain undisturbed. Two years after <i>Twombly</i>, the Supreme Court resolved that question in the next case.</p>
<p id="c0b70328-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some substantive law background may help readers understand. Well-established law states that a person has a claim against a government official who violates his constitutional rights. Well-established law also provides protection for such officials if those constitutional rights were not clearly established, in which case they enjoy a “qualified immunity” from being sued. If qualified immunity applies, the defendant official is entitled not only to prevail in litigation but to be freed from the burdens of discovery as well. And a denial of a motion to dismiss on qualified immunity grounds is one of those rare non-dispositive decisions subject to interlocutory appeal. The next case, which has its origins in the September 11, 2001 attack on New York’s World Trade Center, looked as if it would be another case working out the meaning of qualified immunity—until it suddenly turned into a pleading case instead.</p>

The complaint contends that petitioners designated respondent a person of high interest on account of his race, religion, or national origin, in contravention of the First and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution. The complaint alleges that “the [FBI], under the direction of Defendant Mueller, arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men. . . . as part of its investigation of the events of September 11.” It further alleges that “[t]he policy of holding post-September-11th detainees in highly restrictive conditions of confinement until they were ’cleared’ by the FBI was approved by Defendants Ashcroft and Mueller in discussions in the weeks after September 11, 2001.” Lastly, the complaint posits that petitioners “each knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject” respondent to harsh conditions of confinement “as a matter of policy, solely on account of [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no legitimate penological interest.” The pleading names Ashcroft as the “principal architect” of the policy, and identifies Mueller as “instrumental in [its] adoption, promulgation, and implementation.”</p>
<p id="c0b72a48-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state sufficient allegations to show their own involvement in clearly established unconstitutional conduct. The District Court denied their motion. Accepting all of the allegations in respondent’s complaint as true, the court held that “it cannot be said that there [is] no set of facts on which [respondent] would be entitled to relief as against” petitioners [quoting the lower court opinion, which had in turn relied on <i>Conley v.

As a consequence, it held respondent’s pleading adequate to allege petitioners’ personal involvement in discriminatory decisions which, if true, violated clearly established constitutional law. . . . </p>

<p id="c0b72a4e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We turn to respondent’s complaint. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a pleading must contain a “short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” As the Court held in <i>Twombly</i>, the pleading standard Rule 8 announces does not require “detailed factual allegations,” but it demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation. A pleading that offers “labels and conclusions” or “a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.” Nor does a complaint suffice if it tenders “naked assertion[s]” devoid of “further factual enhancement.”</p>
<p id="c0b72a4f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. The plausibility standard is not akin to a “probability requirement,” but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully. Where a complaint pleads facts that are “merely consistent with” a defendant’s liability, it “stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of ‘entitlement to relief.’”</p>
<p id="c0b72a50-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two working principles underlie our decision in <i>Twombly.</i> First, the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions. Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice. Rule 8 marks a notable and generous departure from the hyper-technical, code-pleading regime of a prior era, but it does not unlock the doors of discovery for a plaintiff armed with nothing more than conclusions. Second, only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss. Determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief will, as the Court of Appeals observed, be a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense. But where the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged—but it has not “show[n]"—"that the pleader is entitled to relief.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2).</p>
<p id="c0b72a51-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In keeping with these principles a court considering a motion to dismiss can choose to begin by identifying pleadings that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth. While legal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint, they must be supported by factual allegations. When there are well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.</p>
<p id="c0b72a52-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="389" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page389">p. 389</span>Our decision in <i>Twombly</i> illustrates the two-pronged approach. There, we considered the sufficiency of a complaint alleging that incumbent telecommunications providers had entered an agreement not to compete and to forestall competitive entry, in violation of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §1. Recognizing that §1 enjoins only anticompetitive conduct “effected by a contract, combination, or conspiracy,” the plaintiffs in <i>Twombly</i> flatly pleaded that the defendants “ha[d] entered into a contract, combination or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry. . . . and ha[d] agreed not to compete with one another.” The complaint also alleged that the defendants’ “parallel course of conduct. . . . to prevent competition” and inflate prices was indicative of the unlawful agreement alleged.</p>
<p id="c0b72a53-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court held the plaintiffs’ complaint deficient under Rule 8. In doing so it first noted that the plaintiffs’ assertion of an unlawful agreement was a “’legal conclusion’” and, as such, was not entitled to the assumption of truth. Had the Court simply credited the allegation of a conspiracy, the plaintiffs would have stated a claim for relief and been entitled to proceed perforce. The Court next addressed the “nub” of the plaintiffs’ complaint—the well-pleaded, nonconclusory factual allegation of parallel behavior—to determine whether it gave rise to a “plausible suggestion of conspiracy.” Acknowledging that parallel conduct was consistent with an unlawful agreement, the Court nevertheless concluded that it did not plausibly suggest an illicit accord because it was not only compatible with, but indeed was more likely explained by, lawful, unchoreographed free-market behavior. Because the well-pleaded fact of parallel conduct, accepted as true, did not plausibly suggest an unlawful agreement, the Court held the plaintiffs’ complaint must be dismissed.</p>

<p id="c0b72a55-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under <i>Twombly</i>’s construction of Rule 8, we conclude that respondent’s complaint has not “nudged [his] claims” of invidious discrimination “across the line from conceivable to plausible.”</p>
<p id="c0b72a56-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We begin our analysis by identifying the allegations in the complaint that are not entitled to the assumption of truth. Respondent pleads that petitioners “knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject [him]” to harsh conditions of confinement “as a matter of policy, solely on account of [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no legitimate penological interest.” The complaint alleges that Ashcroft was the “principal architect” of this invidious policy, and that Mueller was “instrumental” in adopting and executing it. These bare assertions, much like the pleading of conspiracy in <i>Twombly</i>, amount to nothing more than a “formulaic recitation of the elements” of a constitutional discrimination claim, namely, that petitioners adopted a policy “’because of,’ not merely ’in spite of,’ its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.” As such, the allegations are conclusory and not entitled to be assumed true. To be clear, we do not reject these bald allegations on the ground that they are unrealistic or nonsensical. We do not so characterize them any more than the Court in <i>Twombly</i> rejected the plaintiffs’ express allegation of a “’contract, combination or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry,’” because it thought that claim too chimerical to be maintained. It is the conclusory nature of respondent’s allegations, rather than their extravagantly fanciful nature, that disentitles them to the presumption of truth.</p>
<p id="c0b75167-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="390" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page390">p. 390</span>We next consider the factual allegations in respondent’s complaint to determine if they plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief. The complaint alleges that “the [FBI], under the direction of Defendant Mueller, arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men. . . . as part of its investigation of the events of September 11.” It further claims that “[t]he policy of holding post-September-11th detainees in highly restrictive conditions of confinement until they were ’cleared’ by the FBI was approved by Defendants Ashcroft and Mueller in discussions in the weeks after September 11, 2001.” Taken as true, these allegations are consistent with petitioners’ purposefully designating detainees “of high interest” because of their race, religion, or national origin. But given more likely explanations, they do not plausibly establish this purpose.</p>
<p id="c0b75168-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The September 11 attacks were perpetrated by 19 Arab Muslim hijackers who counted themselves members in good standing of al Qaeda, an Islamic fundamentalist group. Al Qaeda was headed by another Arab Muslim—Osama bin Laden—and composed in large part of his Arab Muslim disciples. It should come as no surprise that a legitimate policy directing law enforcement to arrest and detain individuals because of their suspected link to the attacks would produce a disparate, incidental impact on Arab Muslims, even though the purpose of the policy was to target neither Arabs nor Muslims. On the facts respondent alleges the arrests Mueller oversaw were likely lawful and justified by his nondiscriminatory intent to detain aliens who were illegally present in the United States and who had potential connections to those who committed terrorist acts. As between that “obvious alternative explanation” for the arrests, <i>Twombly,</i> and the purposeful, invidious discrimination respondent asks us to infer, discrimination is not a plausible conclusion.</p>
<p id="c0b75169-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But even if the complaint’s well-pleaded facts give rise to a plausible inference that respondent’s arrest was the result of unconstitutional discrimination, that inference alone would not entitle respondent to relief. It is important to recall that respondent’s complaint challenges neither the constitutionality of his arrest nor his initial detention in the MDC. Respondent’s constitutional claims against petitioners rest solely on their ostensible “policy of holding post-September-11th detainees” in the ADMAX SHU once they were categorized as “of high interest.” To prevail on that theory, the complaint must contain facts plausibly showing that petitioners purposefully adopted a policy of classifying post-September-11 detainees as “of high interest” because of their race, religion, or national origin.</p>
<p id="c0b7516a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This the complaint fails to do. Though respondent alleges that various other defendants, who are not before us, may have labeled him a person of “of high interest” for impermissible reasons, his only factual allegation against petitioners accuses them of adopting a policy approving “restrictive conditions of confinement” for post-September-11 detainees until they were “’cleared’ by the FBI.” Accepting the truth of that allegation, the complaint does not show, or even intimate, that petitioners purposefully housed detainees in the ADMAX SHU due to their race, religion, or national origin. All it plausibly suggests is that the Nation’s top law enforcement officers, in the aftermath of a devastating terrorist attack, sought to keep suspected terrorists in the most secure conditions available until the suspects could be cleared of terrorist activity. Respondent does not argue, nor can he, that such a motive would violate petitioners’ constitutional obligations. He would need to allege more by way <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="391" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page391">p. 391</span>of factual content to “nudg[e]” his claim of purposeful discrimination “across the line from conceivable to plausible.” <i>Twombly</i>.</p>
<p id="c0b7516b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is important to note, however, that we express no opinion concerning the sufficiency of respondent’s complaint against the defendants who are not before us. Respondent’s account of his prison ordeal alleges serious official misconduct that we need not address here. Our decision is limited to the determination that respondent’s complaint does not entitle him to relief from petitioners.</p>

This argument is not supported by <i>Twombly</i> and is incompatible with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

That Rule in turn governs the pleading standard “in all civil actions and proceedings in the United States district courts.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 1. Our decision in <i>Twombly</i> expounded the pleading standard for “all civil actions,” and it applies to antitrust and discrimination suits alike.</p>

<p id="c0b75171-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent next implies that our construction of Rule 8 should be tempered where, as here, the Court of Appeals has “instructed the district court to cabin discovery in such a way as to preserve” petitioners’ defense of qualified immunity “as much as possible in anticipation of a summary judgment motion.” We have held, however, that the question presented by a motion to dismiss a complaint for insufficient pleadings does not turn on the controls placed upon the discovery process. . . . </p>
<p id="c0b75172-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our rejection of the careful-case-management approach is especially important in suits where Government-official defendants are entitled to assert the defense of qualified immunity. The basic thrust of the qualified-immunity doctrine is to free officials from the concerns of litigation, including “avoidance of disruptive discovery.” There are serious and legitimate reasons for this. If a Government official is to devote time to his or her duties, and to the formulation of sound and responsible policies, it is counterproductive to require the substantial diversion that is attendant to participating in litigation and making informed decisions as to how it should proceed. Litigation, though necessary to ensure that officials comply with the law, exacts heavy costs in terms of efficiency and expenditure of valuable time and resources that might otherwise be directed to the proper execution of the work of the Government. . . . </p>
<p id="c0b75173-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is no answer to these concerns to say that discovery for petitioners can be deferred while pretrial proceedings continue for other defendants.

<p id="c0b75174-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because respondent’s complaint is deficient under Rule 8, he is not entitled to discovery, cabined or otherwise.</p>

<p id="c0b75176-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent finally maintains that the Federal Rules expressly allow him to allege petitioners’ discriminatory intent “generally,” which he equates with a conclusory allegation (citing Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 9). It follows, respondent says, that his complaint is sufficiently well pleaded because it claims that petitioners discriminated against him “on account of [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no legitimate penological interest.” Were we required to accept this allegation as true, respondent’s complaint would survive petitioners’ motion to dismiss. But the Federal Rules do not require courts to credit a complaint’s conclusory statements without reference to its factual context.</p>
<p id="c0b75177-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is true that Rule 9(b) requires particularity when pleading “fraud or mistake,” while allowing “[m]alice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person’s mind [to] be alleged generally.” But “generally” is a relative term. In the context of Rule 9, it is to be compared to the particularity requirement applicable to fraud or mistake. Rule 9 merely excuses a party from pleading discriminatory intent under an elevated pleading standard. It does not give him license to evade the less rigid—though still operative—strictures of Rule 8. . . . </p>

Actually, the complaint goes further in alleging that Ashcroft and Muller affirmatively acted to create the discriminatory detention policy. If these factual allegations are true, Ashcroft and Mueller were, at the very least, aware of the discriminatory policy being implemented and deliberately indifferent to it.</p>
<p id="c0b7788f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ashcroft and Mueller argue that these allegations fail to satisfy the “plausibility standard” of <i>Twombly</i>. They contend that Iqbal’s claims are implausible because such high-ranking officials “tend not to be personally involved in the specific actions of lower-level officers down the bureaucratic chain of command.” But this response bespeaks a fundamental misunderstanding of the enquiry that <i>Twombly</i> demands. <i>Twombly</i> does not require a court at the motion-to-dismiss stage to consider whether the factual allegations are probably true. We made it clear, on the contrary, that a court must take the allegations as true, no matter how skeptical the court may be. The sole exception to this rule lies with allegations that are sufficiently fantastic to defy reality as we know it: claims about little green men, or the plaintiff’s recent trip to Pluto, or experiences in time travel.

<p id="c0b77890-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I do not understand the majority to disagree with this understanding of “plausibility” under <i>Twombly</i>.

<p id="c0b77891-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But these allegations do not stand alone as the only significant, nonconclusory statements in the complaint, for the complaint contains many allegations linking Ashcroft and Mueller to the discriminatory practices of their subordinates. . . . </p>
<p id="c0b77892-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Viewed in light of these subsidiary allegations, the allegations singled out by the majority as “conclusory” are no such thing. Iqbal’s claim is not that Ashcroft and Mueller “knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject” him to <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="394" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page394">p. 394</span>a discriminatory practice that is left undefined; his allegation is that “they knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject” him to a particular, discrete, discriminatory policy detailed in the complaint. Iqbal does not say merely that Ashcroft was the architect of some amorphous discrimination, or that Mueller was instrumental in an ill-defined constitutional violation; he alleges that they helped to create the discriminatory policy he has described. Taking the complaint as a whole, it gives Ashcroft and Mueller “’fair notice of what the. . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.’” . . . </p>
<p id="c0b77893-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I respectfully dissent.</p>

<p id="c0b77895-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I agree with Justice Souter and join his dissent. I write separately to point out that, like the Court, I believe it important to prevent unwarranted litigation from interfering with “the proper execution of the work of the Government.” But I cannot find in that need adequate justification for the Court’s interpretation of <i>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly</i> and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8. The law, after all, provides trial courts with other legal weapons designed to prevent unwarranted interference. As the Second Circuit explained, where a Government defendant asserts a qualified immunity defense, a trial court, responsible for managing a case and “mindful of the need to vindicate the purpose of the qualified immunity defense,” can structure discovery in ways that diminish the risk of imposing unwarranted burdens upon public officials. A district court, for example, can begin discovery with lower level government defendants before determining whether a case can be made to allow discovery related to higher level government officials. Neither the briefs nor the Court’s opinion provides convincing grounds for finding these alternative case-management tools inadequate, either in general or in the case before us. For this reason, as well as for the independently sufficient reasons set forth in Justice Souter’s opinion, I would affirm the Second Circuit.</p>

The Civil Rules Advisory Committee could have entertained a proposal that would amend either Rule 8 or Rule 12 to provide for the two-step ignore-conclusory-allegations-then-decide-about-plausibility screening process. No such proposal has come to them. Had there been such a suggestion, the proposed Rule would have been subject to extensive comment by the bar and by the academy, and perhaps to some empirical studies designed to assess the nature and dimensions of the underlying problem. That did not occur except incidentally in the <i>Iqbal</i> briefs. Commentators have argued that the Justices should have been more hesitant to reinterpret the civil rules given the available amendment process. Justice Stevens, dissenting in <i>Twombly,</i> apparently thought so as well. He wrote: “I would not rewrite the Nation’s civil procedure textbooks and call into doubt the pleading rules of most of its States without far more informed deliberation as to the costs of doing so. Congress has established a process—a rulemaking process—for revisions of that order.”</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b79fb4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What does <i>Iqbal</i> mean in practice?</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0b79fb5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Commentators have been trying to answer this question since the opinion was announced in 2009, and have disagreed both regarding the answer and the proper methodology to apply. Some have compared courts’ motion to dismiss grant rates before and after <i>Twombly</i> and <i>Iqbal</i> were decided. Yet, as several scholars have observed, such studies do not take into account the likelihood that litigants’ behaviors might change as well: <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="396" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page396">p. 396</span>Some plaintiffs may decide not to file a lawsuit knowing that it cannot withstand a plausibility pleading challenge, or might settle a case soon after filing for fear of a successful motion to dismiss. By the same token, after <i>Twombly</i> and <i>Iqbal</i>, defendants might be more likely to file a motion to dismiss, believing that the new standard increases their chances of success. Jonah Gelbach, attempting to capture both judicial and litigant effects, found that “[f]or employment discrimination and civil rights cases, switching from <i>Conley</i> to <i>Twombly/Iqbal</i> negatively affected plaintiffs in at least 15.4% [of employment] and at least 18.1% of [civil rights] cases. . . . that faced [motions to dismiss] in the <i>Iqbal</i> period. Among cases not involving civil rights, employment discrimination, or financial instruments, <i>Twombly/Iqbal</i> negatively affected at least 21.5% of plaintiffs facing [such motions] in the <i>Iqbal</i> study period.” Jonah B. Gelbach, <i>Locking the Doors to Discovery? Assessing the Effects of</i> Twombly <i>and</i> Iqbal <i>on Access to Discovery,</i> 121 Yale L.J. 2270, 2277-78 (2012). Others argue that pleading should not change dramatically post <i>Iqbal</i> because plaintiffs have strong incentives, regardless of pleading rules, to investigate the factual basis for their claims before filing and include those facts in their complaints. See William H.J. Hubbard, <i>A Fresh Look at Plausibility Pleading</i>, 83 U. Chi. L. Rev. 693 (2016). Scholars, using a variety of data and a variety of methodologies, have reached wide-ranging results. In 2013, David Engstrom counted 20 studies measuring <i>Twiqbal</i>’s impact. David Freeman Engstrom, <i>The</i> Twiqbal <i>Puzzle and Empirical Study of Civil Procedure</i>, 65 Stan. L. Rev. 1203, 1204 n.7 (2013) (compiling studies).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b79fb6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Judges also seem unsure about what <i>Iqbal</i> means in practice. Just as Justices Kennedy and Souter appeared to disagree about which allegations in Iqbal’s complaint were conclusory, judges have not distinguished between “factual” and “conclusory” allegations in a uniform manner and have assessed “plausibility” in different ways. <i>Iqbal</i> in fact encourages this inconsistency, as it instructs judges to assess allegations in light of their “judicial experience and common sense,” factors likely to differ from judge to judge.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b79fb7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the meaning of these two cases has yet to be worked out, and because they seem to offer a powerful new tool to defendants, “the <i>Twombly-Iqbal</i> motion” has become a staple of federal civil litigation. Consider a statistic: In the first 32 months after <i>Twombly</i> was decided, judges cited it almost twice as many times (22,980) as <i>Erie Railroad v. Tompkins</i>—considered a fundamental case in federal civil practice—was cited in the first 72 <i>years</i> after it was decided (13,546 citations)!</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0b79fb9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a number of cases the parties will already possess most relevant information.

<li class=""><p id="c0b79fbb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The cases where <i>Iqbal</i> and <i>Twombly</i> will cut deepest are those in which the other side, and only the other side, possesses the information that will create or avoid liability. Claims of retaliation, discrimination, and other causes of action dependent on unlawful states of mind may be particularly difficult to plead: How can a plaintiff plausibly allege what a defendant’s unspoken intentions were? In those cases, properly conducted discovery could reveal that information, but if, without it, the pleader cannot run the dual gauntlet of non-conclusory statements and plausibility, the case will die at the pleading stage.</p></li>

<p id="c0b7c6ce-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As you have seen in <i>Twombly</i> and <i>Iqbal,</i> courts, rulemakers, and legislators have long wrestled with the question of how much specificity to require in pleadings. The 1938 Rules sought to avoid this problem with their “short and plain statement” requirement. But, in Rule 9, the drafters carved out some areas where a Rule requires more detail, and statutes have sometimes either required extra specificity or forbidden it.

<p id="c0b7c6d4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . Dr. Stradford[, the plaintiff] is a dentist who maintains an office in Staten Island, New York. . . . Defendants are affiliated corporate insurers. Northern issued a policy of insurance. . . . on Dr. Stradford’s office effective August 18, 1999, thereby insuring the premises until August 19, 2000. During this term, Dr. Stradford apparently failed to pay the required insurance premiums, and Northern cancelled the Policy from October 10, 1999 to December 13, 1999. On or about December 6, 1999, however, Dr. Stradford submitted a “no claims” letter certifying that he had no losses from October 19, 1999, to that date. He also apparently resumed paying the premiums, and National reinstated the Policy on or about December 14, 1999. Dr. Stradford was notified of the reinstatement on or about January 9, 2000.</p>
<p id="c0b7c6d5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Less than ten days later, Dr. Stradford filed a claim on the Policy. Dr. Stradford notified Northern that, “[o]n January 17, 2000, [he] returned to his office from his vacation and found water dripping from frozen pipes and extensive water damage to his personal property and the interior of his office.” He further notified Northern <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="398" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page398">p. 398</span>that certain dental implants, worth more than $100,000, which had apparently been stored in his office, “had become wet and [therefore] ruined.” Dr. Stradford submitted a claim under the Policy for $151,154.74, and Northern made payments to Dr. Stradford in this amount. After receiving these payments, Dr. Stradford “submitted a revised claim under the Policy totaling $1,385,456.70, consisting of $168,000.00 for property damage, and a business interruption claim of $1,209,456.70.” Northern continued to investigate Dr. Stradford’s claimed loss. [The insurer concluded that the damage had occurred during the period when the insurance had lapsed because Dr. Stratford had not paid the premium and disclaimed coverage.]</p>
<p id="c0b7c6d6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Slightly less than one year later, plaintiffs commenced this suit seeking $1,385,456.70 on the Policy, less the $151,154.74 already paid, or $1,234,301.96. Defendants counterclaimed, asserting, inter alia, that Dr. Stradford “knowingly and willfully devised a scheme and artifice. . . . to defraud defendants and obtain money by false pretenses and representations,” and seeking the return of the $151,154.74, punitive damages, and investigation expenses. Dr. Stradford now moves, inter alia, to dismiss those counterclaims that are based in fraud for failure to state their claims with sufficient “particularity” under Rule 9(b), and to dismiss certain other counterclaims for failure to state a claim.</p>
<p id="c0b7c6d7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 9(b) provides, ["In alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person’s mind may be alleged generally."]*<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1094D_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N1094D_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*4</a></span> Here, defendants’ counterclaims succeed in alleging facts that “give rise to a strong inference of fraudulent intent” as required by the second sentence of Rule 9(b). The timing of Dr. Stradford’s claim, just ten days after the policy was reinstated, his alleged refusal to cooperate with National’s investigation. . . . and the size of his claim can fairly be said to satisfy this requirement.</p>
<p id="c0b7c6d9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We find, however, that the counterclaims do not satisfy the first sentence of Rule 9(b), which requires that the “time, place, and nature of the [alleged] misrepresentations” be disclosed to the party accused of fraud. Ross v. Bolton, 904 F.2d 819, 823 (2d Cir. 1990). Here, defendants’ counterclaims simply fail to identify the statement made by Dr. Stradford that they claim to be false. Thus, it is unclear from the face of the counterclaims whether defendants assert that Dr. Stradford’s claimed losses are improperly inflated, that Dr. Stradford’s office never even flooded, or that the offices flooded, but not during the term of the Policy. In essence, defendants claim that Dr. Stradford lied, but fail to identify the lie.</p>
<p id="c0b7c6da-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The “primary purpose” of Rule 9(b) is to afford a litigant accused of fraud “fair notice of the[] claim and the factual ground upon which it is based.” Here, defendants’ counterclaims fail to provide Dr. Stradford with fair notice of precisely which statement, or which aspect of his claim on the Policy, they allege to be false. The counterclaims are therefore insufficient under Rule 9(b), and must be dismissed.</p>

Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) ("leave [to amend] shall be freely given when justice so requires"). Indeed, defendants have already moved for leave to amend and submitted a proposed amended pleading. This pleading cures the defects we found in the counterclaims dismissed above because it makes clear that defendants allege that Dr. Stradford’s office was flooded at a time when he permitted the Policy to lapse, and that Dr. Stradford “misrepresented the date of the loss in an effort to bring the date of loss within the coverage period.” Accordingly, we hereby grant defendants leave to amend their counterclaims. . . . </p>

<p id="c0b7edf2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case did not start as a fraud claim. How and why did fraud come into the picture? The policy and the claims forms contained clauses requiring Dr. Stradford to be truthful in his dealings with the insurer. If he had been untruthful, the insurer would have a defense to the plaintiff’s breach of contract claims and could recapture any money already paid out. So why did the insurer allege fraud? Those of you who have read Chapter 5 know that punitive damages are available for fraud but not for breach of contract. Although punitive damages are awarded relatively rarely, the possibility that they might be imposed could strengthen the insurer’s hand during settlement negotiations.</p>
<p id="c0b7edf3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider an alternative explanation. Disputes like this one will be presented at least to a judge, and perhaps to a jury as well.

By turning this case into one about fraud, the insurer can present itself—not Dr. Stradford—as the aggrieved party, the victim of fraud.</p>
<p id="c0b7edf4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dr. Stradford, the plaintiff, won the first skirmish in the pleading battle, when the court ruled that the insurer defendant had failed to plead fraud with the specificity required by Rule 9. But that victory proved very short-lived, as one can see in the closing sentences of the opinion: The court grants leave to amend and grants the insurer leave to seek summary judgment on plaintiff’s original breach of contract claim—when the court granted defendant’s summary judgment motion three months later, it left only the fraud claim against Dr. Stradford to be adjudicated.</p>

The alleged misrepresentations themselves also are vague and fail to specify the obligations that Sheraton agreed to undertake. Courts have dismissed fraud claims pursuant to Rule 9(b) even where the pleader alleged specific communications because the claims lacked “particularized facts to support the inference that [a party] acted. . . . with fraudulent intent.” <i>Shields</i>, 25 F.3d at 1128-29 (party cited press releases and publicly filed corporate documents to establish fraudulent statements or nondisclosures).

The affidavit that Lanco submitted in connection with this motion provides no additional information regarding the alleged fraud.

<li class=""><p id="c0b7edfd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why does Rule 9(b) require more specificity in pleading?</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0b7edfe-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the fraud plaintiff the problem is that, if fraud occurred, plaintiff is likely still to be in the dark about some of the salient facts. In the actual case, Northern Insurance was able to get some prefiling “discovery” from Dr. Stradford under the terms of the insurance policy. In most fraud cases that won’t be true. In those “average” cases the fraud plaintiff’s lawyer wants to get to discovery to uncover information proving that defendant was misrepresenting the facts. But discovery will be unavailable if the complaint is dismissed for failure to plead with sufficient specificity to comply with Rule 9(b).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b7edff-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the defendant and the legal system the problem is that fraud and mistake cases threaten the legal framework of contract.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcroman">
<li class=""><p id="c0b7ee00-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Like contract, fraud grows from some dealing between the parties but has consequences quite different from contract. The point emerges perhaps most clearly in cases in which a “contract” plaintiff alleges that the defendant committed fraud because, even “during the negotiation and formation of the contract. . . . defendants materially misrepresented facts so as to induce plaintiff. . . . to pay for said goods when defendants had no intention of delivering the goods as promised.” Event Marketing Concepts, Inc. v. East Coast Logo, Inc., 1998 WL 414657, *2 (E.D. Pa. 1998). Contract disputes can thus easily turn into claims of fraud, exposing the defendant to punitive damages, thwarting the rule of expectation damages typical of contract claims.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b7ee01-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mistake has similar but less dramatic consequences. A valid claim of mistake regarding the terms of an agreement will void a contract. But one of the bedrock ideas of contract is to settle, in advance, the consequences of some kinds of “mistake.” If it is easy to plead mistake, a basic institution of current economic life—contract—is weakened.</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0b7ee02-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although Rule 9(b) is the only federal Rule requiring such specificity, there are other state and federal laws that have adopted special pleading requirements for certain claims.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0b7ee03-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, California Code of Civil Procedure §425.13(a) provides that no complaint may state a claim for punitive damages against a health care provider “unless the court enters an order allowing an amended pleading,” and that the court may enter such an order only after “supporting and opposing affidavits [show] that the plaintiff has established that there is a substantial <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="402" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page402">p. 402</span>probability that the plaintiff will prevail.  . . . ” Like Rule 9(b), California’s procedure seeks to prevent insubstantial claims from advancing to discovery, but through different means. Is the California approach (amend after presenting evidence) preferable to the federal approach (plead specifically)?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b7ee04-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In one specialized area involving fraud—securities—Congress has gone well beyond the requirements of Rule 9(b). The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 sets forth elaborate pleading requirements that apply only to claims alleging fraud under federal securities statutes. Two of those requirements go beyond Rule 9(b). One provides that the complaint “shall specify each statement alleged to have been misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, and, if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief, the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.” 15 U.S.C. §78u-4(b)(1)(B). The same statute replaces the relative leniency of Rule 9(b) regarding states of mind, requiring instead that a plaintiff “state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.” 15 U.S.C. §78u-4(b)(2).</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0b81515-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So far we have examined instances in which courts or statutes have required “extra” specificity. In some areas, courts, legislatures, and drafters of Rules have gone in the other direction, either forbidding specificity or making clear that it was not required. Responding to reports in which defendants fainted or had cardiac episodes after reading the amount of damages demanded in personal injury and wrongful death complaints, the California legislature has forbidden a plaintiff seeking damages in such cases from stating any specific amount in the initial complaint, instead allowing the defendant, after receiving the complaint, to demand a statement of damages.

<p id="c0b81518-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have considered how pleading helps to define substantive law and, on occasion, aspires to sort strong from weak claims. But we’re still missing an important piece of the picture. The substantive law tells the parties in general what issues matter in the lawsuit. The rules of pleading tell the parties the level of detail required.</p>
<p id="c0b81519-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But in a system driven by party initiative, one must also ask which party has the responsibility for alleging and, ultimately, proving which of those issues. To take a simple example, suppose in a claim for negligently inflicted injuries, the plaintiff alleged an accident, that the accident caused her injuries, and the extent of those injuries; would that complaint stand? You are likely to respond intuitively—no, the plaintiff has failed to allege defendant’s negligence. But why is that plaintiff’s job; why isn’t it defendant’s job, in his answer, to allege the absence of negligence? After all, we do not require plaintiff to allege that the statute of limitations has not expired; if defendant so claims, it is his job to allege that in the answer. Why? To take an actual example, why couldn’t Joseph Haddle just allege that he was fired, and leave it to the defendant to prove that the firing was justified? Putting this <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="403" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page403">p. 403</span>question into technical procedural terms, which elements of the claim must be part of the complaint, and which are defenses, which the defendant must plead in his answer?</p>
<p id="c0b8151a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In any given case, resolving this issue can be important because, as a general rule, whichever party has the “burden” of pleading an issue must also produce evidence to demonstrate that allegation—or lose the case. If the case is close or the evidence bearing on the element in question difficult to locate, the locating of the burden may determine the outcome of the case. So how does a pleader know which party has the burden of pleading which element? For the great majority of common claims (like the example of negligence given above), either a millennium of common law cases or the applicable statute provide answers. Rule 8(c) sets out a list of affirmative defenses that a party responding to a pleading must assert. But new claims and new twists on old claims arise regularly. The next case displays the Supreme Court confronting a new burden of pleading question that arose after Congress changed the rules for prisoners challenging their conditions of confinement.</p>

<p id="c0b81522-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prisoner litigation continues to “account for an outsized share of filings” in federal district courts. In 2005, nearly 10 percent of all civil cases filed in federal courts nationwide were prisoner complaints challenging prison conditions or claiming civil rights violations. Most of these cases have no merit; many are frivolous. Our legal system, however, remains committed to guaranteeing that prisoner claims of illegal conduct by their custodians are fairly handled according to law. The challenge lies in ensuring that the flood of nonmeritorious claims does not submerge and effectively preclude consideration of the allegations with merit.</p>
<p id="c0b81523-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress addressed that challenge in the [Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. §§1997e et seq. (PLRA)]. What this country needs, Congress decided, is fewer and better prisoner suits. To that end, Congress enacted a variety of reforms designed to filter out the bad claims and facilitate consideration of the good. Key among these <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="404" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page404">p. 404</span>was the requirement that inmates complaining about prison conditions exhaust prison grievance remedies before initiating a lawsuit.</p>
<p id="c0b81524-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The exhaustion provision of the PLRA states:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0b81525-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under [42 U.S.C. §1983], or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.</p>
</div>
<p id="c0b81526-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Requiring exhaustion allows prison officials an opportunity to resolve disputes concerning the exercise of their responsibilities before being haled into court. This has the potential to reduce the number of inmate suits, and also to improve the quality of suits that are filed by producing a useful administrative record. In an attempt to implement the exhaustion requirement, some lower courts have imposed procedural rules that have become the subject of varying levels of disagreement among the federal courts of appeals.</p>
<p id="c0b81527-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first question presented centers on a conflict over whether exhaustion under the PLRA is a pleading requirement the prisoner must satisfy in his complaint or an affirmative defense the defendant must plead and prove. . . . </p>
</div>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0b81528-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">II</p></div>
<p id="c0b81529-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no question that exhaustion is mandatory under the PLRA and that unexhausted claims cannot be brought in court. What is less clear is whether it falls to the prisoner to plead and demonstrate exhaustion in the complaint, or to the defendant to raise lack of exhaustion as an affirmative defense. The minority rule, adopted by the Sixth Circuit, places the burden of pleading exhaustion in a case covered by the PLRA on the prisoner; most courts view failure to exhaust as an affirmative defense.</p>
<p id="c0b8152a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think petitioners, and the majority of courts to consider the question, have the better of the argument. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires simply a “short and plain statement of the claim” in a complaint, while Rule 8(c) identifies a nonexhaustive list of affirmative defenses that must be pleaded in response. The PLRA itself is not a source of a prisoner’s claim; claims covered by the PLRA are typically brought under 42 U.S.C. §1983, which does not require exhaustion at all. Petitioners assert that courts typically regard exhaustion as an affirmative defense in other contexts, and respondents do not seriously dispute the general proposition. We have referred to exhaustion in these terms, including in the similar statutory scheme governing habeas corpus. The PLRA dealt extensively with the subject of exhaustion, but is silent on the issue whether exhaustion must be pleaded by the plaintiff or is an affirmative defense. This is strong evidence that the usual practice should be followed, and the usual practice under the Federal Rules is to regard exhaustion as an affirmative defense.</p>
<p id="c0b8152b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a series of recent cases, we have explained that courts should generally not depart from the usual practice under the Federal Rules on the basis of perceived policy concerns. Thus, in Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163 (1993), we unanimously reversed the court of appeals for imposing a heightened pleading standard in §1983 suits against municipalities. We explained that “perhaps if [the] Rules. . . . were rewritten today, claims against municipalities under §1983 might be subjected to the added specificity requirement. . . . But <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="405" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page405">p. 405</span>that is a result which must be obtained by the process of amending the Federal Rules, and not by judicial interpretation.”</p>
<p id="c0b83c3c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506 (2002), we unanimously reversed the court of appeals for requiring employment discrimination plaintiffs to specifically allege the elements of a prima facie case of discrimination. We explained that “the Federal Rules do not contain a heightened pleading standard for employment discrimination suits,” and a “requirement of greater specificity for particular claims” must be obtained by amending the Federal Rules. And just last Term, in <i>Hill v. McDonough</i>, we unanimously rejected a proposal that §1983 suits challenging a method of execution must identify an acceptable alternative: “Specific pleading requirements are mandated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and not, as a general rule, through case-by-case determinations of the federal courts.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c0b83c3d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The argument that screening would be more effective if exhaustion had to be shown in the complaint proves too much; the same could be said with respect to any affirmative defense. . . . </p>
<p id="c0b83c3e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense under the PLRA, and that inmates are not required to specially plead or demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints. We understand the reasons behind the decisions of some lower courts to impose a pleading requirement on plaintiffs in this context, but that effort cannot fairly be viewed as an interpretation of the PLRA. . . . Given that the PLRA does not itself require plaintiffs to plead exhaustion, such a result “must be obtained by the process of amending the Federal Rules, and not by judicial interpretation.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c0b83c3f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are not insensitive to the challenges faced by the lower federal courts in managing their dockets and attempting to separate, when it comes to prisoner suits, not so much wheat from chaff as needles from haystacks. We once again reiterate, however—as we did unanimously in <i>Leatherman</i>, <i>Swierkiewicz</i>, and <i>Hill</i>—that adopting different and more onerous pleading rules to deal with particular categories of cases should be done through established rulemaking procedures, and not on a case-by-case basis by the courts.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0b83c4c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the great majority of cases the pleading rules provide a blueprint for later stages of the suit. Whoever has the burden of pleading an element of the claim will likely also have the burden of producing evidence to demonstrate that allegation. So the issue lurking behind every decision about the burden of pleading is who will ultimately have to prove the thing alleged in the pleading.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b83c4d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Occasionally, the answer to that question will not matter. If Mr. Jones has neatly filed in his prison cell a copy of every grievance he made to the prison authorities, together with their responses, it will make no difference who has the burden. He will produce the documents, and the case will proceed to the merits—did the prison authorities behave with deliberate indifference (the constitutional standard in such suits) or, as they may claim, was the plaintiff just another prisoner trying to shirk?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b83c4e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But that’s not likely to be the case here. Suppose Jones has copies of some of his grievances, but not of others. In that case, the burden of pleading may take on great significance. Trial may turn into a swearing contest between the prison staff and Jones. Jones: “I complied with the prison’s administrative grievance procedures.” Warden: “No he didn’t.” If the trier of fact is unsure who’s telling the truth the outcome may turn on who has the burden of persuasion, which usually follows the burden of pleading.</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0b83c4f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So, how is a court faced with such a problem to decide it, in the absence of legislative guidance? The opinion canvasses the usual sources:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0b86360-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It looks at the words of the statute. Does the Court adequately explain why the opening phrase of the statute ("No action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions” [unless the prisoner has sought an administrative remedy]) does not set forth a pleading requirement? Perhaps because the claim does not arise under the newly enacted PLRA but under a venerable civil rights statute, 42 U.S.C. §1983?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b86361-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="407" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page407">p. 407</span>The Court also looks at Rule 8(c), which lists common affirmative defenses, and finds that “failure to exhaust administrative remedies” is not among them. But, the Court notes, the list in Rule 8(c) is “nonexhaustive” (is the Chief Justice engaging in word play here?); in other words, there are instances not listed in Rule 8(c) where clearly established law provides that something is an affirmative defense. Does the statute creating Jones’s claim so provide?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b86362-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To answer that question, the opinion examines the legislative history of the PLRA ("The PLRA dealt extensively with the subject of exhaustion, but is silent on the issue whether exhaustion must be pleaded by the plaintiff or is an affirmative defense. This is strong evidence that the usual practice should be followed.  . . . ").</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0b86363-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It then concludes that the usual practice “is to regard exhaustion as an affirmative defense” and rejects policy arguments in favor of putting the burden on the prisoner.</p></li>

<p id="c0b8636b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Assuming one knows the substantive law and the amount of detail required in a pleading, a third question emerges: What if one has several, perhaps inconsistent, stories to tell?</p>
<p id="c0b8636c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="408" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page408">p. 408</span>A common law pleader had to worry about the consistency of his complaint. If Plaintiff alleged Defendant trespassed on Blackacre, Defendant could not simultaneously deny that he had entered Blackacre and assert that he did enter but had an easement. The attractiveness of this insistence on a single consistent story is obvious: We expect people in ordinary life not to vary their version of the facts from moment to moment. A person may legitimately assert either that she made a promise or she didn’t; that she kept her promise or she didn’t; but not that she didn’t make a promise <i>and</i> that she kept it.</p>
<p id="c0b8636d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet modern pleading rules, of which Rule 8(d)(2)-(3) is one example, permit just this sort of apparent duplicity: “A party may set out two or more statements of a claim or defense alternately or hypothetically. . . . [and a] party may state as many separate claims or defenses as it has, regardless of consistency.” As a result, a defendant may deny that she ever entered into a contract with plaintiff and at the same time assert that she kept her side of the bargain; similarly, a plaintiff may seek to recover on the ground that a written contract provides “<i>X</i>” and simultaneously seek to have the court reform the contract so that the crucial clause reads “not <i>X</i>” rather than “<i>X</i>.”</p>
<p id="c0b8636e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Understanding why modern procedure condones behavior that one would condemn in everyday life requires the student to recall the role of the pleadings in the lawsuit. First, pleadings come very early in the case, often before the parties know all that they will by the time the case comes to trial or to the point of serious settlement discussions. The lawyer is therefore often setting forth what seem to her to be the possible versions of the law and the facts that appear plausible at the time the pleading is filed. If discovery reveals that one of the inconsistent stories lacks strong evidentiary support, an amended complaint will drop it. Second, allegations in pleadings are tempered by burdens of proof. Thus, a lawyer who entirely believes her client’s story that he had, but lost, a signed, written contract may allege that in her pleadings but, as a safety net, may also seek to recover on a quantum meruit count in case she decides she cannot convince a jury that the written contract existed. Finally, one has to remember that however inconsistent and contradictory the pleadings, the lawyer will often have to settle on a single version of the story before the case comes to trial. Both judge and jury will frown on a case that rests on logically inconsistent versions of the facts. (In a multiparty case the plaintiff might conceivably try different versions of the facts against different defendants, but this tactic has its limits.) Thus, inconsistent pleadings reflect not lawyers’ propensity to talk out of both sides of their mouths but a pleading system that requires lawyers to make allegations before they are certain of the facts and the law. Inconsistent pleadings represent alternative drafts of a story, one version of which the advocate hopes ultimately will persuade a judge or jury.</p>
<p id="c0b8636f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A real-life example of alternate pleading appears in ¶14 of the <i>Haddle v. Garrison</i> complaint (at page 367). It alleges both that Haddle testified before the grand jury and that he did not testify but was prepared to do so. Obviously, both of these cannot be true. Presumably, Haddle’s lawyer drafted the complaint at a stage where he was not entirely clear what happened, so he included both versions in his complaint. By the time the case reached trial, he would have decided which version to rest on.</p>

<p id="c0b86372-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have thus far examined pleading as a question of technique: how much detail; what issues are raised by a motion to dismiss; which party bears the responsibility for pleading which element of a claim; and how does modern pleading differ from its predecessors? Lawyers must understand those issues. But pleading raises another, more fundamental question: What responsibilities does the lawyer bear to her client and to the legal system? Many of those issues reach far beyond the scope of procedure, but one Rule requires us to examine these questions at the pleading stage.</p>
<p id="c0b86373-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have glimpsed one aspect of this problem in <i>Haddle</i>. Haddle’s lawyer could have avoided a 12(b)(6) dismissal by alleging that Haddle’s contract guaranteed he would not be fired except for good cause. But Haddle’s lawyer didn’t. Why?</p>
<p id="c0b86374-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Without regard to ethical responsibilities, such ungrounded allegations are a waste of time and money. The case would survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion only to collapse when it became clear that the allegations had no factual basis. But there is a second dimension—an ethical dimension. Long-standing rules and codes of professional responsibility forbid a lawyer from making groundless allegations. Consider, for example, Rule 3.1 of the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0b88a85-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A lawyer shall not bring or defend a proceeding, or assert or controvert an issue therein, unless there is a basis in law and fact for doing so that is not frivolous. . . . </p>
</div>
<p id="c0b88a86-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since 1983, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure have incorporated a version of this standard. Read Rule 11.</p>
<p id="c0b88a87-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As you saw in <i>Bridges v. Diesel Service Inc.</i> in Chapter 1, Rule 11 allows the court to punish a lawyer who files a pleading when he has no basis to believe that favorable facts or law will emerge as the case progresses. That by itself makes it an unusual Rule of Procedure. Most of the Rules tell lawyers how to operate the system: where to file papers, how to join parties, how to plead, what counts as a pre-answer defense, how to conduct discovery, and the like. Rule 11 is different. It regulates the way lawyers and clients conduct themselves, establishing standards for investigation of law and facts. In so doing, it embodies in a procedural rule a standard that might otherwise be found in a standard of professional conduct, or in the tort of malicious prosecution.</p>
<p id="c0b88a88-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One might ask two questions about such an approach. First, one can ask whether such a principle in a Rule violates the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. §2072(b), which provides that the Rules shall not “abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.” The Supreme Court considered and somewhat curtly dismissed the Rules Enabling Act challenge:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0b88a89-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court[]. . . . in Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Woods, 480 U.S. 1 (1987). . . . held, in a unanimous decision, that “Rules which <i>incidentally</i> affect litigants’ substantive rights <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="410" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page410">p. 410</span>do not violate this provision if reasonably necessary to maintain the integrity of that system of rules.” There is little doubt that Rule 11 is reasonably necessary to maintain the integrity of the system of federal practice and procedure, and that any effect on substantive rights is incidental. We held as much only last Term in <i>Cooter &amp; Gell</i>: “It is now clear that the central purpose of Rule 11 is to deter baseless filings in district court and thus, consistent with the Rule Enabling Act’s grant of authority, streamline the administration and procedure of the federal courts.”</p>

</div>
<p id="c0b88a8b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, one can ask, if professional ethics already condemn such conduct, why duplicate the provision in a procedural rule? One response is that Rule 11 allows courts to enforce the standards in the midst of litigation, rather than in an independent bar disciplinary proceeding that might occur long after the lawsuit was over. That potential can change the balance of power between the parties—and this aspect of Rule 11 has made it controversial, with some arguing that it chills meritorious litigation, others that it fails to deter enough frivolous litigation.</p>
<p id="c0b88a8c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 11 is distinctive in another respect. It establishes an interlocking set of standards, procedures, and sanctions—a miniature regulatory regime all its own, a regime that affects but does not directly regulate the entire conduct of litigation.</p>
<p id="c0b88a8d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We consider Rule 11 in the context of pleading, but it covers every aspect of litigation that involves a written document—with the important exception noted in Rule 11(d). Pleading provides a good example of circumstances in which litigants make assertions about historical facts and the content of legal standards—both of which Rule 11 covers. Read the Rule and respond to the following questions.</p>

Instead, they argue that finding out the defendants’ citizenship would be more trouble than they should be expected to take. This is a burden that plaintiffs desiring to invoke diversity jurisdiction have assumed since the days of Chief Justice Marshall. See Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 7 U.S. at 267 [1806]. The fact that the Walkers did not allege the citizenship of the defendants convinces us that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Rule 11 sanctions were appropriate.</p>

Mr. Massey replied: “I think an appropriate step for the Court to have taken would have been to dismiss those individuals that the Court considered that it could not bring into the diversity statute through pendent jurisdiction which is within the discretion of the Court.” Massey still had not alleged a citizenship for many of the defendants and did not identify which defendants should be dismissed to create diversity jurisdiction.

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0b8fef7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants moved to dismiss the retaliation claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and the individual defendants moved to dismiss all claims against them for failure to state a claim. In support of the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, defendants submitted affidavits from the two individual defendants, other Wilson Elser partners, and Wilson Elser’s chief executive officer. These affidavits denied the factual allegations in the Amended Complaint and asserted additional facts which, according to defendants, demonstrated that no adverse employment action had been taken against plaintiff. . . . Defendants contended that all of these facts established that they did not retaliate against plaintiff, and therefore, plaintiff’s allegations of retaliation did not amount to a constitutional case or controversy and the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the claims. . . . To determine whether Rule 11 has been violated, courts apply an objective standard of reasonableness. Sanctions under Rule 11 may be imposed upon lawyers, law firms, and parties who violate the rule or who are responsible for the violation. Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c). “Absent exceptional circumstances, a law firm [must] be held jointly responsible for violations committed by its partner[], associate[], or employee[].” Id. 11(c)(1). Monetary sanctions for violation of Rule 11(b)(2) may not be awarded against a represented party. Id. 11(c)([5])(A). Defendants’ argument that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiff’s retaliation claims was frivolous under an objective standard of reasonableness. Defendants’ argument was not a contention about subject matter jurisdiction. It was simply a contention that plaintiff would be unable to prove her claims on the merits. Arguments about the merits of plaintiff’s claims, of course, do not go to the court’s power to entertain them, and are not appropriately raised on a motion to dismiss the complaint. No competent lawyer, after reasonable inquiry, would have concluded that this argument was warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law. . . . Because defendants presented to the court a written motion asserting frivolous legal contentions, plaintiff’s motion for sanctions under Rule 11(b)(2) is granted. Moreover, I am persuaded that defendants’ motion and supporting papers were presented for an improper purpose; namely, <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="416" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page416">p. 416</span>to harass plaintiff and to increase needlessly the cost of litigating her claims.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10D6E_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10D6E_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">1</a></span> Accordingly, plaintiff’s motion for sanctions under Rule 11(b)(1) is also granted. Defendants’ motion was submitted and signed by James D. Harmon, Jr. of The Harmon Firm. Accordingly, sanctions are imposed against The Harmon Firm and Mr. Harmon under Rule 11(b)(1) and (2). Sanctions are also imposed against Wilson Elser, Fuerth, and Anesh under Rule 11(b)(1) for presenting papers to the court for an improper purpose. Defendants are experienced lawyers who can fairly be held responsible for papers submitted to the court on their behalf. Moreover, defendants supported their motion with affidavits signed by the individual defendants and other agents of the defendant law firm. . . . </p>

In support of its motion, Mattel proffered evidence that the Cool Blue Barbie doll contained a 1991 copyright notice on the back of its head, indicating that it predated Claudene’s head sculpture copyright by approximately six years. Mattel therefore argued that Cool Blue Barbie could not as a matter of law infringe Claudene’s head sculpture copyright. . . . </p>

<p id="c0b94d34-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hicks’ argument has merit. While Rule 11 permits the district court to sanction an attorney for conduct regarding “pleading[s], written motion[s], and other paper[s]” that have been signed and filed in a given case, Fed. R.

To impose sanctions under its inherent authority, the district court must “make an explicit finding [which it did not do here] that counsel’s conduct constituted or was tantamount to bad faith.” Primus Auto. Fin. Serv., Inc. v. Batarse, 115 F.3d 644, 648 (9th Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). We acknowledge that the district court has a broad array of sanctions options at its disposal: Rule 11, 28 U.S.C. §1927,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10E2A_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10E2A_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">11</a></span> and the court’s inherent authority. Each of these sanctions alternatives has its own particular requirements, and it is important that the grounds be separately articulated to assure that the conduct at issue falls within the scope of the sanctions remedy. See, e.g., B.K.B. v. Maui Police Dep’t, 276 F.3d 1091, 1107 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding that misconduct committed “in an unreasonable and vexatious manner” that “multiplies the proceedings” violates §1927); Fink v. Gomez, 239 F.3d 989, 991-992 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding that sanctions may be imposed under the court’s inherent authority for “bad faith” actions by counsel, “which includes a broad range of willful improper conduct"). On remand, the district court will have an opportunity to delineate the factual and legal basis for its sanctions orders. . . . </p>

Why was Mattel willing to run the risk of throwing good money (in the form of lawyers’ time) after bad? Reread the third paragraph of the opinion; does it suggest that the Rule 11 motion was itself part of a long-range litigation strategy? What message does this motion send to other would-be litigants?

Inroads, Inc., 858 F. Supp. 769, 775 (N.D. Ill. 1994). That statement may not be toothless if the lawyer practices in a state that requires lawyers to notify the state bar of the imposition of sanctions.

With the complaint, your friend received <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="422" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page422">p. 422</span>a summons, telling her to respond or face a default judgment. She asks you what she should do. What do you tell her? You would, of course, need to talk with her about the strength of the claims made against her, her interests and goals, and what money she has available for an attorney. But ultimately, she has just three choices: <i>default</i>, make a <i>pre-answer motion</i>, or <i>answer.</i> Consider them in order.</p>

Heights Medical Center</i> (page 525) a defendant who fails to respond to the complaint can have a default judgment entered against her. Rule 55. There is no reliable estimate of the number of defaults annually, but every year a substantial number of judgments are obtained in this manner. Why? For two reasons, one understandable, the other unfortunate. The understandable reason flows from substantive law. About 60 percent of civil claims are for breach of contract; a large proportion alleges the defendant’s failure to make payments required by a loan or credit agreement. The substantive law does not give defendant many defenses to that claim: If she has not paid, a judgment will likely be entered against her. Under these circumstances, hiring a lawyer to defend the claim may not be a sensible move, if the outcome is foreordained. The unfortunate reason is that, though defendant possesses a meritorious defense, either she does not realize it or knows it but cannot afford to hire a lawyer. Chapter 5 addresses funding of legal representation for needy clients and may help explain why someone with a meritorious claim may nonetheless fail to sue or defend a case against her.</p>

<p id="c0b99b74-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A defendant who does not default can simply proceed to answer the complaint; this will be defendant’s response in the great majority of cases. In her answer, the defendant can include procedural as well as substantive defenses. She can, for example, assert that the court lacks either personal or subject matter jurisdiction, that the allegations of the complaint even if true do not state a claim, and more. But whatever else the defendant does in her answer, she <i>must</i> respond to the substantive allegations of the complaint. She must, that is, either admit or deny that she and the plaintiff entered into a contract, that the plaintiff delivered or failed to deliver the widgets, that she was or was not negligent, and so on. An answer sometimes forces a defendant to admit or deny something she would prefer not to address at all, particularly in the earliest stages of the litigation. An answer can also be expensive. Recall that Rule 11 applies to answers as well as complaints; consider the level of factual investigation required to answer the complaint in <i>Twombly</i>—a defendant with thousands of employees located in many places. Note also that an answer must state certain counterclaims if they are available. And an answer almost certainly leads to additional expenses in the form of discovery—the next step following an answer. So, if a defendant does not want to default but would also prefer <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="423" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page423">p. 423</span>to avoid the expense and time of framing an answer to the complaint and the subsequent stages of litigation, what other course lies open?

Instead, it is a request that the court take some action in regard to the lawsuit. Civil practice is full of motions—to grant summary judgment, a new trial, extend time to answer, award attorneys’ fees, and so on. We focus here on a subset of motions—the pre-answer motions—that have particular importance at the pleading stage. We will focus first on the Rule 12(b) motions, which carry special power.</p>

That period starts to run when the defendant is served, and includes whatever time it takes the defendant to find a lawyer as well as the factual and legal investigation necessary to frame an answer that complies with the requirements of Rule 11.

<p id="c0b9e9ac-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Motion for a More Definite Statement.</i> </b>Rule 12(e) is best understood in historical terms. Under early common law and Code pleading systems, the complaint bore much of the weight of narrowing the parties’ contentions and exposing the issues in dispute. Under such circumstances it was frequently a fair request, as well as a good tactic, to ask the pleader to “make more definite and certain” his contentions. Such motions served as a form of discovery not otherwise permitted. Though it seems inconsistent with the idea of notice pleading, an analogous motion was carried over into the original Rules; there it proved to be the subject of more judicial rulings than any other part of the Federal Rules, often at the hands of judges unfamiliar with the philosophy underlying the Rules. At present, Rule 12(e) is infrequently, and almost never successfully, invoked. (For an example of one unsuccessful effort, see <i>Bell v. Novick Transfer</i>, supra page 19.) Some very vague claims will be subject to a 12(b)(6) motion; see <i>Twombly</i> and <i>Iqbal.</i> In other circumstances, in which the pleader has a fair idea what the claim is about but wants to know more about the precise nature of the pleader’s case, discovery beckons.</p>
<p id="c0b9e9ad-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Motion to Strike.</i> </b>Rule 12(f) plays two quite different roles:</p>
<p id="c0b9e9ae-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In its most common use the motion to strike allows a party to challenge a <i>part</i> of a pleading that fails under the substantive law, even though the rest of the pleading states a claim or defense. Suppose, for example, <i>A</i>’s spouse is killed in an auto accident with <i>B</i>, and <i>A</i> sues for wrongful death, seeking punitive damages. If the applicable tort law bars punitive damages for negligently inflicted injuries, defendant may move to strike the punitive damages allegations (though not the whole claim). See Mills v. Fox, 421 F. Supp. 519 (E.D.N.Y. 1976). In this use, Rule 12(f) acts like a Rule 12(b)(6) motion directed to a single allegation, or cluster of allegations, rather than to the whole complaint. See Fry v. Lamb Rental Tools, 275 F. Supp. 283 (W.D. La. 1967) (claimed damages for sorrow, grief, loss of love, affection, and companionship not recoverable under state law; motion to strike therefore granted).</p>
<p id="c0b9e9af-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In its other, less common, use, the motion to strike forces removal of irrelevant and prejudicial allegations in a pleading. Suppose a complaint or answer, in addition to alleging facts relevant to the claim or defense, makes gratuitously nasty remarks about a party. Under such conditions the court will entertain a motion to strike any “redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.” Courts will grant such a motion if allegations in the complaint have no relation to the case or are unnecessarily confusing; if the complaint is overly long and detailed (especially if it contains excessive evidentiary information); or if allegations are unnecessarily derogatory. See, e.g., Hughes v. Kaiser Jeep Corp., 40 F.R.D. 89, 93 (D.S.C. 1966) (striking reference to car as “death trap"); Budget Dress Corp. v. ILGWU, 25 F.R.D. <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="426" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page426">p. 426</span>506 (S.D.N.Y. 1959) (striking defenses based on alleged conspiracy between plaintiff and underworld elements described as “strong arm men” and “racketeers"). Courts regularly point out that such motions are not favored, waste time, should not be granted as to background information, and should not be granted if the court is at all in doubt. See, e.g., Fuchs Sugars &amp; Syrups, Inc. v. Amstar Corp., 402 F. Supp. 636 (S.D.N.Y. 1975). Accordingly, the decision to strike may depend on whether the allegations are likely to prejudice the moving party, which might occur if the pleadings will be read to the jury, and, if so, whether limiting instructions will be given.</p>
<p id="c0b9e9b0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.</i> </b>Rule 12(c) deserves mention here, though it comes, by definition, after an answer to the complaint. Suppose plaintiff alleges breach of contract, and defendant’s answer consists solely of the allegation that he failed to pay his debt because he was supporting a sick parent. Even such an admirable act is not a defense to breach of contract, and defendant hasn’t denied any of the allegations of the complaint. Under those conditions the plaintiff could move for judgment on the pleadings. The court would, essentially, match up the allegations of the complaint and those of the answer, and decide whether judgment for the plaintiff should be entered on the basis of the pleadings. On this hypothetical scenario, the answer would be yes: Plaintiff wins because the only “defense” stated is legally insufficient.</p>
<p id="c0ba10c1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another case suitable for judgment on the pleadings might occur if the complaint’s allegations made it clear that the statute of limitations had run on a claim. Defendant might answer, asserting the statute as a defense and move for judgment on the pleadings. See Jin v. Ministry of State Security, 254 F. Supp. 2d 61 (D.D.C. 2003) (dismissing defamation claim against Chinese television program when complaint alleged that most recent broadcast of program had occurred outside the applicable one-year statute of limitations).</p>
<p id="c0ba10c2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The motion for judgment on the pleadings will resolve a case in those relatively rare circumstances in which the parties’ pleadings reveal agreement about the relevant facts and only the applicable law is in question. In such instances, slogging through discovery serves no use.</p>

<p id="c0ba10cd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the defendant cannot move to dismiss the complaint on Rule 12(b)(6) grounds or dispose of it on any of the other grounds listed in 12(b), she must respond to its factual allegations and can at that time raise some additional matter constituting a defense. Common law pleaders referred to “traverses” (modern-day denials) and “pleas in confession and avoidance” (our modern-day affirmative defenses). Both live on, though under less colorful names.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead" id="c0ba37de-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">
<div class="epub-heading  left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0ba37df-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">a.&nbsp;<i>Denials</i></p></div>
<p id="c0ba37e0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If you consider what you already intuitively know about the legal system, you will understand why the denial is overwhelmingly the most common response to a complaint. Unlike the situations in <i>Twombly</i>, <i>Iqbal</i>, or <i>Haddle</i>, most complaints do not involve edge-of-the-law allegations or disputes about the required form of pleading. Instead, they involve claims where the defendant agrees that she would be liable if she had done what the plaintiff alleges—but says she didn’t do it. Under such circumstances, the right response is to deny one or more of the relevant allegations of the complaint. Rule 8(b) requires the defendant to deny only those allegations that she actually disputes, and Rule 8(b)(6) provides any allegation that is not denied is deemed admitted.</p>
<p id="c0ba37e1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These simple principles, however, conflict with defendants’ understandable tendency to “deny everything.” At common law, the form of plea called the “general issue” was permitted for many forms of action; this plea placed all allegations of the declaration at issue. The modern analogue is the general denial, an allegation that denies each and every allegation of the complaint. A more limited form of general denial denies each and every allegation of a specific paragraph or group of paragraphs.</p>
<p id="c0ba37e2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is nothing bad in theory about the general denial. The problem is that extremely few cases arise in which the defendant can plausibly deny every allegation or, as is more common, every allegation not relating to the names and citizenship of the parties. Nevertheless, it is still not uncommon for parties to interpose a general denial when they mean only to deny the major operative allegations of the complaint. Courts condemn casual, blanket denials because they require parties to spend needless time ferreting out the real items in dispute. A defendant who enters such a general denial may well find himself on the wrong end of a Rule 11 inquiry.</p>

<p id="c0ba8622-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, it is quite clear that defendant does not deny the averment in paragraph 5 that the fork lift came into contact with plaintiff, since it admits, in the answers to interrogatories, that an investigation of an occurrence of the accident had been made and that a report dated February 10, 1953, was sent to its insurance company stating “While Frank Zielinski was riding on bumper of chisel and holding rope to secure cargo, the chisel truck collided with another chisel truck operated by Sandy Johnson causing injuries to Frank Zielinski’s legs and hurt head of Sandy Johnson.” Compliance with the above-mentioned rule required that defendant file a more specific answer than a general denial. A specific denial of parts of this paragraph and specific admission of other parts would have warned plaintiff that he had sued the wrong defendant.</p>

What happens if defendant is not sure, or if she believes that plaintiff’s allegations may be true?

For too many years and in too many hundreds of cases this Court has been reading, and has been compelled to order the correction of, allegedly responsive pleadings that are written by lawyers who are either unaware of or who choose to depart from Rule 8(b)’s plain roadmap.

Here [defendants’] counsel has engaged in a particularly vexatious violation of that most fundamental aspect of federal pleading.

<p id="c0bb2285-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Zielinski</i> demonstrates that the traverse lives on in the form of the general or specific denial. This section asks where the borderline lies between a denial and an affirmative defense—the old plea in confession and avoidance. A defense is anything that defeats recovery: A denial of a critical allegation of a complaint is a defense. By contrast, an affirmative defense is an additional allegation—not just a denial of an allegation of the complaint—that defeats liability. For example, in a negligence case, a denial of negligence would be a defense, and an allegation that the statute of limitations had run would be an affirmative defense. Defendants, when they answer a complaint, must include any affirmative defenses they wish to assert in their answer. A nonexhaustive list of affirmative defenses can be found at Rule 8(c). Defendants then bear the burden of persuasion at trial on any affirmative defense they raise. In <i>Jones v. Bock</i>, you saw the U.S. Supreme Court sorting out whether the plaintiff/prisoner’s exhaustion of administrative remedies was part of a properly pleaded claim or was an affirmative defense. An affirmative defense, held the Court (supra page 403).</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0bb2289-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Take things one step further. Suppose that after the decision in <i>Jones v. Bock</i> a similar case arises, in which the defendant warden intends to rely on the prisoner-plaintiff’s failure to exhaust remedies. Prisoner pleads unconstitutional mistreatment. Defendant admits the allegations of the complaint and asserts no affirmative defenses, but intends to introduce at trial evidence concerning failure to exhaust as his sole defense. As a further review, explain what motion the plaintiff should make in order to prevail at this stage of the case.</p></li>

Bock</i>, the warden-defendant is offered a chance to amend the answer. Figuring that everyone understands that he will challenge Jones’s exhaustion of remedies, warden does not amend. The case comes on for a hearing, at which the defendant wants to offer evidence tending to show that Jones did not exhaust his administrative remedies. Jones could object to the evidence, arguing that the pleadings failed to raise the issue of exhaustion: By omitting the defense of failure to exhaust administrative remedies in the answer, the defendant had waived the defense, and evidence concerning a waived defense is inadmissible.</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0bb228d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case goes to trial, where both plaintiff and defendants offer evidence about the issue of exhaustion. There are some documents, but much of the evidence concerns oral statements that Jones either did or did not make to various prison staff members. With the evidence in this state, the court’s instruction to the jury on burdens of persuasion may matter. Such an instruction could say, “On the issue of exhaustion, you should find for the defendants unless you are persuaded by the preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff exhausted his administrative remedies at the prison.” Or it could say, “On the issue of exhaustion, you should find for the plaintiff unless you are convinced by a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies.” In a close case—like this one—it may matter which instruction is given. After <i>Jones v. Bock</i>, which instruction should the district judge give?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0bb228e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One point of Note 4b is that an element’s status as a part of the complaint or as an affirmative defense does not end at the pleading stage but often ripples through the entire lawsuit. That makes it important to know when some element of a case rests on the plaintiff or defendant to plead, whether it is part of plaintiff’s claim or an affirmative defense. For the great majority of common claims and defenses the matter is well settled. But this is not always so, and, unfortunately, there are neither clear rules nor well-settled principles for deciding doubtful cases.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0bb499f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 8(c)(1) dodges the matter by coyly telling us that the list of affirmative defenses “include[s]” those it listed; as the Court noted in <i>Jones v. Bock</i>, it’s understood that this list does not include all such defenses. So one has to trudge through statutes and case law in some instances.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0bb49a0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reading such cases, one occasionally finds unhelpfully broad pronouncements about how one aspect of proof or another is inherently part (or not part) of the elements of the claim—and therefore (or therefore not) put at issue by a general denial. That is of course circular: It’s part of the claim if the court so rules and it’s an affirmative defense if the court rules otherwise.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0bb49a1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="435" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page435">p. 435</span>It may prove more helpful to think of a function of pleading as preventing unfair surprise. Most cases won’t involve a statute of limitations defense, for example. If the defendant intends to raise that defense, it should do so in a way that does not surprise the plaintiff—with an affirmative defense. New York State civil procedure rules structure pleading in this manner. See N.Y. Civ. Prac. L. &amp; R. §3018(b) (requiring pleading of “all matters which if not pleaded would be likely to take the adverse party by surprise or would raise issues of fact not appearing on the face of a prior pleading"). Should the Rules adopt such a principle—or would that just lead to litigation over which defenses were “likely to surprise"?</p></li>

That effort yielded pleadings with wonderfully exotic names: replication, rejoinder (a word that lives on in a colloquial sense), surrejoinder, rebutter, and surrebutter. Today the legal system depends on discovery, the summary judgment motion, and the pretrial process to identify the issues of real contention.</p>
<p id="c0bb49a5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a consequence, in most cases, the pleadings stop with the answer.

<p id="c0bb49a6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose the answer contains a counterclaim. Rule 7(a)(3) requires an answer by the plaintiff if the defendant’s answer contains “a counterclaim designated as a counterclaim.” If the defendant’s answer contains allegations that are labeled as affirmative defenses, then no reply is required even if the same facts—for example, fraud in a contract dispute—could have supported counterclaims.</p>
<p id="c0bb49a7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, Rule 7(a)(7) allows a judge to order a reply to an answer. When might a judge do so?

The statute of limitations applicable to a breach of contract claim is four years; the one-year statute cited in the answer’s affirmative defense applies only to negligence claims.</p>

<p id="c0bbbeea-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Pleadings provide at least a preliminary definition of what a lawsuit is about. But modern civil litigation builds itself around the idea that discovery may cause claims and defenses to change as facts unknown at the time of pleading emerge. Rule 15 both allows such revisions of the parties’ original stories and limits the extent and timing of such changes in the plot lines.</p>
<p id="c0bbbeeb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A reading of the Rule suggests a tension between two goals: easy amendment, which allows the pleadings to reflect the parties’ changed view of the case as it develops; and the notion of “prejudice,” which reflects the idea that at some point the other side has to make decisions about how to investigate and present its case, decisions that become difficult if the story it has to meet continually shifts. Before dealing with the difficult issues, read the Rule and use the following problems to orient you to its structure.</p>

<p id="c0bc0d21-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1971 Kimberly Village Home Association of Davenport, Iowa, ordered an Aquaslide product from one George Boldt, who was a local distributor handling defendant’s products. The order was forwarded by Boldt to Sentry Pool and Chemical <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="439" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page439">p. 439</span>Supply Co. in Rock Island, Illinois, and Sentry forwarded the order to Purity Swimming Pool Supply in Hammond, Indiana. A slide was delivered from a Purity warehouse to Kimberly Village, and was installed by Kimberly employees. On July 15, 1972, Jerry A. Beeck was injured while using the slide at a social gathering sponsored at Kimberly Village by his employer, Harker Wholesale Meats, Inc. Soon after the accident investigations were undertaken by representatives of the separate insurers of Harker and Kimberly Village. On October 31, 1972, Aquaslide first learned of the accident through a letter sent by a representative of Kimberly’s insurer to Aquaslide, advising that “one of your Queen Model #Q-3D slides” was involved in the accident. Aquaslide forwarded this notification to its insurer. Aquaslide’s insurance adjuster made an on-site investigation of the slide in May 1973, and also interviewed persons connected with the ordering and assembly of the slide. An inter-office letter dated September 23, 1973, indicates that Aquaslide’s insurer was of the opinion the “Aquaslide in question was definitely manufactured by our insured.” The complaint was filed October 15, 1973.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11354_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N11354_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">3</a></span> Investigators for three different insurance companies, representing Harker, Kimberly and the defendant, had concluded that the slide had been manufactured by Aquaslide, and the defendant, with no information to the contrary, answered the complaint on December 12, 1973, and admitted that it “designed, manufactured, assembled and sold” the slide in question.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1135A_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N1135A_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">4</a></span> The statute of limitations on plaintiff’s personal injury claim expired on July 15, 1974. About six and one-half months later Carl Meyer, president and owner of Aquaslide, visited the site of the accident prior to the taking of his deposition by the plaintiff.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11360_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N11360_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">5</a></span> From his on-site inspection of the slide, he determined it was not a product of the defendant. Thereafter, Aquaslide moved the court for leave to amend its answer to deny manufacture of the slide.</p>

In the absence of any apparent or declared reason—such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc.—the leave sought should, as the rules require, be “freely given.” Of course, the grant or denial of an opportunity to amend is within the discretion of the district court. . . . </p>
</div>
<p id="c0bc333a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This court in <i>Hanson v. Hunt Oil Co</i>. held that “[p]rejudice <i>must be shown</i>.” (Emphasis added). The burden is on the party opposing the amendment to show such prejudice. In ruling on a motion for leave to amend, the trial court must inquire into the issue of prejudice to the opposing party, in light of the particular facts of the case.</p>
<p id="c0bc333b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Certain principles apply to appellate review of a trial court’s grant or denial of a motion to amend pleadings. First, as noted in <i>Foman v. Davis</i>, allowance or denial of leave to amend lies within the sound discretion of the trial court and is reviewable only for an abuse of discretion. The appellate court must view the case in the posture in which the trial court acted in ruling on the motion to amend.</p>
<p id="c0bc333c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is evident from the order of the district court that in the exercise of its discretion in ruling on defendant’s motion for leave to amend, it searched the record for evidence of bad faith, prejudice and undue delay which might be sufficient to overbalance the mandate of Rule 15(a), F. R. Civ. P., and <i>Foman v. Davis</i>, that leave to amend should be “freely given.” Plaintiffs had not at any time conceded that the slide in question had not been manufactured by the defendant, and at the time the motion for leave to amend was at issue, the court had to decide whether the defendant should be permitted to litigate a material factual issue on its merits.</p>
<p id="c0bc333d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In inquiring into the issue of bad faith, the court noted the fact that the defendant, in initially concluding that it had manufactured the slide, relied upon the conclusions of three different insurance companies,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN113AA_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N113AA_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">6</a></span> each of which had conducted an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the accident. This reliance upon investigations of three insurance companies, and the fact that “no contention has been made by anyone that the defendant influenced this possibly erroneous conclusion,” persuaded the court that “defendant has not acted in such bad faith as to be precluded from contesting the issue of manufacture at trial.” The court further found “[t]o the extent that ’blame’ is to be spread regarding the original identification, the record indicates that it should be shared equally.” In considering the issue of prejudice that might result to the plaintiffs from the granting of the motion for leave to amend, the trial court held that the facts presented to it did not support plaintiffs’ assertion that, because of the running of the two-year Iowa statute of limitations on personal <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="441" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page441">p. 441</span>injury claims, the allowance of the amendment would sound the “death knell” of the litigation. In order to accept plaintiffs’ argument, the court would have had to assume that the defendant would prevail at trial on the factual issue of manufacture of the slide, and further that plaintiffs would be foreclosed, should the amendment be allowed, from proceeding against other parties if they were unsuccessful in pressing their claim against Aquaslide. On the state of the record before it, the trial court was unwilling to make such assumptions,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN113B2_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N113B2_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">7</a></span> and concluded “[u]nder these circumstances, the court deems that the possible prejudice to the plaintiffs is an insufficient basis on which to deny the proposed amendment.” The court reasoned that the amendment would merely allow the defendant to contest a disputed factual issue at trial, and further that it would be prejudicial to the defendant to deny the amendment.</p>
<p id="c0bc3341-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court also held that defendant and its insurance carrier, in investigating the circumstances surrounding the accident, had not been so lacking in diligence as to dictate a denial of the right to litigate the factual issue of manufacture of the slide.</p>
<p id="c0bc3342-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On this record we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the defendant to amend its answer.</p>

The slide which plaintiff Jerry A. Beeck was using at the time of his accident was very similar in appearance to an Aquaslide product, and was without identifying marks. Kimberly Village had in fact ordered an Aquaslide for its swimming pool, and thought it had received one. After Meyer’s inspection and Aquaslide’s subsequent assertion that it was not an Aquaslide product, plaintiffs elected to stand on their contention that it was in fact an Aquaslide. This raised a substantial issue of material fact which, if resolved in defendant’s favor, would exonerate defendant from liability.</p>
<p id="c0bc5a5a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff Jerry A. Beeck had been severely injured, and he and his wife together were seeking damages arising out of those injuries in the sum of $2,225,000.00. Evidence of plaintiffs’ injuries and damages would clearly have taken up several days of trial time, and because of the severity of the injuries, may have been prejudicial to the defendant’s claim of non-manufacture. The jury, by special interrogatory, found that the slide had not been manufactured by Aquaslide. That finding has not been questioned on appeal. Judicial economy, beneficial to all the parties, was obviously served by the trial court’s grant of a separate trial. We hold the Rule 42(b) separation was not an abuse of discretion.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0bc8172-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 15 says that “[t]he court should freely give leave [to amend] when justice so requires.” The courts have read this phrase to mean: (a) that the would-be amender should have a good reason for not getting the pleading right the first time; and (b) that allowing the change now shouldn’t hurt the other side <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="443" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page443">p. 443</span>too much.

<li class=""><p id="c0bc8175-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is it true, as the court suggests, that the parties are equally to blame for the misidentification of the slide?</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0bc8176-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First assume, as the district court found, that Aquaslide and its insurers acted completely in good faith and that it was in fact difficult to tell the real from the counterfeit slide. Surely the defendant was in a better position to find this out than were the plaintiffs. Moreover, once Aquaslide had admitted manufacture in its answer, could one expect any rational plaintiff to invest additional effort in making sure that the admission was accurate?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0bc8177-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another lawsuit between these parties revealed something not discussed in this opinion: that Aquaslide and its president were aware that others had been copying their slides—there had been several other lawsuits in which it had turned out that the slides were made by competitors. Beeck v. Aquaslide ’N’ Dive Corp., 350 N.W.2d 149 (Iowa 1984). Suppose that information had been presented to the court in this lawsuit. Under those circumstances would it have been an abuse of discretion had the trial court denied permission to amend?</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0bc8178-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If one accepts the argument implicit in the preceding two notes, the case pre­sents a problem. The defendant has a questionable excuse for having mispleaded in the first place, and the plaintiffs will suffer crushing prejudice if amendment is allowed. The court nevertheless permitted amendment. Perhaps the court was simply wrong. But before you conclude that, consider whether there is another, deeper justification for the court’s decision.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0bc8179-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One answer perhaps appears if one conducts a thought experiment. Assume the amendment had been denied, and Aquaslide had remained in the case. How would defendant have responded to the claim of negligent manufacture? Would it have shown its own design, testing, manufacturing, and safety procedures or those of the actual manufacturer? Assuming the latter, what would happen if it didn’t know who manufactured the slide? If the defendant had been forced to stand by its erroneous admission, would the ensuing trial have been a travesty—and, if so, does that justify the decision to permit amendment?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0bc817a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Compare <i>Beeck</i> to <i>Zielinski v. Philadelphia Piers</i>, supra page 428.

<p id="c0bca88e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Beeck</i> opinion above did not end this litigation. The Beecks filed a second suit in state court, still against Aquaslide. This time, however, they did not claim a defective product but “reckless misrepresentation” made in the pleadings in the federal litigation. Plaintiffs’ theory was that misrepresentations in the answer (inaccurately admitting that the product was made by Aquaslide) had caused the Beecks to lose their chance to sue the real manufacturer within the statute of limitations. The Beecks presented evidence summarized in Note 2b—showing that Aquaslide should have been on notice that there were counterfeit slides on the market. Plaintiffs argued that defendant was therefore reckless in admitting manufacture without a more complete investigation.</p>
<p id="c0bca88f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case came before the Iowa Supreme Court twice, once in 1981 and again in 1984. In 1984 the court upheld a recovery of over $3 million based on a misrepresentation theory. But, analogizing the Beecks’ claim to a legal malpractice action, the court also said that, in order to prevail, the plaintiffs would have to show not only that they would have recovered a judgment against the actual manufacturer but also that the judgment would have been collectible. Beeck v. Aquaslide ’N’ Dive Corp., 350 N.W.2d 149 (Iowa 1984). The court remanded the case for yet another trial on the issue of the collectability of the award against the actual manufacturer. Would you expect the Beecks to be able to make this showing?</p>

<p id="c0bca892-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Zielinski v. Philadelphia Piers</i> derives its bite from the fact that the plaintiff, having suffered a dismissal, would be unable to refile its complaint against the right defendant within the statute of limitations. (The plaintiffs in <i>Beeck</i> may also be so barred, although the court leaves open the possibility that the statute of limitations could be tolled if the Beecks found the proper defendant.) Rule 15(c) gives plaintiffs some leeway to name new parties or new claims after the statute of limitations: It allows an amended pleading to be treated as though it was filed on the date of the original pleading. A party seeking to file this type of amended pleading must convince the court that the amendment satisfies both the “when justice so requires” language in Rule 15(a) and that it satisfies the requirements of Rule 15(c).</p>

<p id="c0bccfae-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moore relies heavily on Azarbal v. Medical Center of Delaware, Inc., 724 F. Supp. 279 (D. Del. 1989), which addressed the doctrine of relation back in the context of a medical malpractice case. In <i>Azarbal</i>, the original complaint alleged negligence in the performance of an amniocentesis on the plaintiff, resulting in injury to the fetus. After the statute of limitations had expired, the plaintiff sought to amend the complaint to add a claim that the doctor failed to obtain her informed consent prior to performing a sterilization procedure on her because the doctor did not tell her that the fetus had probably been injured by the amniocentesis. The district court [in <i>Azarbal</i>] found that “the original complaint provided adequate notice of any claims Ms. Azarbal would have arising from the amniocentesis, including a claim that Dr. Palacio should have revealed that the procedure had caused fetal injury.” The instant case is clearly distinguishable from <i>Azarbal</i>. Unlike the complaint in <i>Azarbal</i>, the <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="446" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page446">p. 446</span>allegations asserted in Moore’s original complaint contain nothing to put Dr. Baker on notice that the new claims of negligence might be asserted. Even when given a liberal construction, there is nothing in Moore’s original complaint which makes reference to any acts of alleged negligence by Dr. Baker either during or after surgery.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN114EB_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N114EB_d543d88b-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">1</a></span> The original complaint focuses on Baker’s actions before Moore decided to undergo surgery, but the amended complaint focuses on Baker’s actions during and after the surgery. The alleged acts of negligence occurred at different times and involved separate and distinct conduct. In order to recover on the negligence claim contained in her amended complaint, Moore would have to prove completely different facts than would otherwise have been required to recover on the informed consent claim in the original complaint.</p>
<p id="c0bccfb0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We must conclude that Moore’s new claim does not arise out of the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence as the claims in the original complaint. Therefore, the amended complaint does not relate back to the original complaint, and the proposed new claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Since the amended complaint could not withstand a motion to dismiss, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Moore’s motion to amend her complaint. . . . </p>

Defendant is a not-for-profit corporation licensed and doing business as a drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility in Westfield, Pennsylvania. Plaintiff is a resident of Western New York.</p>

<p id="c0bcf6c8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On July 25, 1994, this court granted plaintiff’s motion for substitution of new counsel.

<p id="c0bcf6ca-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that once time for amending a pleading as of right has expired, a party may request leave of court to amend, [and “The court should freely give leave when justice so requires"].

<p id="c0bcf6cb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The relation back doctrine is based upon the principle that one who has been given notice of litigation concerning a given transaction or occurrence has been provided with all the protection that statutes of limitation are designed to afford. Thus, if the litigant has been advised at the outset of the general facts from which the belatedly asserted claim arises, the amendment will relate back even though the statute of limitations may have run in the interim.</p>
<p id="c0bcf6cc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An amendment which changes the legal theory of the case is appropriate if the factual situation upon which the action depends remains the same and has been brought to the defendant’s attention by the original pleading. . . . </p>
<p id="c0bcf6cd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, the original complaint alleges that plaintiff was injured when he slipped and fell on a wet, muddy basketball court “while participating in a mandatory exercise program  . . . ” at defendant’s rehabilitation facility. Plaintiff alleges several instances of defendant’s negligent conduct, such as failure to maintain the premises safely, failure to warn, failure to inspect and failure to “properly supervise and/or instruct plaintiff.  . . . ” The proposed amendment seeks to allege that plaintiff “was caused to fall while playing in an outdoor basketball court. . . . in an exercise program mandated as part of his treatment in the rehabilitation program,  . . . ” and that “the rehabilitation and counseling care rendered. . . . was negligently, carelessly and unskillfully performed.”</p>
<p id="c0bcf6ce-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The allegations in the original and amended complaints derive from the same nucleus of operative facts involving injury suffered by plaintiff on November 29, 1991. It is true that a claim for professional malpractice invokes an entirely different duty and conduct on the part of the defendant than does a claim for negligent maintenance of the premises. However, the original complaint advised defendant of the same transaction or occurrence giving rise to these different theories of negligence. Indeed, the original complaint alleged that participation in the exercise program was mandatory, and that the injury was caused by defendant’s failure to “properly supervise and/or instruct plaintiff.  . . . ” These allegations not only gave defendant sufficient notice of the general facts surrounding the occurrence, but also alerted defendant to the possibility of a claim based on negligent performance of professional duties. This is all that is required for relation back under Rule 15(c).</p>
<p id="c0bcf6cf-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant contends that it will be unduly prejudiced by the amendment because it will have to return to the drawing board to prepare an entirely new defense.

Statutes of limitations are intended to limit the amount of time that a plaintiff has to bring her claim; the relation-back doctrine extends this limit. One could, theoretically, have a doctrine that permitted relation back of any subsequent amendment, no matter how unrelated to the original claim. Such a doctrine would do away altogether with the statute of limitations. Rule 15(c) does something different: It allows relation back only for claims sufficiently related to those described in the original pleading that the defendant should be on notice of the dispute.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0bd1de9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If one allows relation back for “related” claims, the question becomes how to define relatedness. One possibility would be on the basis of legal theory: Any tort claim could be joined to an initial claim for a tort, and so on. Instead, Rule 15(c) defines the line between permitted and unpermitted amendments in terms of “the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out—or attempted to be set out—in the original pleading.” That language is purposely general, and <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="449" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page449">p. 449</span>courts will inevitably perceive “conduct, transaction, [and] occurrence” in different-sized packages.

As a result, notice pleading eliminates fewer claims than its predecessors. As a further result, however, false positives—meritless cases that survive pleading and go into expensive discovery—have raised concerns. <i>Twombly</i> and <i>Iqbal</i> suggest that judges have heard those concerns, and have, by judicial interpretation, tightened the pleading regime for some subset of cases. How large that subset is, how many cases it will eliminate, and how well the plausibility pleading standard does at sorting meritless from meritorious cases will emerge only after many more judicial decisions and their assessment.</p>
<p id="c0bd4504-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The next chapter, on discovery, describes what happens in a case once it gets past the pleading stage. During discovery, parties can spend a great deal of time and money uncovering damaging information about the other side. Efforts to dismiss claims at the pleading stage are in no small part motivated by an interest in avoiding discovery. In other words, discovery explains, in significant part, what all the fuss raised at the pleading stage is really about. Broad discovery is the civil procedure system’s response to the scanty information historically conveyed by notice pleading. As you consider the next chapter, bear in mind that the current structure of discovery is in substantial part a response to decisions made long ago about our pleading system.</p>

The defense is waived unless defendant is allowed to amend his answer to include the affirmative defense.

<p id="c0bde16a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q2.</b>  Only C is correct. A is wrong because the complaint states a claim if its allegations are true; Manufacturer thinks they are not true, so a 12(b)(6) motion is not the right response. B is wrong because this is not an affirmative defense; it’s instead a way of explaining <i>why</i> an allegation is false—something that should be done by denying the allegation. D is wrong because the allegation neither fails under substantive law nor is a particularly prejudicial or scandalous assertion.</p>
<p id="c0bde16b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q3.</b>  B is correct; see Rule 12(h)(2).</p>
<p id="c0be087c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q4.</b>  Only D is correct. A is wrong because the case interprets Rule 8, not Rule 9. B is wrong because the opinion specifically rejects this interpretation, insisting that it applies to all cases. C is wrong precisely because <i>Iqbal</i> departed from a long line of cases interpreting Rule 8 in a quite different way.</p>
<p id="c0be087d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q5.</b>  Only B is correct: A motion to strike will allow the judge to rule on the validity of the two erroneously asserted affirmative defenses and to eliminate them from the case.

C is wrong because, once the affirmative defenses are eliminated, the pleadings reveal a dispute: an allegation of unpaid debts and a denial of that allegation. D is wrong because a 12(b)(6) motion is directed to a claim, not to a defense.</p>
<p id="c0be087e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q6.</b>  A (in a roundabout way) and D are correct. Take D first: On a 12(b) motion the court takes as factually true the allegations of the complaint and decides if they state a claim; in <i>Haddle</i>, the issue was what two key words in the statute meant. A is correct in a roundabout way because the only basis for federal jurisdiction in the case was <i>if</i> the complaint stated a claim arising under federal law, and the only candidate for such a federal law was the statute whose meaning was at stake: Because the Court decided the case for Haddle, that also meant it stayed in federal court. B is wrong because that would require a court to decide whether in fact Haddle had been fired in retaliation, a question not raised by Garrison’s 12(b)(6) motion. C is wrong because <i>Haddle</i>, a pre-<i>Iqbal</i> case, assumed the validity of notice pleading.</p>
<p id="c0be087f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q7.</b>  A, C, and D are correct responses. B is wrong because Rule 8(d) permits alternative claims or defenses. A is correct because Rule 15(a)(1) allows amendment of a pleading “as a matter of course” within 21 days of serving it. C is correct because the claim—now with the required allegation of causation—arises from the same occurrence “set out” in the original complaint, and thus will be treated as having been filed on the same date as the original complaint (that’s what “relates back” means). D is correct because relation back won’t solve plaintiff’s problem if in fact the statute had run before the original complaint was filed—and defendant can so contend if he pleads the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense.</p>

<p id="c0c66cf1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A hundred years ago, if a complaint survived a motion to dismiss, the case would go to trial if the plaintiff wanted it to. That is no longer true. In contemporary litigation the chief significance of a complaint’s surviving dismissal is that it enables the plaintiff to reach the “pretrial” stage—the intermediate stage between pleading and trial. Today most lawsuits end at this pretrial stage. In part they end at this stage because of the procedural device explored in this chapter—discovery. Discovery ends lawsuits for two reasons. First, discovery produces information about the merits of the lawsuit and permits parties to make informed judgments about the strength of their and their opponent’s positions. Such information can hasten a lawsuit’s end either through settlement or summary judgment, both explored in the next chapter. Second, because discovery costs time and money, it might enable one party simply to wear the other down—or both sides to wear each other down—without regard to the merits of the case. This chapter explains why discovery has both these potentials and explores how the Rules try to maximize the first reason and minimize the second reason that lawsuits can end at this stage.</p>

<p id="c0c66cf4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One hundred years ago, litigants had a limited range of discovery devices that could be used only against some persons, and only in some kinds of actions. Discovery was not always a matter of right, and, as a result, litigants were often surprised by evidence produced at trial. This recipe could produce good courtroom drama, but not, critics argued, truth or justice.</p>
<p id="c0c66cf5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="456" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page456">p. 456</span>Modern discovery has changed that picture. Both state courts and the federal system have adopted broad civil discovery rules that permit a lawyer to uncover, in advance of trial, enormous amounts of information lying solely in the possession of her adversary. Parties can use multiple tools to unearth information. Parties can be required to disclose information damning to their case. And information must be disclosed even if it will not ultimately be used at trial. Courts can limit discovery in various ways that we will explore in this chapter. Even with these limits, however, the scope and depth of modern U.S. discovery practice make it unique among today’s legal systems.</p>
<p id="c0c66cf6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To appreciate both the opportunities and the challenges presented by modern discovery, recall the preceding chapter and the dispute between Michael Haddle and Jeanette Garrison (and her company, Healthmaster). Michael Haddle claimed he had been fired from his job at Healthmaster because he cooperated with an FBI investigation of the company and Mrs. Garrison, who was eventually convicted of Medicare fraud. One of his claims is brought pursuant to a Reconstruction-era statute that creates a cause of action against anyone who “injure[s]. . . . a person. . . . on account of his having. . . . testified” in a court proceeding. The plaintiff’s theory was that he was fired for cooperating with the FBI investigation, triggering liability under the federal statute.</p>

<p id="c0c66cf9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even before Haddle’s lawyer filed his complaint, Healthmaster and Garrison (and their lawyers) should have thought hard about what documents and other information related to Haddle’s work and termination they were required to preserve. Haddle and his attorney should also have given thought to what in Haddle’s possession they must preserve. To understand why, consider the next case. Although <i>Zubulake</i> concerns a discovery dispute that arose years into litigation, many of the lawyers’ and defendants’ missteps occurred before the lawsuit even began.</p>

After she received a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC, Zubulake filed this lawsuit on February 15, 2002.</p>

<p id="c0c69418-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Spoliation is the destruction or significant alteration of evidence, or the failure to preserve property for another’s use as evidence in pending or reasonably foreseeable litigation. The determination of an appropriate sanction for spoliation, if any, is confined to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and is assessed on a case-by-case basis. The authority to sanction litigants for spoliation arises jointly under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the court’s inherent powers.</p>
<p id="c0c69419-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The spoliation of evidence germane to proof of an issue at trial can support an inference that the evidence would have been unfavorable to the party responsible for its destruction. A party seeking an adverse inference instruction (or other sanctions) based on the spoliation of evidence must establish the following three elements: (1) that the party having control over the evidence had an obligation to preserve it at the time it was destroyed; (2) that the records were destroyed with a “culpable state of mind” and (3) that the destroyed evidence was “relevant” to the party’s claim or defense such that a reasonable trier of fact could find that it would support that claim or defense.</p>

<p id="c0c6941b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once a party reasonably anticipates litigation, it must suspend its routine document retention/destruction policy and put in place a “litigation hold” to ensure the preservation of relevant documents. As a general rule, that litigation hold does not apply to inaccessible backup tapes (<i>e.g.,</i> those typically maintained solely for the purpose of disaster recovery), which may continue to be recycled on the schedule set forth in the company’s policy. On the other hand, if backup tapes are accessible (<i>i.e.,</i> actively used for information retrieval), then such tapes <i>would</i> likely be subject to the litigation hold.</p>

<p id="c0c6941d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once a “litigation hold” is in place, a party and her counsel must make certain that all sources of potentially relevant information are identified and placed “on hold,” to the extent required in <i>Zubulake IV.</i> To do this, counsel must become fully familiar with her client’s document retention policies, as well as the client’s data retention architecture. This will invariably involve speaking with information technology personnel, who can explain system-wide backup procedures and the actual (as opposed to theoretical) implementation of the firm’s recycling policy. It will also involve communicating with the “key players” in the litigation, in order to understand how they stored information. In this case, for example, some UBS employees created separate computer files pertaining to Zubulake, while others printed out relevant e-mails and retained them in hard copy only. Unless counsel interviews each employee, it is impossible to determine whether all potential sources of information have been inspected. . . . </p>
<p id="c0c6941e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To the extent that it may not be feasible for counsel to speak with every key player, given the size of a company or the scope of the lawsuit, counsel must be more creative. . . . [I]t is <i>not</i> sufficient to notify all employees of a litigation hold and expect that the party will then retain and produce all relevant information. Counsel must take affirmative steps to monitor compliance so that all sources of discoverable information are identified and searched. This is not to say that counsel will necessarily succeed in locating all such sources, or that the later discovery of new sources is evidence of a lack of effort. But counsel and client must take <i>some reasonable steps</i> to see that sources of relevant information are located.</p>
<p id="c0c6941f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . The <i>continuing</i> duty to supplement disclosures strongly suggests that parties also have a duty to make sure that discoverable information is not lost. Indeed, the notion of a “duty to preserve” connotes an ongoing obligation. Obviously, if information is lost or destroyed, it has not been preserved. . . . </p>
<p id="c0c69420-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are thus a number of steps that counsel should take to ensure compliance with the preservation obligation. While these precautions may not be enough (or may be too much) in some cases, they are designed to promote the continued preservation of potentially relevant information in the typical case.</p>
<p id="c0c69421-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>First,</i> counsel must issue a “litigation hold” at the outset of litigation or whenever litigation is reasonably anticipated. The litigation hold should be periodically re-issued so that new employees are aware of it, and so that it is fresh in the minds of all employees.</p>
<p id="c0c69422-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Second,</i> counsel should communicate directly with the “key players” in the litigation, <i>i.e.,</i> the people identified in a party’s initial disclosure and any subsequent supplementation thereto. Because these “key players” are the “employees likely to have relevant information,” it is particularly important that the preservation duty be communicated clearly to them. As with the litigation hold, the key players should be periodically reminded that the preservation duty is still in place.</p>
<p id="c0c69423-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Finally,</i> counsel should instruct all employees to produce electronic copies of their relevant active files. Counsel must also make sure that all backup media which the party is required to retain is identified and stored in a safe place. . . . </p>
<p id="c0c69424-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">UBS’s in-house counsel issued a litigation hold in August 2001 and repeated that instruction several times from September 2001 through September 2002.

Nonetheless, certain employees unquestionably deleted e-mails. Although many of the deleted e-mails were recovered from backup tapes, a number of backup tapes—and the e-mails on them—are lost forever. Other employees, notwithstanding counsel’s request that they produce their files on Zubulake, did not do so. . . . </p>
<p id="c0c69425-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Counsel failed to communicate the litigation hold order to all key players. They also failed to ascertain each of the key players’ document management habits. By the same token, UBS employees—for unknown reasons—ignored many of the instructions that counsel gave. This case represents a failure of communication, and that failure falls on counsel and client alike.</p>
<p id="c0c69426-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the end of the day, however, the duty to preserve and produce documents rests on the party. Once that duty is made clear to a party, either by court order or by instructions from counsel, that party is on notice of its obligations and acts at its own peril.

<p id="c0c6bb48-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Well within the memory of lawyers now in practice, discovery consisted of combing through paper files—sometimes entire warehouses of those files, but more often a much smaller number of documents. The digital revolution has changed that world forever. Even in run-of-the-mill litigation, digital records will usually exist and be critically important to the case. Take an everyday suit arising from an auto accident. Lawyers on both sides will want to capture the drivers’ cell-phone records—was either one texting or otherwise distracted? In addition, cars built since 2006 contain versions of the “black box” on airplanes, that capture the vehicle’s speed, braking, and perhaps more, depending on the year of manufacture. The lawyers will want to be sure that these recorders are preserved and their data analyzed. If any of the parties received medical attention, those records will likely be in digital form. If the quality of that medical care is in question (did it, for example, exacerbate injuries?), lawyers will want to make sure that those records are preserved and turned over in a form that allows the parties to see if the medical records have been edited in a way designed to cover up lapses in that care. With all this at play in a simple case, you can imagine the mountains of data facing the parties in a complex dispute—say a product liability claim (with vast digital data relating to the design, testing, and marketing of the product) or a complex commercial dispute with multiple drafts of many documents created over years of the now-broken relationship.</p>
<p id="c0c6bb49-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All lawyers today need to know a little about preservation and requests of digital information. Some large firms (and large government and nonprofit legal organizations) have formed sub-groups, usually consisting of some lawyers and some technically adept nonlawyers, which specialize in issues of digital information; firms will rely on those groups for anything beyond routine discovery matters. At the same time, an entire industry has sprung up alongside the bar, companies that offer what they call “litigation support services,” assisting lawyers in creating and responding to requests for digital information: For a fee, these companies will search large databases for key words and phrases, the most sophisticated using machine learning to suggest alternative words or phrases that might correspond to the request in question. Some law firms will sub-contract digital discovery to such companies.</p>
<p id="c0c6bb4a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="461" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page461">p. 461</span>One issue that regularly arises in both large and small digital discovery is that of “meta-data.” Roughly speaking, meta-data consists of information embedded in a digital file that describes the history of the document in question—including revisions to the document. Think, for example, of a contract that undergoes several drafts, with changes made in response to various comments by those within the drafting organization: The other side would dearly love to know why various changes were made. Sometimes such comments and changes will be protected by lawyer-client privilege or work product (to be discussed a bit later), but not always. Even if they are not protected, the requesting party won’t get the comments and ensuing revisions unless it requests records that reflect the meta-data; experienced parties devote part of their pretrial conference to hashing out issues relating to meta-data so they don’t end up with mutual recriminations before an annoyed judge. A related problem concerns data that are comprehensible only when read by certain software. Although most parties will be able to open Word documents or PowerPoints, it is not uncommon in many industries to have data files that can only be read by software that is not readily available and not inexpensive. Rule 34 tries to address this problem by permitting parties to request discovery of information that requires “translation by the responding party into reasonably usable form.” Note that, as with meta-data, a well-counselled party will ask for such translation as part of an initial request.</p>

<p id="c0c6bb4d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before beginning discovery, parties must not only preserve evidence in their possession—they must also think carefully about what evidence they will be looking for. In other words, lawyers need an overall discovery strategy. Experienced lawyers tell us that they ask themselves several questions: What information do I need to assemble to prove my claim or defense? What part of that information do I already have? What information might lie in the hands of my adversary (or other parties) and how can I most efficiently acquire that information? And, often just as important, what information now in my possession would I just as soon the other party not know about, and is there a way I can lawfully shield that information? (Often the answer to the last question will be no, but it is worth thinking about.)</p>
<p id="c0c6bb4e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To answer these questions, and thus to frame a discovery plan, the lawyer needs to envision two stories—the story she wants to tell concerning her claim or defense, and the story she expects to hear from her adversary. If the lawyer does not have such stories in mind, it is quite likely that she will blunder in two ways. First, she will ask for “everything,” a request that will likely be met with resistance and perhaps a motion for sanctions. Second, our hypothetical lawyer with this blunderbuss approach is quite likely to fail to ask the crucial two or three questions necessary for her to tell her story effectively—because she is looking in all directions at once. So—think and sketch story lines before you ask for information.</p>
<p id="c0c6bb4f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two qualifications to this advice are necessary. In some cases there will be several alternative stories, each of which is plausible, but none of which our lawyer pos<div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="462" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page462">p. 462</span>sesses enough information to tell convincingly. Remember the preceding chapter with its explanation of alternative pleading (see supra page 408)? You now are in a better position to understand why a lawyer acting in entirely good faith might, at an early stage, want to plead alternative stories—and then pursue discovery that would determine which story she wants to (or plausibly can) settle on.</p>
<p id="c0c6bb50-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second, related qualification is that discovery will sometimes turn up entirely unexpected information that may cause a lawyer to shift stories significantly, not just choosing among already pleaded alternatives but striking out in a new direction. A frequently stated ground for amending a pleading—and a ground on which judges will almost always grant leave to amend—is that discovery produced new information enabling the lawyer to tell a better—that is, more convincing—but different story.</p>
<p id="c0c6bb51-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In spite of these two qualifications, the basic point stands: Think and sketch stories before planning discovery. A lawyer who does this can conduct more efficient, more focused, and likely more effective discovery. A lawyer who fails to do this is likely to find himself wandering into many blind passages and may well overlook critical information because he doesn’t realize he needs it, as well as a motion by the other side to curtail discovery as disproportionate.</p>
<p id="c0c6bb52-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Think again about <i>Haddle v. Garrison</i>. You’ll recall that Garrison’s first preference was not to have to tell any story at all—hence the 12(b)(6) motion—a strategy the Supreme Court ultimately rejected. Now that they are back in the district court, imagine what story Haddle would want to tell and what story Garrison would want to tell. What information would each need in order to tell those stories?</p>

<p id="c0c6e265-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now that you know what you’re looking for—a story (in fact, at least two stories, yours and theirs)—consider how you might gather the material to tell those stories. Most of attorneys’ time in most civil cases is spent not in researching arcane bits of law, but in unearthing the facts of the case. Factual investigation not involving the discovery rules is entirely possible and can sometimes be more important than formal discovery. Telephone calls, informal interviews, examination of public records, online searches, and the like will often yield enormous amounts of information. It is important for the beginning lawyer not to become so mesmerized by the tool kit of formal discovery as to forget the existence of other means of gathering information.</p>
<p id="c0c6e266-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But in the great majority of cases lawyers also need to understand the workings of the discovery tools at their disposal. The easiest way to understand how these tools function is first to read Rules 16 and 26-37; then, refer again to specific Rules as this survey touches on them. As you read, consider why the discovery rules contain more detail than, say, the pleading rules.</p>

It catalogues the types of information subject to discovery and imposes discovery-related requirements on the parties throughout the litigation. (Those details can be found largely in Rule 26(b) and (c), about which we will learn more soon.) Rule 26(f) instructs the parties to confer with each other at the outset of a case about predicted subjects of discovery, anticipated disputes about the discoverability of desired information, and other issues that the judge might be able to resolve at an early stage.</p>
<p id="c0c6e268-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Within two weeks of this planning meeting—and before an initial conference with the judge—the parties must exchange the “initial disclosures” required by Rule 26(a)(1). Once the judge has the initial conference with the parties, and issues a scheduling order (required by Rule 16(b)), further discovery can follow. Typically, that discovery will consist of requests for documents, interrogatories, requests for admission, and depositions, followed by reports of expert witnesses if they are to be used, and, if the case proceeds to trial, another round of disclosures mandated by Rule 26—this time the list of witnesses and other evidence each party will present at trial. Rule 26(a)(3). Finally, Rule 16, whose scheduling conference began the sequence, also closes discovery after a final pretrial conference and order for cases destined for trial. Rule 16(e). Graphically displayed, the sequence looks like this:</p>

<p id="c0c6e270-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 26(a) describes the first stage, which it calls “required disclosures.” These can be extensive and themselves come in stages, the first of which the Rules call the “Initial Disclosure.” Rule 26(a)(1) requires the parties to exchange categories of information “that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses.” That information includes the names and locations of witnesses and descriptions and location of documents, as well as calculations of damages and copies of insurance agreements. Each party must offer such information without its having been requested by her opponent and before the initial conference with the judge. Rule 26(a)(1)(C). All this requires cooperation by the lawyers, a timetable, and mechanisms for enforcing discovery and disclosure obligations.</p>

The company lawyer has interviewed Garrison (the Chair of the Board and President of Healthmaster during the period in question) and learned that she had been “minimally satisfied” with Haddle’s work. Garrison brings some documents to the meeting, including a series of generally positive performance reviews, which Garrison characterizes as “boilerplate—everyone gets a positive review unless they’re stealing money,” and e-mails from Garrison to Human Resources sent two months before Haddle was fired, expressing concern that Haddle was overpaid and exploring the going rate for persons with Haddle’s job at comparable firms.

<p id="c0c730a3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After the Rule 26(f) meeting between the parties and the mandatory disclosures are out of the way, the parties’ lawyers can embark on the next phases of discovery. <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="467" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page467">p. 467</span>Although attorneys will use different discovery tools in different sequences, they will often begin with requests for production. In many cases the lawyers will know at the outset of the suit (perhaps from the initial disclosures) that there are documents or physical objects they want to get their hands on: e-mails, hospital bills, vehicle maintenance records, the wrecked car itself, and so on.</p>
<p id="c0c730a4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 34 enables such discovery. It has a broad scope, encompassing not only documents but any tangible item, land, or electronically stored information. An e-mail message stored on a computer’s hard drive, or on a backup tape made for crash-recovery purposes, is discoverable, as is a photograph or videotape or stored voicemail or text message or Instagram post. So is a software program with embedded accounting data or other information. As we described, supra page 460, the growth of digital data storage has substantially expanded the amount of information subject to discovery in lawsuits, spawned an entire sub-industry devoted to searching electronic records, and complicated attorneys’ document requests to include meta-data and translations of material into usable forms.</p>
<p id="c0c730a5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How exactly must the requester identify the documents in question? In practice, very broad requests are usually allowed because the party propounding the request does not always know what documents the responding party has. A typical request might seek all documents in the custody or control of the responding party that “refer, relate or pertain in any manner” to subject <i>X</i>. Such broad requests might end up calling for hundreds, thousands, or even millions of documents, only a small portion of which bear even the remotest potential relevance to the lawsuit. The responding party, faced with such a request, has several choices. It might object to the request as overbroad or not “proportional” to the needs of the case pursuant to Rule 26(b)(1), a rule to which we will soon turn. The party might, in the alternative, assign its employees the time-consuming task of searching all files and digital locations where responsive information might be found. Or the party might point to a warehouse or digital storage of two million files, leaving the requesting party with the daunting challenge of separating wheat from chaff. Read Rule 34(b)(2)(E)(i) and think about how this Rule might justify this third approach.</p>
<p id="c0c730a6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus far, we have focused on requests for production served on parties to the case. Similar requests can be made of a nonparty, but the nonparty must be served with a subpoena issued under Rule 45(a)(1)(A)(iii).</p>
<p id="c0c730a7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite the many complications of Rules 34 and 45, it is critical for lawyers to understand and become adept at using these Rules. In a contract dispute over the interpretation of an ambiguous provision of a contract, for example, each side will want to see any drafts, memos, or notes that might reflect the other side’s contemporaneous interpretation of the disputed provision, and will want later to use these documents in deposing the other side’s witnesses. These types of documents will often be critical in establishing or disproving liability. Documents can also be critical in establishing damages. Medical records, for example, are central to damage discovery in personal injury cases, and accounting records would be the core of discovery in a case seeking lost profits.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0c730aa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Haddle brings suit against Healthmaster, alleging the claims set forth in the complaint reproduced in Chapter 6 (with the core federal claim being retaliatory firing). Haddle’s lawyer makes a Rule 34 request for “all documents, memoranda, and reports relating to the dismissal of Haddle or other employees over the two years preceding Haddle’s dismissal until the dissolution of the company.” Healthmaster’s lawyer learns that on the day of Haddle’s firing, Garrison (recall she was Healthmaster’s CEO) wrote an e-mail to another employee stating “this should cut down on the number of skunks running to the feds.” Must the attorney for Healthmaster produce this e-mail? Which Rule would guide her decision?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0c730ab-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose that Haddle’s request for “all documents, memoranda, and reports relating to the dismissal of Haddle or other employees over the two years preceding Haddle’s dismissal until the dissolution of the company” does not specify the format for responses. Healthmaster’s lawyer has found hundreds of responsive e-mails and other documents. Can Healthmaster simply produce printouts of these e-mails and documents—which will be hard to search and will not contain evidence of revisions? See Rule 34(b)(2)(E).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0c730ac-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Does your response to the preceding question change if Haddle’s original request specified that each digital document be produced in a format that tracked previous drafts?

<li class=""><p id="c0c757bd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Modern criminal procedure requires that prosecutors turn over to defense counsel information that might tend to exonerate a defendant. Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). Haddle’s lawyer believes that as Garrison’s prosecution went forward Garrison received from prosecutors information about people who were cooperating with the FBI, that Garrison identified Haddle as a cooperator with this information, and that she fired Haddle based on this information. Haddle requests this information from Garrison, but also wants to request it directly from the FBI. Could Haddle request from the FBI a complete set of the information it turned over to Garrison? How? Rule 45.</p></li>

<p id="c0c757c0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While requests for production seek production of documents and things, interrogatories (Rule 33) seek out categories of information that can guide further document requests and depositions. For example, in the suit between Haddle and Healthmaster, interrogatories can be used to learn the names and addresses of all those involved in the decision to fire Haddle, every type of employment review <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="469" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page469">p. 469</span>and evaluation conducted by the company, and information about all of the people interviewed for Haddle’s job after he was fired.</p>
<p id="c0c757c1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Interrogatories have some benefits: They can get at information not contained in any document, and they are typically much cheaper than conducting a deposition because one can inexpensively frame a set of appropriate questions, send the requests to an adverse party, and sit back and wait for the answers. A drawback to interrogatories is that, because the questioner cannot follow up evasive answers with a question designed to pin things down, interrogatories that go beyond fairly routine requests for specific information may yield little of value. Another limitation of interrogatories is that parties are presumptively limited to 25 questions (including subparts) to each of their adversaries. Parties must seek permission of the court—or a stipulation from their opponents—before propounding more. A third limitation is that interrogatories may be sent only to a party; nonparty witnesses may be deposed but need not answer written interrogatories. (In contrast, parties can make unlimited requests for production of documents and things, and can make these requests to nonparties through a subpoena.)</p>
<p id="c0c757c2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Requests for Admissions (Rule 36) share three characteristics with interrogatories. They are usable only against parties, are in writing, and are relatively cheap. One significant difference between the two is that parties can make an unlimited number of requests for admission. This makes sense if one views Rule 36 as much a pleading rule as a discovery device. While interrogatories uncover categories of evidence, requests for admission seek to take issues out of controversy. Suppose Haddle pleads that Healthmaster is a corporation but does so in a paragraph of the complaint that contains other allegations as well, making defendant’s denial of the entire paragraph ambiguous. (Cf. <i>Zielinski v. Philadelphia Piers</i>, supra page 428.) Plaintiff might well seek an admission as to defendant’s corporate status. Because of Rule 37(c)(2), Rule 36 has teeth.</p>
<p id="c0c757c3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 36 functions best when used to eliminate essentially undisputed issues—for example, that the defendant is incorporated in Georgia or that Haddle received notice of his termination on a particular day. Requests for admission that go to the core of the case will likely be less successful. In this case, such a request might be: “Admit that you fired Michael Haddle as a result of his cooperation with the federal investigation.” Rule 36 instructs parties to admit, deny, or explain in detail why they can neither admit nor deny. Healthmaster can deny this request for admission, but if Haddle later proves the statement to be true, he can move for Healthmaster to pay reasonable expenses incurred in making the proof. Rule 37(c)(2). As with answers to pleadings, parties can also admit in part or deny in part. Responding in good faith to requests to admit without showing too much of one’s hand is an exercise in subtlety and discretion.</p>
<p id="c0c757c4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Complications can arise when the party served with a request for admission of critical facts has simply let the time for reply elapse without responding. Read literally, the Rule suggests that the requested facts should be deemed admitted, and courts have so held. Rule 36(a)(3). But courts have also ignored the literal language or have glossed over it when the request for admission concerns a purely legal issue or is ambiguous. Talley v. United States, 990 F.2d 695 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>

<p id="c0c77de2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In one respect, a deposition is like questioning a witness at trial without the judge—except that the location will usually be a conference room rather than a courthouse. A lawyer for each party is present, as are the witness and a court reporter or recording device. The lawyer who “noticed” (lawyer-talk for requested) the deposition will ask questions that the witness must answer orally under oath. The witness’s lawyer may object to the content or form of the questions and may ask questions of his own when the other lawyer finishes. The court reporter makes a verbatim transcript of the deposition, and the testimony is often visually recorded as well.</p>
<p id="c0c77de3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In other respects, depositions are quite unlike trials. At trial, a good lawyer will be trying to use questions and other evidence to tell a single, coherent, clear story leading to a favorable verdict or judgment for her client. Accordingly, the lawyer at trial will avoid asking any question that might be distracting or might harm her case. By contrast, at depositions lawyers have opportunities to explore what may turn out to be dead ends, and to ask questions without having the least notion of what the answer might be. A version of the same contrast applies to the treatment of hostile witnesses: At trial, a lawyer will seek to undermine their credibility and expose weaknesses in their testimony. In deposition, the goal is different. Although a lawyer will be delighted if the opposing party admits that his claims or defenses are a pack of lies, she is not expecting or aiming at that goal. Instead, she is meticulously trying to pin down an adverse witness to whatever story that witness wants to tell; once the story is pinned down under oath, the lawyer can decide what to do with it. Finally, depositions free lawyers from some constraints of evidentiary rules. At trial, if a lawyer asks a question whose answer is subject to an evidentiary objection and the other side’s lawyer objects, the trial judge will direct the witness not to answer the question. In a deposition, the witness must answer the question (unless the answer would reveal privileged information or information protected by court order). The objection is noted on the record, and the court may prevent this portion of the deposition from being used at later stages of litigation, but the answer is recorded. As a result, some depositions yield a good deal of information that will not be admissible.</p>
<p id="c0c77de4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The major advantage of a deposition over interrogatories is that the lawyer can ask a series of questions that forces the witness to take a position as to the <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="472" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page472">p. 472</span>matters at issue, and the lawyer can immediately follow up with further questions if the witness is evasive or if the testimony opens up new avenues of inquiry. The disadvantage is expense to all concerned. In a deposition, both sides have their lawyers present; if the witness is not one of the parties, he or she may also be represented by a lawyer. In addition, the lawyer who noticed the deposition must arrange for a court reporter to transcribe the deposition and, sometimes, a videographer. In a case with multiple parties, each hour of deposition time may amount to thousands of dollars in attorneys’ fees and stenographer’s and videographer’s time.</p>
<p id="c0c77de5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As with interrogatories, the Rules place limits on depositions. Without seeking permission, the total number of depositions taken by one side (plaintiff(s), defendant(s), third-party defendant(s)) may not exceed ten; no deposition may exceed a day of seven hours; and no person may be deposed a second time without the permission of the court or the other side. See Rule 30(a)(2)(A)(i).</p>
<p id="c0c77de6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Conducting depositions of witnesses embedded in large organizations (corporations, governments, universities, etc.) presents special problems. Sometimes the lawyer will want to depose a person with knowledge about a particular area—product design, marketing, curriculum, etc.—without knowing who in the organization has that information. Rule 30(b)(6) allows the requester to identify a topic to be explored, placing the burden on the organization to produce a knowledgeable person.</p>
<p id="c0c77de7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Parties can undergo an additional, particularly sensitive type of questioning and investigation, this time by doctors instead of lawyers. Rule 35 allows physical and mental examinations of parties and usually is employed only when the physical or mental condition of the party is at stake in the case. Take, for example, <i>Reise</i>, in Chapter 1, in which the court orders a psychological evaluation of a plaintiff who alleged emotional injuries resulting from defendants’ actions. Similarly, a plaintiff who alleges physical injury might be evaluated by a doctor chosen by the defendant. Unlike other discovery provisions, Rule 35 requires a special application to the court and a showing of “good cause” for such an evaluation. The disputes here focus on what constitutes “good cause,” with courts asked to balance need against issues of privacy.</p>
<p id="c0c7a4f8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is well settled that a plaintiff who puts his mental or physical condition at issue by seeking damages for mental or physical injury can be required to undergo a mental or physical examination. The same is true where a defendant has specifically asserted a defense that puts his mental or physical condition at issue. If the defendant in a contract case files an answer that pleads as an affirmative defense that the defendant was mentally incompetent and therefore could not enter into a binding contract, the defendant could be required to undergo an examination regarding his mental capacity.</p>
<p id="c0c7a4f9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the law is much less permissive about allowing physical or mental exams where a party has not clearly put her own physical or mental condition at issue. In the leading case, Schlagenhauf v. Holder, 379 U.S. 104 (1964), a Greyhound bus rear-ended a tractor-trailer. Passengers on the bus were injured and brought suit <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="473" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page473">p. 473</span>against Greyhound, the driver, the owner of the tractor, and the owner of the trailer. The tractor and trailer owners sought—and the district judge ordered—vision, neurological, psychiatric, and internal medicine exams of the defendant bus driver. In support of the exams, the tractor owner’s counsel submitted an affidavit which stated that the driver had testified at his deposition that he had seen the rear lights of the vehicle ahead of him for 10-15 seconds, but had not slowed down, and had rear-ended the vehicle. The affidavit also established that the bus driver had been involved in a prior similar accident.</p>
<p id="c0c7a4fa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A divided Supreme Court held that the record supported at most a vision exam of the driver. The majority concluded that “[n]othing in the pleadings or affidavit would afford a basis for a belief that Schlagenhauf was suffering from a mental or neurological illness warranting wide-ranging psychiatric or neurological examinations. Nor is there anything stated justifying the broad internal medicine examination.” The dissenters would have allowed all of the exams ordered by the district court. The dissenting opinion reasoned: “In a collision case like this one, evidence concerning very bad eyesight or impaired mental or physical health which may affect the ability to drive is obviously of the highest relevance. It is equally obvious, I think, that when a vehicle continues down an open road and smashes into a truck in front of it although the truck is in plain sight and there is ample time and room to avoid collision, the chances are good that the driver has some physical, mental or moral defect. When such a thing happens twice, one is even more likely to ask, ’What is the matter with that driver? Is he blind or crazy?’”</p>

When Haddle’s lawyer asks that the deposition be continued, Healthmaster’s lawyer refuses, citing Rule 30(d)(1), which presumptively limits depositions to seven hours.

Imagine, for example, that Haddle’s lawyer conducts her Rule 30(b)(6) deposition of Geraldine Chen, the vice president for Human Resources. Haddle’s lawyer learns during Chen’s deposition that, a few years before Haddle’s dismissal, Healthmaster fired another employee when the firm was under another investigation. Haddle’s attorney will most likely submit a document request seeking records concerning that previous firing. Upon reviewing those records, Haddle’s attorney might learn that Healthmaster has a previously undisclosed “special employee review” process for employees who cooperated in this prior investigation, and demand production of records reflecting that process. Haddle’s attorney might also submit an interrogatory seeking a list of all previous employees dismissed after that special process was invoked. In other words, parties will usually make comprehensive document requests before taking depositions but depositions can prompt additional document requests and interrogatories; those documents and interrogatory responses can prompt additional depositions and requests. The next chart attempts to illustrate the fluidity with which these discovery tools may be used.</p></li>

<p id="c0c8416d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The discovery process ends in the way it begins—with a final round of disclosures. These disclosures include a list of the witnesses and other evidence—expert reports, exhibits, documents—that each side proposes to introduce at trial. Rule 26(a)(3). (See <i>Monfore v. Phillips,</i> infra page 619, for an illustration of the constraints a final pretrial order can place on trial.) In many cases, these final pretrial disclosures will be set in concrete by the judge’s final pretrial conference and the ensuing order. Rule 16(e). Contrary to the impression one might gain from depictions of trials in film and other media, the final pretrial order practically forecloses the possibility of surprise witnesses and evidence.</p>

<div class="epub-feature-heading2 cc-font-medium epub-text-left"><p id="c0c8416f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-left"><i>David and Goliath Do Discovery: A Taxonomy of Problems</i></p></div>
<p id="c0c84170-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the parties bear the costs of fact investigation in the U.S. legal system, imbalances in each side’s financial resources could affect the outcome of cases regardless of the merits. Note that the problem isn’t merely or even primarily “which litigant has the most money.” A poor litigant with a strong claim for substantial damages will have plenty of litigation resources if she finds a well-financed lawyer to take her case on a contingent fee basis. As is described in Chapter 5, parties with strong claims can also borrow to finance litigation, including discovery. As a result, a wealthy defendant whose defense is being financed by a liability insurer seeking to reduce litigation expenses may have fewer resources than a poorer plaintiff with strong financial backing. And a defendant who perceives that more is at stake than the individual case suggests—reputation, subsequent similar claims—may be willing to spend more than the case warrants. Although the motivations and resources available to parties vary from case to case, there are undoubtedly many situations in which David is battling Goliath.</p>
<p id="c0c84171-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What impact does mismatched resources have on discovery? The problem has two versions. First, what happens if one party lacks resources to do adequate discovery? The most troubling case arises when most of the likely evidence is in defendant’s hands, and the assembly of evidence would likely be complex—perhaps in a product liability or environmental hazard claim. Without access to discovery, such a claim has no chance of succeeding. Although the Rules nowhere address this problem specifically, several possibilities present themselves. The party with fewer resources may be able to collect evidence from various public sources—government or public documents, press sources, and the like. Digital media and the Internet have made such searches much faster and cheaper than they were 50 years ago. Moreover, a disciplined discovery scheme making maximum use of cheap discovery (such as document requests and interrogatories) may yield a good deal. With large public and private institutions, well-planned document requests can produce rich veins of information. With the information developed from such <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="478" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page478">p. 478</span>cheap discovery, a party might be able to approach one of the growing number of firms that advance litigation costs on the basis of their assessment of the merits of an individual case (see supra pages 344-45). It is also worth remembering that in most large institutions there is (a) often another copy of the missing document and (b) someone in whose interest it is to disclose that document or say who destroyed it—if only to avoid blame falling on him.</p>
<p id="c0c84172-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It may also be possible to freeride on the discovery efforts of others: A deposition conducted by one party will likely yield useful information for a coparty or a future litigation. One Rule makes this avenue more difficult to pursue. Rule 5(d)(1) forbids parties from filing with the court many discovery responses “until they are used in the proceeding or the court orders filing.” The motivation behind this amendment was simple: Courts were running out of space to store such documents. But the consequences may be to curtail the availability of discovery materials in separate but factually related cases, making it harder for an ill-funded party to “piggyback” on another’s efforts unless the attorneys in the cases coordinate. On the other hand, a party seeking these litigation materials can simply subpoena them from the parties in the other case (assuming they are not covered by a protective order of the kind at issue in <i>Kalinauskas v. Wong,</i> at page 546).</p>
<p id="c0c84173-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second problem comes if we assume grossly mismatched resources: A modestly financed plaintiff faces an institutional defendant who anticipates many similar cases to come is motivated to spend what appears to be an irrational amount on the particular case. Again, this may be more a problem of litigation finance than of the discovery rules, but a few comments may put the issue in context. If plaintiff’s lawyer perceives this to be the case, one possibility is to partner with other lawyers who may be interested in financing this case because they relish the possibility of the future cases the defendant is seeking to avert. Another possibility would be to try to use defendant’s fears as leverage for a settlement: An unlitigated case will not yield discovery that can be used in future cases. Parties can also use the Rules to address some of these resource issues. Rule 26(b)(1), amended in 2015, now provides that the scope of discovery be “proportional to the needs of the case,” determined, in part, by the parties’ resources. And a party might seek to use the provision of Rule 26(g) that requires each lawyer to certify that discovery requests or objections are “neither unreasonable nor unduly burdensome or expensive, considering the needs of the case, prior discovery in the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in the action.”</p>

<p id="c0c86886-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having now surveyed the types of discovery tools that each side can use to uncover information, we now turn to the breadth of information that can be uncovered with these tools. Both the power and the destructive potential of the discovery tools hinge on the scope of their reach.</p>
<p id="c0c86887-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 26(b)(1) allows the parties, without court approval, to seek discovery “regarding any nonprivileged matter that is <i>relevant</i> to any party’s claim or defense.” Discoverability does not, however, turn on relevance alone. Even relevant information <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="479" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page479">p. 479</span>can be protected from discovery if it is <i>privileged</i> (Rule 26(b)(1)); if it is unduly cumulative, duplicative, burdensome, or not proportional to the needs of the case (Rules 26(b)(1) and 26(b)(2)(C)); or if its potential for annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense outweigh its evidentiary value (Rule 26(b)(2)(C)). We will consider the scope of each of these terms.</p>
<div id="c0c86888-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0c86889-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">1.&nbsp;Relevance</p></h3></div>

<p id="c0c8688a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To be admissible at trial, evidence must be relevant. “Relevance” links admissibility to the substantive law and to common-sense patterns of inference. Start with common sense: How I tie my shoelaces is irrelevant to whether it will rain today; how the sky looks is highly relevant to that question. But legal relevance demands more than this. For a piece of information to be relevant to a legal proposition, that information must tend to prove or disprove something the governing substantive law says matters. If it doesn’t matter, the law of evidence will prevent that information from being presented at trial. For example, if, in a contract dispute, the defendant contends that he failed to pay for goods because the goods were defective, the condition of the goods will be relevant and can be offered in evidence. If the defendant instead contends that he failed to pay for the goods because he used the money to support a sick relative, the state of the relative’s health would be legally irrelevant. Its irrelevance flows from the law of contract, which says that one’s motives for breaching a contract don’t matter.</p>
<p id="c0c8688b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the discovery rules aim to unearth information that would be admissible at trial, they too are linked to relevance. But for discovery the links can be more attenuated. The Advisory Committee notes to Rule 26(b) explain that “[i]nformation within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable.” For a simple example of information that would be relevant and discoverable—because likely to lead to admissible evidence—but not directly admissible, consider a deposition in an auto accident case. Plaintiff seeks evidence that the light was red when defendant entered the intersection. Witness has already said he did not observe the color of the light. Lawyer asks, “Did you hear anyone say that he or she saw that the light was red?” At trial, a judge would, if defendant objected, tell the lawyer not to ask that question because it calls for hearsay. But in discovery the question is proper because Witness’s response may well lead to identification of another witness who can say from personal observation whether the light was red.</p>
<p id="c0c8688c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both substantive law and pleading narrow the range of potentially relevant and thus discoverable information. In a claim for breach of contract to deliver goods, suppose the defendant pleaded, as his sole defense, the running of the statute of limitations. On the basis of that pleading, information about whether the plaintiff had fulfilled her part of the agreement would not be “relevant to” the defendant’s “defense.” By contrast, if in addition to pleading the running of the statute of limitations, defendant admitted that he failed to deliver the goods but asserted that he did so because plaintiff had not paid him for those goods, questions about plaintiff’s performance would become relevant and subject to discovery.</p>

<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0c88fa4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">Background</p></div>
<p id="c0c88fa5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff Maryann Favale worked as an administrative assistant at Saint Joseph’s School in Brookfield, Connecticut, for approximately twenty-one years. During this time period, in November of 2002, Sister Bernice Stobierski became the new interim principal. Then, in May 2003, Sister Stobierski assumed the position of full-time principal. Maryann Favale alleges that Sister Stobierski subjected her to “severe and repeated sexual harassment” in the workplace from December 2002 to June 2003. Specifically, plaintiff alleges that Sister Stobierski touched her inappropriately, made sexually suggestive comments, exhibited lewd behavior, and requested physical affection. Plaintiff first informed her employer, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bridgeport, (“the Diocese”) of the alleged sexual harassment on June 11, 2003. Maryann Favale, who no longer works at Saint Joseph’s School, seeks damages against the Diocese for sexual harassment, retaliation, defamation, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, negligent hiring, negligent supervision, and other causes of action. In addition, co-plaintiff Mark Favale asserts a claim for loss of consortium against the defendant. Sister Stobierski is not a party to this case.</p>
<p id="c0c88fa6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs now seek to compel Sister Stobierski to testify to any prior treatment she may have received for her alleged anger management history and psychological or psychiatric conditions. Plaintiffs also move to compel the Diocese to produce any records it has of any such treatment. [The Diocese objects to both motions to compel on relevance grounds, among others.]  . . . </p>

<p id="c0c88fa8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs assert that Sister Stobierski’s testimony regarding the treatment she received for her alleged anger management, psychological, and psychiatric conditions is relevant to their claims of negligent hiring and negligent supervision. To assert a negligent hiring claim under Connecticut law, a plaintiff must “[p]lead and prove that she was injured by the defendant’s own negligence in failing to select as its employee a person who was fit and competent to perform the job in question and that her injuries resulted from the employee’s unfit or incompetent performance of his work.” Roberts v. Circuit-Wise, Inc., 142 F. Supp. 2d 211, 214 n.1 (D. Conn. 2001). Similarly, Connecticut law requires that a plaintiff bringing a negligent supervision claim</p>

A defendant does not owe a duty of care to protect a plaintiff from another employee’s tortious acts unless the defendant knew or reasonably should have known of the employee’s propensity to engage in that type of tortious conduct.</p>
</div>
<p id="c0c88faa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Abate v. Circuit-Wise, Inc., 130 F. Supp. 2d 341, 344 (D. Conn. 2001). Both negligent hiring and negligent supervision claims turn upon the type of wrongful conduct that actually precipitated the harm suffered by plaintiff. “It is well settled that defendants cannot be held liable for their alleged negligent hiring, training, supervision or retention of an employee accused of wrongful conduct unless they had notice of said employee’s propensity for the type of behavior causing the plaintiff’s harm.” Elbert v. Connecticut Yankee Council, Inc., No. CV010456879S, 2004 WL 1832935, at *13 (Conn. Super. Ct. July 16, 2004) (citations, internal quotation marks, and punctuation omitted).</p>
<p id="c0c88fab-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs allege that the defendant negligently hired and supervised an individual who was not fit to be the principal of an elementary school. They contend that the “defendant knew or reasonably should have known that Sister Stobierski was unfit to be the principal of St. Joseph’s School as a result of her prior emotional and anger management issues, and limited school administration experience.”. . . . Yet, plaintiffs do not allege that Sister Stobierski’s prior emotional and anger management issues harmed plaintiff.</p>
<p id="c0c88fac-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rather, the only type of harm alleged to have been suffered by Maryann Favale was harm resulting from repeated acts of sexual harassment, and plaintiffs do not maintain that Sister Stobierski’s alleged anger management and psychological or psychiatric conditions contributed to the sexual harassment. Accordingly, Sister Stobierski’s testimony pertaining to the treatment she allegedly received for her anger management, psychological, or psychiatric conditions is not relevant because it does not pertain to the defense or claim of any party.</p>
<p id="c0c88fad-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Indeed, even if the Diocese was aware of Sister Stobierski’s alleged anger management history or psychological or psychiatric conditions, this knowledge would have no bearing on plaintiffs’ claims for negligent supervision and negligent hiring because the wrongful conduct of which the Diocese would have had notice was not the same type of wrongful conduct that caused Maryann Favale harm. Notice of Sister Stobierski’s alleged anger management history or psychological or psychiatric conditions does not equate to notice of Sister Stobierski’s propensity to commit acts of sexual harassment. The Diocese’s objection to plaintiffs’ motion to compel the testimony of Sister Stobierski is sustained, and plaintiffs’ motion is denied.</p>

Again, it is significant that plaintiffs do not allege that Maryann Favale was harmed by Sister Stobierski’s alleged inability to control her anger or her alleged psychological or psychiatric conditions. Sexual harassment is the only type of harm alleged by plaintiffs. . . . </p>

<li class=""><p id="c0c8b6c8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To solidify your understanding of the link between relevance and substantive law, imagine that the complaint in this case alleged that Sister Stobierski yelled at and hit Favale.

If Favale disagrees with the district court’s ruling, can she seek review in the court of appeals? The answer is yes, but not until there is a final judgment in the case. (See <i>Reise</i> in Chapter 1.) Realistically, Favale will not appeal the decision unless she loses her case against the Diocese on summary judgment or at trial. If she wins the case, this discovery dispute will no longer matter to her. If the case settles, a condition of settlement would most certainly be to foreclose further litigation of this matter.</p></li>

Consider the following problems:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0c8b6cb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Albert and Barbara are involved in an automobile collision. Albert sues Barbara, alleging negligence. Barbara denies liability. Albert seeks to discover the size of Barbara’s bank account. (He wants to know whether she will be capable of satisfying a damage judgment.) Is this information discoverable? Probably not; the information, while relevant to Albert’s ability to recover a damage judgment, is not relevant to whether Barbara was negligent.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0c8b6cc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Same facts as in 4a, except that in addition to asserting negligence, Albert alleges that Barbara intentionally collided with him. Intentional torts carry with them the possibility of punitive damages, and in many jurisdictions a jury asked to award punitive damages may consider the wealth of the defendant, the idea being that the punishment should be tailored to the defendant’s circumstances. Albert again seeks to discover the size of Barbara’s bank account. It is now “relevant to a claim or defense” and thus discoverable because the amount of Barbara’s assets will determine an appropriate sanction. What has changed here is not the rules of discovery but the substantive law.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0c8dddd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Same lawsuit as in 4a—that is, a negligence action, with no allegations of intentional harm. Albert, fearing that Barbara may lack assets to pay damages, seeks to discover whether Barbara has a liability insurance policy that would be available to satisfy a damage judgment if he wins the suit. If one considers only relevance to a claim or defense, the insurance policy would seem irrelevant for the reasons described in the discussion of Problem 4a. Yet Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(iv) requires Barbara to disclose this information. This disclosure requirement, outside the bounds of relevance, appears to reflect a policy choice to discourage litigation pursued in the hope of non-existent assets.</p></li>

<p id="c0c904ff-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given the overbroad nature of Plaintiff’s requests, the Court finds that the requests are unduly burdensome and seek information that is disproportionate to the needs of this case. However, with an appropriate time limitation, a request for accident reports and consumer complaints concerning incidents where the MagicBullet/Nutribullet Pro 900 Series could not be turned off is relevant and proportional to the needs of the case. The Motion to Compel is therefore granted in part, and Defendant shall supplement its response by producing all accident reports and consumer complaints occurring within five years prior to Plaintiff’s incident through the date of Plaintiff’s Complaint concerning incidents where the MagicBullet/Nutribullet Pro 900 Series could not be turned off. <i>See</i> Moore v. Armour Pharmaceutical Co., 927 F.2d 1194, 1197 (11th Cir. 1991) (stating that the trial court “has wide discretion in setting the limits of discovery”); <i>Farnsworth</i>, 758 F.2d at 1547 (same); <i>Commercial Union Ins. Co.</i>, 730 F.2d at 731 (“Case law states that a motion to compel discovery is committed to the discretion of the trial court”).</p>
<p id="c0c90500-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Last, Defendant objected to Plaintiff’s Requests Number 4 and 5 as seeking confidential and private information, including private information concerning other consumers. The confidential and private information of other consumers is irrelevant to Plaintiffs’ claims. Therefore, Defendant shall redact all accident reports and consumer complaints produced to Plaintiffs for the consumers’ private and confidential information, including any names, addresses, telephone numbers, and social security numbers. . . . </p>

<p id="c0c90507-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff, Jim David Wagoner (“Wagoner”) seeks to compel defendant Lewis Gale Medical Center, LLC (“Lewis Gale”) to conduct a search of its computer systems for certain electronically stored information (“ESI”). Lewis Gale objects because of the “difficulty and unreasonable expense in performing plaintiff’s requested searches.” Alternatively, Lewis Gale asks that Wagoner pay for the related costs of conducting this search. The motion to compel is <b>GRANTED.</b></p>

<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0c90508-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">I. Background</p></div>
<p id="c0c90509-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Wagoner worked as a security guard for Lewis Gale from April 4, 2014 until he was terminated on June 12, 2014. He worked approximately 16 hours per week and earned $12.49 per hour. He filed suit against Lewis Gale on October 23, 2015, <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="486" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page486">p. 486</span>alleging that he suffered from dyslexia and that Lewis Gale wrongfully terminated his employment in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”). Wagoner asserts claims related to discrimination, retaliation, and failure to accommodate in violation of the ADA.</p>
<p id="c0c9050a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Wagoner propounded requests for production of documents to Lewis Gale seeking production of ESI maintained by two custodians, Frank Caballos and Bobby Baker, who were Wagoner’s supervisors. Wagoner limited the dates for any ESI search to only four months and requested the following search terms:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0c9050b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Jim OR Wagoner AND dyslexia OR dyslexic OR read OR reading OR slow OR ADA OR disabled OR disability OR security OR schedule OR copy OR copying.</p>
</div>
<p id="c0c9050c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lewis Gale conceded that it does not have the capability to perform this global search and obtained an estimate of $21,570 from a third-party vendor to collect the requested ESI, with an additional $24,000 estimated to review the documents retrieved. The ESI search would involve seven computers that the two custodians had access to and an exchange server located in Tennessee. Lewis Gale argues that the discovery plaintiff seeks is not proportional because Wagoner only worked for two months as a security guard, and his potential damages are less than the cost to perform the ESI search. Lewis Gale further asserts that it has produced considerable ESI in the form of “e-mails gathered manually from the computers of key custodians.”</p>

<p id="c0c92c20-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a party “may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party’s claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case.  . . . ” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b). Thus, as a threshold matter, I must determine whether Wagoner’s discovery requests are relevant under Rule 26.</p>
<p id="c0c92c21-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Wagoner contends that his dyslexia caused him to have difficulty reading and copying his posted work schedule, that Lewis Gale denied his request for a written copy of the schedule, and that his termination violated the ADA. E-mails or other memoranda written by Wagoner’s supervisors, Frank Caballos and Bobby Baker, between April and July 2014 and containing the search terms listed above are relevant to Wagoner’s claim. Indeed, Lewis Gale largely conceded at the hearing that Wagoner’s request was relevant, arguing only that the keyword searches were too broad. Accordingly, I find that Wagoner’s requested ESI search is relevant to the claims and defenses asserted in this case. . . . </p>
</div>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0c92c22-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d"><i>B. Reasonable Accessibility</i></p></div>
<p id="c0c92c23-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lewis Gale argues that the discovery in this case should not be permitted because [it] is not proportional, considering the high cost of performing the ESI search compared to Wagoner’s limited potential recovery. Lewis Gale further states that, if the court does order it to obtain the requested discovery, the court should shift the cost <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="487" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page487">p. 487</span>of the ESI search to Wagoner. Relevant ESI may still not be discoverable under Rule 26 if the party can show that the information is “not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(2)(B). The court may also specify conditions for the discovery which may include cost sharing. Here I find that Lewis Gale has not shown that the burdens and costs of obtaining the ESI discovery makes the requested information not reasonably accessible, nor has Lewis Gale shown that the requested ESI discovery is not proportional.</p>
<p id="c0c92c24-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lewis Gale claims that the fact that it cannot perform the requested ESI search in-house, and must contract with a third party vendor at significant cost, requires the court to find that the information is not reasonably accessible. Lewis relies upon the declarations of Karyn Hayes, Systems Manager for HCA Management Services, which provides computer systems services to Lewis Gale, and of Austin Maddox, Senior Litigation Technology Consultant for Document Solutions, Inc., the third-party vendor that provided an estimate to Lewis Gale for performing the ESI search. Ms. Hayes indicated that there were approximately 30,598 [responsive] e-mails. . . . She further stated that a third-party vendor would be required to perform the ESI search on seven computers located at Lewis Gale, and the “computers would require forensic extraction of data, data processing, data hosting, project management, production, and review” with an estimated cost of $45,570.00. Mr. Maddox indicated that Wagoner’s ESI request would involve:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0c92c25-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">the remote collection of at least seven laptops and email archive data. The data would be processed and loaded into a Catalyst Repository Systems web-hosted review platform. Once the data has been loaded to Catalyst, the [Document Solutions, Inc.] Client Services team would work with the hospital to cull data through objective filters (date range, email domain, file type, etc.) to identify and promote documents for review by counsel.</p>
</div>
<p id="c0c92c26-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Maddox further estimated that, “Reasonable parameters and metrics suggest that after search terms and date filters have been applied, approximately five gigabytes of data consisting of an estimated 3500 documents per gigabyte would need to be reviewed at an estimated 292 hours of expended time, which would cost approximately $24,000.”</p>
<p id="c0c92c27-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether production of documents is unduly burdensome or expensive turns primarily on whether the data is kept in an accessible or inaccessible format. Zubulake v. UBS Warburg LLC, 217 F.R.D. 309, 318 (S.D.N.Y. 2003). . . . Lewis Gale has not carried its burden to show that the data on the seven computers or exchange server is inaccessible, i.e. must be restored, de-fragmented, or reconstructed. Instead, Lewis Gale has stated that it is not capable of performing the ESI searches requested by plaintiff in-house, and would be required to contract with an expensive outside vendor.</p>
<p id="c0c92c28-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, it is difficult to conclude that the ESI sought is not proportional or “not reasonably accessible” due to undue burden and expense because Lewis Gale apparently chose to use a system that did not automatically preserve e-mails for more than three days, and did not preserve e-mails in a readily searchable format, making it costly to produce relevant e-mails when faced with a lawsuit. See AAB Joint Venture v. United States, 75 Fed. Cl. 432, 443 (2007) (noting “the Court cannot relieve Defendant of its duty to produce those documents merely because Defendant has chosen a <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="488" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page488">p. 488</span>means to preserve the evidence which makes ultimate production of relevant documents expensive.”).</p>
<p id="c0c92c29-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Proportionality consists of more than whether the particular discovery method is expensive. Here, Lewis Gale advances no other reasonable alternative to obtain the requested information. Lewis Gale simply proposes to have the very person who may have authored relevant documents search their computer for responsive information. No insurance exists that this search method would yield any ESI deleted prior to the search. Employment discovery presents particular challenges to the employees where most, and sometimes all, relevant discovery is in the control of the employer. Here, in light of the limited request, restricted by custodian, search terms, and time period, I find the request proportional to the needs of the case.</p>
<p id="c0c92c2a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, because I find that the ESI sought is reasonably accessible without undue burden or expense, cost-shifting is not appropriate. Accordingly, I will not shift the cost of discovery, and the general rule that the party responding to a discovery request bears the cost will apply.</p>

<p id="c0c95343-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff, Willy Rengifo (“Rengifo”) [who brings this action against his former employers to recover unpaid overtime wages under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and New York Labor Law, among other claims] requests this Court to issue a protective order pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(c) barring discovery related to his immigration status, social security number, and authorization to work in the United States. . . . </p>
<p id="c0c95344-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 26(c) authorizes courts, for good cause, to “make any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, including. . . . that certain matters not be inquired into, or that the scope of the disclosure or discovery be limited to certain matters. . . . ” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c). “[T]he burden is upon the party seeking non-disclosure or a protective order to show good cause.” Dove v. Atlantic Capital Corp., 963 F.2d 15, 19 (2d Cir. 1992) (citations omitted).</p>
<p id="c0c95345-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rengifo argues that discovery related to his immigration status, authorization to work in this country, and social security number are not relevant to his right to recover unpaid wages. Further, Rengifo argues that the intimidating effect of requiring disclosure of immigration status is sufficient to establish “good cause” when the question of immigration status only goes to a collateral issue. Defendants argue that documents containing Rengifo’s social security number or tax identification number, such as tax <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="489" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page489">p. 489</span>returns, are relevant to the issue of whether he is entitled to overtime wages, which is a central issue in this case. Additionally, defendants argue that the validity of Rengifo’s social security number, his immigration status and authorization to work in this country are relevant to his credibility. . . . </p>
<p id="c0c95346-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts have recognized the <i>in terrorem</i> effect of inquiring into a party’s immigration status and authorization to work in this country when irrelevant to any material claim because it presents a “danger of intimidation [that] would inhibit plaintiffs in pursuing their rights.” Liu v. Donna Karan International, Inc., 207 F. Supp. 2d 191, 193 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (citations omitted). Here, Rengifo’s immigration status and authority to work is a collateral issue. The protective order becomes necessary as “[i]t is entirely likely that any undocumented [litigant] forced to produce documents related to his or her immigration status will withdraw from the suit rather than produce such documents and face. . . . potential deportation.” Topo v. Dhir, 210 F.R.D. 76, 78 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). . . . </p>
<p id="c0c95347-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rengifo also seeks to prevent disclosure of his social security number or tax identification number. Defendants note that, in support of his claim for unpaid overtime wages, Rengifo has produced an incomplete set of pay stubs that do not reflect all of the compensation he has received from corporate defendants, and that he has not produced any records regarding the number of hours he has worked on a weekly basis. Defendants contend, therefore, that discovery of documents containing his tax identification number or social security number, such as tax returns, is necessary and relevant to obtain this information. [The court rejects defendants’ argument, reasoning that t]he information sought is not relevant to the claims in this case. Even if it were, however, the corporate defendants possess relevant data on hours and compensation, and there is no reason to assume that defendants’ records are less reliable than any records maintained by Rengifo. . . . </p>
<p id="c0c95348-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants also assert that the documents requested would allow them to test the truthfulness of Rengifo’s representations to his employer. They argue that by applying for a job and providing his social security number, Rengifo represented to defendants that he was a legal resident and they are entitled to test the truthfulness of that information. Defendants further argue that if Rengifo filed tax returns, this information would be relevant to his overtime claim, but if he failed to file tax returns, this fact would affect the veracity of statements he would potentially make at trial.</p>
<p id="c0c95349-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While it is true that credibility is always at issue, that “does not by itself warrant unlimited inquiry into the subject of immigration status when such examination would impose an undue burden on private enforcement of employment discrimination laws.” Avila-Blum v. Casa de Cambio Delgado, Inc., 236 F.R.D. 190, 192 (S.D.N.Y. 2006). A party’s attempt to discover tax identification numbers on the basis of testing credibility appears to be a back door attempt to learn of immigration status. See E.E.O.C. v. First Wireless Group, Inc., 2007 WL 586720, *2 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 20, 2007). Further, the opportunity to test the credibility of a party based on representations made when seeking employment does not outweigh the chilling effect that disclosure of immigration status has on employees seeking to enforce their rights. “While documented workers face the possibility of retaliatory discharge for an assertion of their <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="490" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page490">p. 490</span>labor and civil rights, undocumented workers confront the harsher reality that, in addition to possible discharge, their employer will likely report them to the INS and they will be subjected to deportation proceedings or criminal prosecution.” Rivera v. NIBCO, Inc., 364 F.3d 1057, 1064 (9th Cir. 2004). Granting employers the right to inquire into immigration status in employment cases would allow them to implicitly raise threats of such negative consequences when a worker reports illegal practices. <i>Id.</i> at 1065.</p>
<p id="c0c97a5a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While defendants suggest a compromise whereby discovery would be limited to the present litigation and not disclosed to any third party for any purpose beyond this litigation, the limitation does not abate the chilling effect of such disclosure. “Even if the parties were to enter into a confidentiality agreement restricting the disclosure of such discovery. . . . , there would still remain ’the danger of intimidation, the danger of destroying the cause of action’ and would inhibit plaintiffs in pursuing their rights.” <i>Liu,</i> 207 F. Supp. 2d at 193 (<i>quoting</i> Ansoumana v. Gristede’s Operating Corp., 201 F.R.D. 81 (S.D.N.Y. 2001)). This Court finds that defendants’ opportunity to test the credibility of Rengifo does not outweigh the public interest in allowing employees to enforce their rights.</p>
<p id="c0c97a5b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the foregoing reasons, Rengifo’s application for a protective order barring defendants from inquiring into his immigration status, social security number or tax identification number, and authorization to work in the United States is GRANTED.</p>

<p id="c0c9c89a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 26(b)(1) contains an explicit exception to its broad scope: It makes discoverable only “any <i>nonprivileged</i> matter that is relevant  . . . ” (emphasis added). Claims of privilege differ sharply from those grounded in proportionality and privacy. Unless waived (see below), privileges are absolute—it makes no difference that one party desperately needs the information and that it would cost nothing to disclose it; privilege is an absolute bar to discovery.</p>
<p id="c0c9c89b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So what are privileges? The law of evidence—not discovery rules—creates privileges, and you will study them in Evidence. For now a brief sketch will supply enough information to let us explore how the discovery system protects privileges.</p>
<p id="c0c9c89c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Very briefly, one can say that privileges typically protect information <i>from certain sources</i>. For example, in a criminal case the prosecutor cannot call the defendant to the stand and ask her if she committed the crime; such an action would violate the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Privileges would also protect a party’s communications with an attorney, a doctor, a member of the clergy, or a spouse. These privileges are premised on the notion that it is important to protect free communication with these sorts of people, no matter how beneficial the information would be to the public. Notice first that a privilege objection has nothing to do with relevance: whether the defendant committed the crime is highly relevant. Second, notice that although privileges typically block information from a particular source, they do not block the underlying facts. Thus, in the prosecution of a criminal case, the prosecutor will be barred by the Fifth Amendment from asking the defendant about her guilt, and barred by the attorney-client privilege from asking similar questions of her lawyer, but can introduce evidence proving the defendant’s guilt from other, unprivileged sources.</p>
<p id="c0c9c89d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A notable characteristic of evidentiary privileges is that they are not self- actuating. In other words, privileges will have effect only if a party asserts them. Moreover, privileges, even if asserted, can later be waived. To use (yet another!) illustration from <i>Haddle v. Garrison</i>, suppose in a deposition or at trial, Haddle’s lawyer <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="493" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page493">p. 493</span>asks Garrison, “What did you tell your lawyer about why you fired Michael Haddle?” If Garrison’s lawyer objects on privilege grounds, Garrison will not have to answer the question. But if—hard as it is to imagine—no objection is raised and Garrison answers the question, the attorney-client privilege will be waived, and Garrison can be asked additional questions about her communications with her lawyer. And, of course, no question of privilege arises if Garrison is simply asked, “Why did you fire Haddle?” (regardless of whether Garrison discussed this topic with her lawyer).</p>
<p id="c0c9c89e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Waiver can also result from taking some action inconsistent with claiming the privilege—such as disclosing privileged material to a third party. For example, suppose that well before suit was filed, Garrison told a friend about a conversation she had with her lawyer: That action will likely be held to be a waiver of the privilege that would otherwise apply. And, very important for our purposes, parties can waive privileges by taking certain stances in litigation. For example, Haddle waives his doctor-patient privilege with his psychologist because he has put his emotional state at issue in his suit against Garrison. Discussing all of the privileges and the conditions for their invocation and waiver would take us far beyond the scope of a course in Civil Procedure. Our focus instead is on the interaction of privileges and discovery in civil lawsuits.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0c9efb9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The potential for inadvertent waiver of privilege often can turn discovery into a haunted house with trap doors. The general rules on waiver of privilege are straightforward, and are incorporated in Rule 502 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Any privilege may be waived. Production of a privileged document—even if inadvertent—or testimony about a privileged conversation will operate as a waiver, and prevent a party from asserting the privilege as to any other privileged communications on the same subject matter, with subject matter interpreted very broadly. The purpose of this Rule is to prohibit a party from selectively waiving the privilege—that is, producing some privileged documents that tend to support the party’s position, but withholding as privileged other documents that would tend to undercut the party’s position.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0c9efba-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When privileged documents may be mixed in among nonprivileged documents, the possibility of waiver of privilege requires the producing party to review all of the documents before production, and to remove any documents that could be claimed to be privileged. Any documents removed from production based on a claim of privilege must then be listed on a “privilege log” provided to the party requesting the documents. The privilege log must provide sufficient information about the document to allow the requesting party to assess the claim of privilege and decide whether to contest the claim. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(5).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0c9efbb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These principles all worked reasonably smoothly in the world before the copy machine and digital devices. But they create major problems in an information age. In some cases, thousands or millions of documents need to be reviewed before production because of the remote possibility that one or a few of them might be privileged. If any one of the produced documents is deemed to have been privileged, even if innocuous itself, its production could be deemed to constitute a waiver of privilege as to all other documents and oral communications on the same broad subject matter. There are few things a lawyer fears more than a court determining that his production of a privileged document in discovery operated as a waiver of the privilege as to all of his communications with his client.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0c9efbc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 26(b)(5)(B) tries to address this problem of inadvertent disclosure with what has come to be known in the profession as a “claw-back” provision. Read it while hoping fervently that you will never need to be the party doing the “clawing.” Rule 16, dealing with pretrial conferences, scheduling, and case management, also allows the court to consider agreements “for asserting claims of privilege. . . . after production.”</p></li>

It may be helpful to note that when <i>Hickman v. Taylor</i> was decided, the Rules had no provision covering trial preparation materials. (Rule 26(b)(3) did not become effective until 1970.)</p>

<p id="c0ca16d7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On February 7, 1943, the tug “J.M. Taylor” sank while engaged in helping to tow a car float of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad across the Delaware River at Philadelphia. The accident was apparently unusual in nature, the cause of it still being unknown. Five of the nine crew members were drowned. Three days later the tug owners and the underwriters employed a law firm, of which respondent Fortenbaugh is a member, to defend them against potential suits by representatives of the deceased crew members and to sue the railroad for damages to the tug.</p>
<p id="c0ca16d8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A public hearing was held on March 4, 1943, before the United States Steamboat Inspectors, at which the four survivors were examined. This testimony was recorded and made available to all interested parties. Shortly thereafter, Fortenbaugh privately interviewed the survivors and took statements from them with an eye toward the anticipated litigation; the survivors signed these statements on March 29. Fortenbaugh also interviewed other persons believed to have some information relating to the accident and in some cases he made memoranda of what they told him. . . . </p>

If the answer was in the affirmative, the tug owners were then requested to set forth the nature of all such records, reports, statements, or other memoranda.</p>
<p id="c0ca16db-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The tug owners, through Fortenbaugh, answered all of the interrogatories except No. 38 and the supplemental ones just described. While admitting that statements of the survivors had been taken, they declined to summarize or set forth the contents [claiming] that such requests called “for privileged matter obtained in preparation for litigation” and constituted “an attempt to obtain indirectly counsel’s private files.” It was claimed that answering these requests “would involve practically turning over not only the complete files, but also the telephone records and, almost, the thoughts of counsel.”. . . . [The district court held that the requested matters were not privileged and ordered Fortenbaugh to produce the requested statements. He refused, and the court ordered him imprisoned until he complied (but stayed the order pending an appeal).]</p>
<p id="c0ca16dc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The pre-trial deposition-discovery mechanism established by Rules 26 to 37 is one of the most significant innovations of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. . . . Under the prior federal practice, the pre-trial functions of notice-giving issue-formulation and fact-revelation were performed primarily and inadequately by the pleadings. Inquiry into the issues and the facts before trial was narrowly confined and was often cumbersome in method. The new rules, however, restrict the pleadings to the task of general notice-giving and invest the deposition-discovery process with a vital role in the preparation for trial. . . . Thus civil trials in the federal courts no longer need be carried on in the dark. The way is now clear, consistent with recognized privileges, for the parties to obtain the fullest possible knowledge of the issues and facts before trial. . . . </p>
<p id="c0ca16dd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree, of course, that the deposition-discovery rules are to be accorded a broad and liberal treatment. No longer can the time-honored cry of “fishing expedition” serve to preclude a party from inquiring into the facts underlying his opponent’s case. Mutual knowledge of all the relevant facts gathered by both parties is essential to proper litigation. To that end, either party may compel the other to disgorge whatever facts he has in his possession. The deposition-discovery procedure simply advances the stage at which the disclosure can be compelled from the time of trial to the period preceding it, thus reducing the possibility of surprise. But discovery, like all matters of procedure, has ultimate and necessary boundaries. . . . </p>
<p id="c0ca3dee-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We. . . . agree that the memoranda, statements and mental impressions in issue in this case fall outside the scope of the attorney-client privilege and hence are not protected from discovery on that basis. . . . [T]he protective cloak of this privilege does not extend to information which an attorney secures from a witness while <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="497" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page497">p. 497</span>acting for his client in anticipation of litigation.

<p id="c0ca3def-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the impropriety of invoking that privilege does not provide an answer to the problem before us. Petitioner has made more than an ordinary request for relevant, non-privileged facts in the possession of his adversaries or their counsel. He has sought discovery as of right of oral and written statements of witnesses whose identity is well known and whose availability to petitioner appears unimpaired. He has sought production of these matters after making the most searching inquiries of his opponents as to the circumstances surrounding the fatal accident, which inquiries were sworn to have been answered to the best of their information and belief. Interrogatories were directed toward all the events prior to, during and subsequent to the sinking of the tug. Full and honest answers to such broad inquiries would necessarily have included all pertinent information gleaned by Fortenbaugh through his interviews with the witnesses. Petitioner makes no suggestion, and we cannot assume, that the tug owners or Fortenbaugh were incomplete or dishonest in the framing of their answers. In addition, petitioner was free to examine the public testimony of the witnesses taken before the United States Steamboat Inspectors. We are thus dealing with an attempt to secure the production of written statements and mental impressions contained in the files and the mind of the attorney Fortenbaugh without any showing of necessity or any indication or claim that denial of such production would unduly prejudice the preparation of petitioner’s case or cause him any hardship or injustice. For aught that appears, the essence of what petitioner seeks either has been revealed to him already through the interrogatories or is readily available to him direct from the witnesses for the asking. . . . </p>
<p id="c0ca3df0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our opinion, neither Rule 26 nor any other rule dealing with discovery contemplates production under such circumstances. . . . Not even the most liberal of discovery theories can justify unwarranted inquiries into the files and the mental impressions of an attorney.</p>
<p id="c0ca3df1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Historically, a lawyer is an officer of the court and is bound to work for the advancement of justice while faithfully protecting the rightful interests of his clients. In performing his various duties, however, it is essential that a lawyer work with a certain degree of privacy, free from unnecessary intrusion by opposing parties and their counsel. Proper preparation of a client’s case demands that he assemble information, sift what he considers to be the relevant from the irrelevant facts, prepare his legal theories and plan his strategy without undue and needless interference. That is the historical and the necessary way in which lawyers act within the framework of our system of jurisprudence to promote justice and to protect their clients’ interests. This work is reflected, of course, in interviews, statements, memoranda, correspondence, briefs, mental impressions, personal beliefs, and countless other tangible and intangible ways—aptly though roughly termed by the Circuit Court of Appeals in this case as the “work product of the lawyer.” Were such materials open to opposing counsel on mere demand, much of what is now put down in writing would remain <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="498" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page498">p. 498</span>unwritten. An attorney’s thoughts, heretofore inviolate, would not be his own. Inefficiency, unfairness and sharp practices would inevitably develop in the giving of legal advice and in the preparation of cases for trial. The effect on the legal profession would be demoralizing. And the interests of the clients and the cause of justice would be poorly served.</p>
<p id="c0ca3df2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not mean to say that all written materials obtained or prepared by an adversary’s counsel with an eye toward litigation are necessarily free from discovery in all cases. Where relevant and non-privileged facts remain hidden in an attorney’s file and where production of those facts is essential to the preparation of one’s case, discovery may properly be had. Such written statements and documents might, under certain circumstances, be admissible in evidence or give clues as to the existence or location of relevant facts. Or they might be useful for purposes of impeachment or corroboration. And production might be justified where the witnesses are no longer available or can be reached only with difficulty. . . . </p>
<p id="c0ca3df3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But as to oral statements made by witnesses to Fortenbaugh, whether presently in the form of his mental impressions or memoranda, we do not believe that any showing of necessity can be made under the circumstances of this case so as to justify production. . . . </p>
<p id="c0ca3df4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Denial of production of this nature does not mean that any material, non- privileged facts can be hidden from the petitioner in this case. He need not be unduly hindered in the preparation of his case, in the discovery of facts or in his anticipation of his opponents’ position. Searching interrogatories directed to Fortenbaugh and the tug owners, production of written documents and statements upon a proper showing and direct interviews with the witnesses themselves all serve to reveal the facts in Fortenbaugh’s possession to the fullest possible extent consistent with public policy. Petitioner’s counsel frankly admits that he wants the oral statements only to help prepare himself to examine witnesses and to make sure that he has overlooked nothing. That is insufficient under the circumstances to permit him an exception to the policy underlying the privacy of Fortenbaugh’s professional activities. If there should be a rare situation justifying production of these matters, petitioner’s case is not of that type. . . . </p>

<p id="c0ca3df6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Counsel for the petitioner candidly said on argument that he wanted this information to help prepare himself to examine witnesses, to make sure he overlooked nothing. He bases his claim to it in his brief on the view that the Rules were to do away with the old situation where a law suit developed into “a battle of wits between counsel.” But a common law trial is and always should be an adversary proceeding. Discovery was hardly intended to enable a learned profession to perform its functions either without wits or on wits borrowed from the adversary.</p>
<p id="c0ca3df7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The real purpose and the probable effect of the practice ordered by the district court would be to put trials on a level even lower than a “battle of wits.” I can conceive of no practice more demoralizing to the Bar than to require a lawyer to write out and deliver to his adversary an account of what witnesses have told him. . . . </p>

One way to think of trial preparation material is as rough drafts of that story—drafts that may be discarded or revised as thought and information come to it. Eventually, at summary judgment or trial, the lawyer will need to settle on a coherent story and tell it in public. Until that happens, trial preparation protection lets the lawyer keep the rough drafts to herself—unless special circumstances exist.</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0ca8b28-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the time of <i>Hickman</i>, Rule 26 did not deal specifically with the topic of trial preparation materials. It now does—dealing both with “general” trial preparation <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="500" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page500">p. 500</span>protections in Rule 26(b)(3) and with the special issues of trial preparation protection for expert witnesses (dealt with in the next section of this chapter). The Rules also incorporate the qualified nature of protections for trial preparation materials, allowing disclosure of the information if its substantial equivalent cannot be obtained without significant hardship. See Rules 26(b)(3) and 26(b)(4)(D).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0ca8b29-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 26(b)(3) protects from disclosure “documents and tangible things that are prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party or its representatives.” Not surprisingly, disputes arise over whether a document has been prepared “in anticipation of litigation.” A diary entry, written by a party, is unlikely to fall in this category; notes from a lawyer’s interview of that party most certainly will. Although both may concern the incident that gives rise to litigation, only the latter was prepared in anticipation of that litigation. There are also closer questions concerning whether internal reports of incidents were made as part of the regular course of business or in anticipation of litigation. Suppose that in <i>Haddle v. Garrison</i> Healthmaster has a Human Resources department and someone from that department interviewed Haddle shortly before he was fired and wrote a report. Prepared in anticipation of litigation? Compare Rakus v. Erie-Lackawanna Railroad, 76 F.R.D. 145 (W.D.N.Y. 1977) (employees’ accident reports to claims department are discoverable) and Nesselrotte v. Allegheny Energy Inc., 242 F.R.D. 338 (W.D.

<p id="c0cab242-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another specialized form of trial preparation involves expert witnesses and, as with trial preparation, the Rules call out expert testimony for special treatment. Experts enter civil litigation in two ways. In some cases experts may participate in events that give rise to litigation. Imagine that City designs and builds a bridge over a busy road connecting two parts of a university campus; the bridge later collapses, killing a number of people. Wrongful death litigation may focus on flaws in design and construction. In such a case the engineers and builders who designed and built the bridge, though experts in their fields, will be “fact witnesses” in the same way as those who saw it collapse. These experts will be subject to all the ordinary stages of discovery and will for the most part be treated in the same way as a bystander who witnessed the bridge’s collapse.</p>
<p id="c0cab243-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A second kind of expert—the kind on which the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure focus—enters the picture if parties in the bridge collapse hire experts—to testify, for example, about the design or construction of the bridge. Experts hired (or “retained” in the more elegant language of the Rules) for the purposes of litigation can range from the standard professionals—physicians, accountants, engineers—to experts in “accident reconstruction” and “brand name identification.” Such hired experts typically testify to the inferences one can draw about the causes or effects of an event by applying their special knowledge to the information available.</p>
<p id="c0cab244-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In order to understand the procedural rules applicable to this second type of expert, it may help to have a quick sketch of how lawyers might use them in litigation. Let’s return to the bridge collapse scenario as a framework. If litigation ensues, both sides will likely want to use engineers’ testimony. The City might want an engineer to support a possible argument the bridge was in all ways properly designed but the contractor it hired cut corners that caused the collapse; the plaintiff will likely want to show that the City’s design was based on a new and insufficiently tested concept that proved defective. To support these duelling contentions the parties will seek out independent experts—perhaps from civil engineering faculties of universities (other than the one affected, of course). Locating and hiring such experts is an important part of case preparation: One wants not only someone with impressive credentials but someone who will make a good impression on the trier of fact. Having located such a person, each lawyer will have initial consultations, presenting their expert with information relating to the bridge’s design. And here things can go well or badly. Well if the expert’s initial impressions support the lawyer’s theory; badly if the expert thinks otherwise—or seems unlikely to make the right impression on a judge or <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="502" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page502">p. 502</span>jury. Even if all goes well with the expert, her report is likely to go through multiple drafts as the expert and the lawyer shape it to support a persuasive claim or defense. As we’ll see, Rule 26(b)(4) now takes account of each of these possibilities.</p>
<p id="c0cab245-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Just as Rule 26(a) requires parties to disclose witnesses and information they may use to support their claims, Rule 26(a)(2) sets requirements for disclosure of expert witnesses. Rule 26(a)(2)(D) requires that 90 days before trial (or 30 days for rebuttal testimony) the parties identify experts who may testify. This disclosure rule reflects the expectation that lawyers will want to depose the other side’s expert—most likely after consulting with their own.</p>
<p id="c0cab246-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 26(a)(2) then implicitly divides experts into two groups: experts who must provide an elaborate written report (26(a)(2)(B)) and those who need not (26(a)(2)(C)). The division roughly corresponds to the distinction made above—between “fact witness” experts (e.g., the engineers who designed the bridge in the hypothetical above) and those who were hired specially for the lawsuit (e.g., engineers hired to testify about proper bridge design). The latter must produce an elaborate written report, the former not. But, because even non-retained experts are experts, and it will be very difficult for the opposing lawyer effectively to depose or examine them, Rule 26(a)(2)(C) requires, as part of the pretrial disclosures, that even “fact witness” experts summarize “facts and opinions” to which they expect to testify. (The Rule is silent as to who will write this summary, and one imagines that, in practice, it will often be the lawyers who want to call the witnesses.) After producing their report, experts can be deposed by opposing counsel. Rules 26(a)(2), 26(b)(4). These reports and the ensuing depositions will often be the last significant discovery events.</p>
<p id="c0cab247-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Expert witnesses can serve a third role in litigation; as advisers to the attorney who retained them. Sometimes experts (jury consultants, for example) may be hired in anticipation of litigation but with no expectation of ever testifying at trial. Other times, an expert might be consulted with the expectation that he would testify at trial—he might even prepare a report—but the lawyer might decide not to call him as a witness.</p>
<p id="c0cab248-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 26(b)(4) addresses work product problems surrounding experts. The Rule contains special provisions for retained experts and their communications with lawyers as they prepare their reports and testimony. Both the defense and plaintiff bars agree that it is important to extend work product protection to drafts of experts’ opinions; the current Rule does so. Rule 26(b)(4)(D) protects reports and opinions by witnesses retained in anticipation of litigation who will not testify, with exceptions similar to those in Rule 23(b)(3) for trial preparation materials.</p>

<p id="c0cad96d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This cause is before the Court on Plaintiff’s Motion for Protective Order filed on May 13, 1994 (hereinafter Motion). Plaintiff seeks to shield from discovery documents related to her in the possession of Lauren Lucas, Ph.D., a psychologist. She contends that Rule 26(b)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) protects the psychological records in Dr. Lucas’ possession. In particular, Plaintiff represents Dr. Lucas was retained by her prior counsel to perform a diagnostic review and personality profile, and that, after seeing Plaintiff on one occasion on June 15, 1992, Dr. Lucas prepared a report for her prior counsel.</p>

<p id="c0cad972-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Assuming arguendo that Dr. Lucas’ report is covered by Rule 26(b)(4), it would nevertheless be discoverable under the circumstances presented in this case. In the instant lawsuit, Plaintiff alleges that, as a result of sexual harassment by co-defendant Zona, a supervisor in the employ of the Defendant, she was “reduced to a severely depressed emotional state and her employment was terminated when she did not acquiesce to the advances of [Zona].” According to a complaint filed with the Jacksonville Equal Opportunity Commission, Plaintiff apparently was terminated from her position with Defendant Haskell Company on June 5, 1992. Thus, her mental and emotional state ten days later on June 15, 1992, the date on which she was examined by Dr. Lucas, is highly probative with regard to the above-quoted allegation, which is essential to her case.</p>
<p id="c0cad973-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This highly probative information is discoverable notwithstanding Rule 26(b)(4), moreover, given the nature of the report at issue. Apparently, no other comparable report was prepared during the weeks immediately following Plaintiff’s discharge. Thus, the Defendant could not obtain the information contained in Dr. Lucas’ report by other means. In a case almost on all fours with the instant one, the Court recognized that even “independent examinations. . . . pursuant to Rule 35 would not <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="505" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page505">p. 505</span>contain equivalent information.” Dixon v. Cappellini, 88 F.R.D. 1, 3 (M.D. Pa. 1980).

<p id="c0cad979-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is a maritime action in which the shipper, Chiquita International Ltd. (“Chiquita”), sues the carrier, International Reefer Services, S.A. (“International Reefer”), for cargo loss and damage. Chiquita alleges that International Reefer was engaged to transport 154,660 boxes of bananas from Puerto Bolivar, Ecuador to Bremerhaven, Germany aboard the M/V Bolero Reefer. However, because of alleged malfunctions of the vessel’s loading cranes and side-ports, only 111,660 boxes were loaded. Thus, 43,000 boxes of bananas were left on the wharf and were later disposed of. The cargo that did arrive in Germany was allegedly in poor condition.</p>
<p id="c0cad97a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">International Reefer has submitted a letter in support of an application to compel discovery of Joseph Winer. Mr. Winer is a marine surveyor [a type of expert familiar with ship design and maintenance] who examined the vessel and loading gear at Chiquita’s request shortly after the vessel arrived in Bremerhaven. International Reefer seeks Mr. Winer’s deposition and production of the file he assembled in connection with his inspection. Chiquita has objected to these demands on the ground that Mr. Winer is a non-testifying expert as to whom discovery is closely circumscribed by Rule 26(b)(4)([D]) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. International Reefer replies that Mr. Winer is a fact witness rather than an expert. Moreover, even if he is an expert, International Reefer argues that the fact that he is the only surveyor who observed the vessel shortly after it docked is an exceptional circumstance warranting discovery. . . . </p>
<p id="c0cad97b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The opinion quotes Rule 26(b)(4)(D).]</p>
<p id="c0cad97c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[A] non-testifying expert is generally immune from discovery.</p>
<p id="c0cad97d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Winer qualifies as such an expert. He is a marine engineer who was specifically engaged by Chiquita to examine the vessel in connection with the cargo loss claim. He is clearly an “expert” in that he brought his technical background to bear in observing the condition of the gear and offering his opinion to Chiquita. He does not forfeit this status merely because he made a personal examination of the vessel and therefore learned “facts,” rather than simply offering an opinion based on the observations of others. Rule 26(b)(4)[(D)] generally precludes discovery of “facts known or opinions” held by a non-testifying expert, and so it anticipates that such an expert may make his or her own investigation. Thus, the relevant distinction is not between fact and opinion testimony but between those witnesses whose information was obtained in the normal course of business and those who were hired to make an evaluation in connection with expected litigation. See Harasimowicz v. McAllister, 78 F.R.D. 319, 320 (E.D. Pa. 1978) (medical examiner subject to ordinary discovery on <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="506" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page506">p. 506</span>routine autopsy); Congrove v. St. Louis-San Francisco Railway, 77 F.R.D. 503, 504-05 (W.D. Mo. 1978) (treating physician subject to ordinary discovery). Here, Mr. Winer falls into the latter category and Rule 26(b)(4)[(D)] therefore applies.</p>
<p id="c0cad97e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">International Reefer nevertheless contends that discovery should be permitted under the “exceptional circumstances” clause of the rule, since no other marine surveyor viewed the vessel shortly after docking. This argument would have merit if International Reefer had been precluded from sending its own expert to the scene by forces beyond its control. Thus, for example, in [another case] the court found there to be exceptional circumstances where the plaintiff allowed its own expert to examine the item at issue while barring the defendant’s experts until the item was no longer accessible.</p>
<p id="c0cb008f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, that is not the case here. The vessel and equipment were at least as available to International Reefer as to Chiquita from the time of loading. Indeed, during the three-week voyage to Bremerhaven, International Reefer’s employees had the exclusive opportunity to examine the loading cranes. Under these circumstances, the failure of International Reefer to engage its own marine surveyor in a timely manner should not be rewarded by permitting discovery of Chiquita’s expert. To do so would permit the exceptional circumstances exception to swallow Rule 26(b)(4)[(D)].</p>
<p id="c0cb0090-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, International Reefer maintains that even if it is foreclosed from deposing Mr. Winer, it should be given access to his file. However, Rule 26(b)(4)[(D)] applies to document discovery as well as to depositions. Nevertheless, International Reefer is correct that information does not become exempt from discovery merely because it is conveyed to a non-testifying expert. Thus, while the file may contain Mr. Winer’s recorded observations and opinions which need not be disclosed, it may also include discoverable information provided to Mr. Winer by others. Such documents shall be produced.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0cb27ad-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Chiquita</i>, the court says there is no question that Mr. Winer is an expert “retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony in the case” (Rule 26(b)(4)(D)). In <i>Thompson</i>, the court suggests in passing that Dr. Lucas might not be such a specially retained expert: “Assuming arguendo that Dr. Lucas’ report is covered by Rule 26[(b)(4))], it would nevertheless be discoverable under the circumstances presented in this case.” If Dr. Lucas was not a specially retained expert, but instead treated Thompson and in the course of that treatment discussed facts related to her sexual harassment claim, would her report be discoverable?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0cb27ae-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why did the <i>Chiquita</i> plaintiff think it mattered that the surveyor/expert had actually inspected the vessel?

Lawyer: “Doctor, suppose a patient came to you complaining of severe abdominal pain; what would be the preferred course of diagnosis?” Expert: “First one would perform a test to rule out appendicitis; then  . . . ” In <i>Chiquita</i>, the expert examined the actual “patient” (here the ship), and the plaintiff argued that this moved him from the usual expert to a fact witness, an argument the court rejected.</p></li>

<p id="c0cb27b1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With all this guidance from Rules and case law, what could possibly go wrong? Plenty, it turns out. We do not know how often discovery results in controversy and conflict. A survey conducted by the nonpartisan Federal Judicial Center in 2009 found that lawyers on both sides of the “v” reported that “the disclosure and discovery [in their cases] generated ’the right amount’ of information” and that “expenditures for discovery, including attorney fees, amounted at the median 1.6% of the reported stakes for plaintiff[s] and 3.3% [for defendants].”</p>
<p id="c0cb27b2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nevertheless, even a cursory review of federal district court opinions reveals all sorts of bad behavior during discovery. Delay, evasiveness, abusive use of various discovery devices, use of discovery to buy time or to force a hard-pressed opponent to settle for less, are just some tactics that can be observed. Such depressing behavior has several sources, some of which lie in the design of the discovery system itself. The Federal Rules envisioned discovery would operate largely without judicial supervision, and the Rules therefore speak of lawyers exchanging various discovery requests without intervention by courts. There is a debate within the profession <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="508" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page508">p. 508</span>about whether and how much judges should become involved with discovery early in a lawsuit, but at present that remains a judge’s choice rather than a command of the Rules.</p>

<p id="c0cb4ec5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before assessing the effectiveness of court interventions, it may help to understand some types of disagreements that become full-fledged discovery disputes. One common subject of dispute is the proper scope of discovery. Reverting to the hypothetical in Chapter 1, imagine that Peters has sued Dodge for injuries resulting from an auto accident. Dodge asks Peters for documents reflecting all of Peters’s medical treatments for the past ten years. Peters objects: He believes that the request is overbroad—not “proportionate” in the language of Rule 26(b)(1)—and that at least some of the documents requested are privileged. Dodge maintains that the request is appropriate, as past medical records would indicate whether some of the injuries claimed by Peters predated the accident. In Peters’s view, Dodge has abused the discovery tools by asking for more information than the claim justifies. In Dodge’s view, Peters is stonewalling—resisting appropriate requests for discovery.</p>
<p id="c0cb4ec6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A second common subject of dispute concerns whether a party has lost or destroyed important evidence. Until recently, the Rules did not expressly address this type of problem, but the common law did. Now, the Rules do as well, at least concerning electronic discovery. Read Rule 37(e). Under the common law and now the Rules, parties are obligated to preserve evidence relevant to pending or reasonably foreseeable litigation. The failure to preserve or destruction of this type of evidence is called <i>spoliation</i>. Recall <i>Zubulake</i>, with which this chapter began: an employment discrimination case in which the plaintiff accused the defendant of destroying some e-mails relevant to the case.</p>

<p id="c0cb4ec9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All discovery methods need enforcement mechanisms. The Rules provide means of enforcing compliance by both the propounding and the answering party. Rule 26(g), like Rule 11, requires that discovery requests and responses be signed, and states that the signature implies discovery requests are reasonable and discovery responses are complete. Unlike Rule 11, Rule 26(g) suggests that attorneys’ fees will be an appropriate sanction for most violations of its obligations.</p>
<p id="c0cb4eca-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 37 establishes a system of sanctions for parties violating more specific obligations. Under that Rule, a court may impose punishments ranging from awards of expenses to dismissals of an entire case or the entry of a default judgment. Some sanctions are available on the occurrence of misbehavior. See Rule 37(d), (f). Other sanctions cannot be sought until after the court has ordered a party to comply, but it has refused. See Rule 37(b). And, as we have discussed, the failure to preserve electronically stored information has its own rule regarding sanctions. See Rule 37(e).</p>

Read Rule 37(b)(2); it gives courts wide latitude to determine appropriate sanctions for discovery violations, including dismissal of claims, limiting the evidence parties can use at trial, and awards of attorneys’ fees. Yet Rule 37 places additional limits on a court’s ability to impose sanctions for “electronically stored information that should have been preserved in anticipation of litigation.” <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="511" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page511">p. 511</span>The Rule imposes two principal limits: In (e)(1) it specifies that sanctions be “not greater than necessary to cure the prejudice” produced by the missing records; in (e)(2) it requires, for the imposition of the most serious sanctions, a finding that “the party acted with the intent to deprive another party of the information’s use in litigation.” The latter amendment was criticized at the time of its proposal, on the ground that it encouraged parties to be “merely” negligent in their preservation efforts. Consider how the court applies this new Rule in the next case.</p>

<p id="c0cb9d04-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this tort action pending under the Court’s diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. §1332, Plaintiff pursues claims against all Defendants for tortious interference with his employment contract and with related business expectancies, while Defendant–Counter Claimant Taylor Swift (“Swift”) pursues counterclaims for the torts of assault and battery. Now before the Court is Plaintiff’s Motion for Sanctions for Plaintiff’s Spoliation of Evidence. As explained below, Defendants’ Motion is granted in part, to impose a spoliation sanction that is less harsh than the adverse inference requested by Defendants, but which the Court finds is the most appropriate sanction in the circumstances of this case. . . . </p>
<p id="c0cb9d05-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he additional background set out below is both undisputed and supported by evidence in the record. Plaintiff worked as an on-air radio personality for a Denver area radio station, KYGO. On June 2, 2013, he attended a backstage “meet and greet” preceding a concert performed by Swift at Denver’s Pepsi Center. As detailed in the summary judgment order, Swift alleges that during a staged photo opportunity at the “meet and greet,” Plaintiff purposefully and inappropriately touched her buttocks beneath her dress. Plaintiff denies having done so.</p>
<p id="c0cb9d06-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff’s employer, the company that owned KYGO, was informed of Swift’s accusation on the evening of June 2, 2013 and on the following day. On June 3, 2013, Plaintiff met with his superiors at KYGO, including Robert Call (“Call”) and Hershel Coomer (a/k/a “Eddie Haskell”) (“Haskell”). Unbeknownst to Call and Haskell at the time, Plaintiff made an audio recording of their conversation. The following day, June 4, 2013, Plaintiff was terminated from his employment at KYGO by Call. Call explained that one reason for Plaintiff’s termination was because Call perceived Plaintiff had “changed his story that it couldn’t have occurred, then that it was incidental.”</p>
<p id="c0cb9d07-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At some point thereafter, well after having first contacted an attorney regarding potential legal action, Plaintiff edited the audio recording of the June 3, 2013 conversation, and then sent only “clips” of the entire audio file to his attorney. In his deposition testimony, Plaintiff offered the following explanation for these actions: “[t]he audio I recorded was close to two hours long. And the audio that I could provide to [Plaintiff’s counsel] was a portion of the entire audio,” and “it was so long, that I edited down clips from the recording to provide to [Plaintiff’s counsel] to give an idea of what kind of questioning I went. . . . through.”</p>
<p id="c0cb9d08-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to his testimony, Plaintiff edited the audio file on his laptop computer, on which he also retained a full copy of the original audio file(s). However, <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="512" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page512">p. 512</span>sometime thereafter, coffee was spilled on the keyboard of Plaintiff’s laptop, damaging it. Plaintiff took the laptop to the Apple Store, and was given “a new machine.” He did not keep the original hard drive or recover the files from it. Evidently this occurred sometime in 2015. In addition, although Plaintiff kept an external hard drive “to store audio files and documents,” and the complete audio recording was saved on this drive, at some point it “stopped working.” At his deposition, Plaintiff testified that he “may have kept” this hard drive, but that because it was “useless” he “[didn’t] know if I discarded it because it was junk.” It has not been produced.</p>
<p id="c0cb9d09-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The end result of all this is that the complete audio recording of the June 3, 2013 conversation among Plaintiff, Call, and Haskell has never been produced. . . . As a result, Defendants move for a Court-imposed sanction for spoliation of evidence, and in particular for the Court to give the jury an adverse inference instruction at trial, to direct the jury “that the entirety of the June 3, 2013 audio recording would have been unfavorable to Plaintiff.”</p>
<p id="c0cb9d0a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“A spoliation sanction is proper where: ‘(1) a party has a duty to preserve evidence because it knew, or should have known, that litigation was imminent, and (2) the adverse party was prejudiced by the destruction of the evidence.’” In deciding whether to sanction a party for the spoliation of evidence, courts have considered a variety of factors, but two “generally carry the most weight: (1) the degree of culpability of the party who lost or destroyed the evidence; and (2) the degree of actual prejudice to the other party.”  . . . </p>

<p id="c0cb9d0f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Initially, Plaintiff does not dispute that he knew or should have known that litigation was imminent and that he was therefore under a duty to preserve relevant evidence, including the complete audio recording, at the time when he first altered it for his own purposes and then lost or destroyed the unedited file. <i>See</i> Zubulake v. UBS Warburg LLC, 220 F.R.D. 212, 216 (S.D.N.Y. 2003). . . . </p>
<p id="c0cbc420-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Indeed, it is quite likely that the reason Plaintiff secretively recorded his conversation with Call and Haskell was because he knew that some form of adversarial legal action was likely to follow.</p>
<p id="c0cbc421-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, Plaintiff later edited the audio file in order to send “clips” to his own attorney, when it was abundantly clear that litigation was imminent, because Plaintiff himself was actively considering it. . . . </p>

<p id="c0cbc423-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court also readily concludes that the recording of the June 3, 2013 conversation was relevant to numerous disputed facts and issues in this case. For instance, to prevail on his tortious interference claims, Plaintiff must prove that Defendants’ communication with KYGO was improper, and that Defendants’ conduct caused <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="513" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page513">p. 513</span>KYGO to terminate him. The statements made by Plaintiff and by Messrs. Call and Haskell the day following the incident with Swift and the day before KYGO fired him would plainly be relevant to proving or disproving those facts. Moreover, the record reflects that one of the reasons Mr. Call decided to terminate Plaintiff was because he perceived that Plaintiff had “changed his story” during the course of his communications with KYGO. A recording of this conversation could be invaluable to a jury that will be asked to decide, in part, whether they agree with Mr. Call’s assessment that Plaintiff has been inconsistent in his descriptions of the events of June 2, 2013. . . . </p>

<p id="c0cbc425-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court similarly finds that Defendants were prejudiced by the loss of evidence. At the very least, if the complete recording had been available, it might have saved time and expense in litigation by documenting the June 3, 2013 conversation, allowing for better preparation for depositions and ultimately for trial. Moreover, to the extent there may now be discrepancies in the accounts that Plaintiff and Messrs. Call and Haskill give regarding their June 3, 2013 conversation, the recording would probably have resolved them. . . . </p>

<p id="c0cbc427-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the Court finds that the degree of culpability warrants a sanction. Although the Court declines to make a finding that Plaintiff acted in “bad faith” in the sense that he <i>intended</i> to destroy the evidence, it also cannot characterize the loss or destruction of evidence in this case as innocent, or as “<i>mere</i> negligence.” Rather, the spoliation falls higher up on the “continuum of fault.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c0cbc428-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff knew full well that litigation was imminent, since he was pursuing it. He knew that he was the only person in possession of the complete audio recording. He made the decision—inexplicably, in the Court’s view—to <i>alter</i> the original evidence and to present his lawyer with only “clips” hand-picked from the underlying evidence. This reflects that he obviously intended to make use of portions of the recording to advance his own claims. . . . Plaintiff could and should have made sure that <i>some</i> means of backing up the files relevant to litigation was in place, but this was not done.</p>
<p id="c0cbc429-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, when Plaintiff surrendered his laptop for repair or replacement, he knew that it contained relevant evidence. Depending on whether this occurred before or after the loss of his external hard drive (the record is unclear), the laptop contained either the only remaining copy of the complete audio file or one of only two, as Plaintiff also knew or should have known. Despite this, the record does not reflect that he made any effort to retain the hard drive, to have it returned to him after he surrendered the damaged laptop, or to otherwise recover the lost file(s). The same was true when his external hard drive stopped working. Rather than saving it, seeking to have it repaired, or taking steps to preserve the files stored on it, Plaintiff evidently just set the drive aside, and eventually lost it. . . . </p>

<p id="c0cbc42b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite the discussion of Plaintiff’s culpability above, the Court rejects Defendants’ request to make a finding of bad faith and to give the jury an adverse inference instruction. Having considered various options, and after directing Defendants to <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="514" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page514">p. 514</span>brief the issue of alternative sanctions, the Court finds that the following sanction is appropriate: <i>Notwithstanding any limitations under Federal Rule of Evidence 611(b), Defendants will be permitted to cross-examine Plaintiff in front of the jury regarding the record of his spoliation of evidence, as described above</i>.</p>
<p id="c0cbc42c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court concludes this is the most appropriate sanction for several reasons. <i>First</i>, while Plaintiff is culpable, the Court does not find that the nature of that culpability warrants an adverse inference instruction. Although a threshold finding of bad faith is a prerequisite for an adverse inference, the Court does not view bad faith as a binary or “yes/no” issue. . . . [T]he record does not establish—at least not clearly—that Plaintiff was acting with an <i>intent</i> to deprive Defendants of relevant evidence. Absent a more clear showing that Plaintiff’s conduct reflected his own “consciousness of a weak case,” an adverse inference instruction is not appropriate. [Citing case]; <i>see also</i> Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e)(2) (as to electronically stored information, adverse inference jury instruction is permissible “only upon [a] finding that the party acted with the intent to deprive another party of the information’s use in litigation.”). . . . </p>
<p id="c0cbc42d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[A]llowing Defendants to cross examine Plaintiff about his spoliation of evidence has the benefit of allowing the jury to make its own assessment of Plaintiff’s degree of culpability and of the actual prejudice to Defendants. The Court has little doubt that if the jury concludes Plaintiff acted with bad faith or an intention to destroy or conceal evidence, they will draw their own adverse inferences, whether the Court instructs it or not. In this case where Plaintiff’s credibility is critical to his claims, allowing cross-examination regarding his spoliation of evidence, including the fact that he personally chose and edited the “clips” now available to the jury is therefore quite a heavy sanction. On the other hand, if the jury is persuaded that Plaintiff’s actions were indeed innocent, then the impact of the Court’s sanction will be far less harsh. . . . </p>
<p id="c0cbc42e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he remedial and punitive impact of the Court’s sanction will follow from the jury’s own findings and credibility determinations, rather than from findings by the Court on the basis of only the written record. . . . </p>
<p id="c0cbc42f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For all these reasons, the Court concludes in the exercise of its discretion that among all the many possible sanctions it might impose, the one set forth above is properly suited to the circumstances of this case, is no more onerous than is necessary to serve its purposes, and best serves the interests of justice.</p>

In some cases courts have either dismissed the complaint (the ultimate sanction for a plaintiff) or ordered judgment for the plaintiff (the corresponding sanction for a defendant).

In a footnote edited from the opinion reproduced here, Judge Martínez tersely noted, “The Court takes an even more dim view of Plaintiff’s counsel’s unexplained failure to obtain, listen to, preserve, and produce the complete audio file, but that is a separate issue from whether Plaintiff should be sanctioned.” In <i>Zubulake</i>, with which the chapter began, Judge Scheindlin had a good deal more to say about lawyers’ continuing obligation to assure that digital evidence be preserved. In the next case, which does not involve e-discovery, the judge focuses on a lawyer’s excessive gamesmanship during discovery and crafts a unique sanction to address this behavior.</p></li>

<p id="c0cbeb52-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Discovery—a process intended to facilitate the free flow of information between parties—is now too often mired in obstructionism. Today’s “litigators” are quick to <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="516" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page516">p. 516</span>dispute discovery requests, slow to produce information, and all-too-eager to object at every stage of the process. They often object using boilerplate language containing every objection imaginable, despite the fact that courts have resoundingly disapproved of such boilerplate objections. Some litigators do this to grandstand for their client, to intentionally obstruct the flow of clearly discoverable information, to try and win a war of attrition, or to intimidate and harass the opposing party. Others do it simply because it’s how they were taught. . . . Whatever the reason, obstructionist discovery conduct is born of a warped view of zealous advocacy, often formed by insecurities and fear of the truth. This conduct fuels the astronomically costly litigation industry at the expense of “the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 1. It persists because most litigators and a few real trial lawyers—even very good ones, like the lawyers in this case—have come to accept it as part of the routine chicanery of federal discovery practice.</p>
<p id="c0cbeb53-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the litigators and trial lawyers do not deserve all the blame for obstructionist discovery conduct because judges so often ignore this conduct, and by doing so we reinforce—even <i>incentivize</i>—obstructionist tactics. . . . Unless judges impose serious adverse consequences, like court-imposed sanctions, litigators’ conditional reflexes will persist. The point of court-imposed sanctions is to stop reinforcing winning through obstruction.</p>
<p id="c0cbeb54-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While obstructionist tactics pervade all aspects of pretrial discovery, this case involves discovery abuse perpetrated during depositions. Earlier this year, in preparation for a hard-fought product liability jury trial, I was called upon by the parties to rule on numerous objections to deposition transcripts that the parties intended to use at trial. I noticed that the deposition transcripts were littered with what I perceived to be meritless objections made by one of the defendant’s lawyers, whom I refer to here as “Counsel.” I was shocked by what I read. Thus, for the reasons discussed below, I find that Counsel’s deposition conduct warrants sanctions. . . . </p>
<p id="c0cbeb55-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The court describes “hundreds of unnecessary objections and interruptions” by Counsel during depositions, most of which “completely lacked merit and often ended up influencing how the witnesses responded to questions."]</p>
<p id="c0cbeb56-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Based on Counsel’s deposition conduct, I would be well within my discretion to impose substantial monetary sanctions on Counsel. But I am less interested in negatively affecting Counsel’s pocketbook than I am in positively affecting Counsel’s obstructive deposition practices. I am also interested in deterring others who might be inclined to comport themselves similarly to Counsel. . . . Deterrence is especially important given that so many litigators are <i>trained</i> to make obstructionist objections. For instance, at trial, when I challenged Counsel’s use of “form” objections, Counsel responded, “Well, I’m sorry, Your Honor, but that was my training. . . . ” While monetary sanctions are certainly warranted for Counsel’s witness coaching and excessive interruptions, a more outside-the-box sanction may better serve the goal of changing improper tactics that modern litigators are trained to use. <i>See</i> Matthew L. Jarvey, Note, <i>Boilerplate Discovery Objections: How They Are Used, Why They Are Wrong, and What We Can Do About Them,</i> 61 Drake L. Rev. 913, 931-36 (2013) (discussing the importance of unorthodox sanctions in deterring discovery abuse).</p>
<p id="c0cbeb57-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In light of this goal, I impose the following sanction: Counsel must write and produce a training video in which Counsel, or another partner in Counsel’s firm, <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="517" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page517">p. 517</span>appears and explains the holding and rationale of this opinion, and provides specific steps lawyers must take to comply with its rationale in future depositions in any federal and state court. . . . The lawyer in the video must state that the video is being produced and distributed pursuant to a federal court’s sanction order regarding a partner in the firm, but the lawyer need not state the name of the partner, the case the sanctions arose under, or the court issuing this order. Upon completing the video, Counsel must file it with this court, under seal, for my review and approval. If and when I approve the video, Counsel must (1) notify certain lawyers at Counsel’s firm about the video via e-mail and (2) provide those lawyers with access to the video. The lawyers who must receive this notice and access include each lawyer at Counsel’s firm—including its branch offices worldwide—who engages in federal or state litigation or who works in any practice group in which at least two of the lawyers have filed an appearance in any state or federal case in the United States. After providing these lawyers with notice of and access to the video, Counsel must file in this court, under seal, (1) an affidavit certifying that Counsel complied with this order and received no assistance (other than technical help or help from the lawyer appearing in the video) in creating the video’s content and (2) a copy of the e-mail notifying the appropriate lawyers in Counsel’s firm about the video. . . . Failure to comply with this order within 90 days may result in additional sanctions. . . . </p>
<p id="c0cbeb58-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Depositions can be stressful and contentious, and lawyers are bound to make the occasional improper objection. But Counsel’s improper objections, coaching, and interruptions went far beyond what judges should tolerate of any lawyer, let alone one as experienced and skilled as Counsel. . . . For the reasons stated in this opinion, I find that sanctions are appropriate in response to Counsel’s improper deposition conduct, which impeded, delayed, and frustrated the fair examination of witnesses in the depositions related to this case that Counsel defended. I therefore impose the sanction described above.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0cc1270-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Eighth Circuit, in reversing, did not remand the case to the lower court, concluding that “a remand would have little value.

<p id="c0cc1273-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having looked at some of the obstacles to the smooth functioning of discovery, step back and consider its place in the larger scheme. The Supreme Court’s recent glosses on Rule 8 (in <i>Twombly</i> and <i>Iqbal</i>) will prevent some cases from reaching discovery. For those that do, discovery will unearth information the parties need for trial—even as that same discovery may reduce the likelihood that trial will occur. The next two chapters illuminate this paradox. Chapter 8 looks at formal and informal ways in which parties may avoid trial. Chapter 9 looks at what happens during trial itself.</p>
<p id="c0cc1274-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The paradoxical consequences of discovery flow from its dual role. It aims to prevent surprise at trial and to assure that cases will be resolved justly on their merits. Surprise witnesses make good courtroom drama but do not reassure us that justice has been done. To avoid such surprises at trial, discovery aims at laying bare both the parties’ positions and the facts of the case.</p>
<p id="c0cc1275-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In its other guise, discovery aims to put the parties in a position from which they can realistically assess the merits. In an ideal world, such assessments would match (that is, the parties would all accurately predict the results of a trial). When that happens, the parties will often settle. The next chapter explores the dynamics of settlement. When the parties’ assessments of the merits are mismatched, settlement is unlikely, but other mechanisms, like summary judgment, may use the products of discovery to end the case.</p>
<p id="c0cc1276-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Still other parties may be so averse to the litigation process—including discovery—that they try to take themselves outside the adjudicatory system. U.S. law gives them amazing freedom to do so in recognizing a number of contractual alternatives to litigation.</p>
<p id="c0cc1277-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The next chapter explores both the voluntary and involuntary ways in which litigation may be avoided altogether or in which it can end without a trial.</p>

<p id="c0cc60c1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q1.</b> B is the correct response; see Rule 26(d)(1). A is incorrect; although the parties must early on disclose the identity of experts they plan to use (Rule 26(a)(2)), the exchange of reports typically comes quite late in the process (see Rule 26(a)(2)(D)(i)). C and D are wrong because Rule 26(d)(1) forbids depositions or interrogatories before the parties’ planning conference. E is wrong because, although these initial disclosures will be among the first required exchanges of information, they do not come until 14 days <i>after</i> the planning conference (Rule 26(a)(1)(C)).</p>
<p id="c0cc60c2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q2.</b> B, C, D, and E are correct responses. B is correct (and A is incorrect) because at the initial disclosure stage a party need disclose only information <i>supporting</i> her claim or defense. C is correct because such a letter would be information protected by the attorney-client privilege and thus undiscoverable unless the privilege were waived. Note, though, that in response to such a request Barbara would have to comply with Rule 26(b)(5), explaining what the document was and why she was claiming privilege. D is correct because the discovery rules do not prohibit informal information gathering. E is correct because, if we assume the employee has relevant, unprivileged information, he can be deposed.</p>
<p id="c0cc60c3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q3.</b> A is likely the best response. B is wrong because <i>if</i> the other contracts were relevant (doubtful but possible), the fact that their terms would embarrass Barbara would not protect them from discovery. C is wrong because the contracts were drafted in the ordinary course of business, not with litigation in mind. D is wrong because while the contracts may be the product of some confidential communications, only those communications themselves are protected by the privilege—the contracts themselves are not protected.</p>
<p id="c0cc60c4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q4.</b> B is the only correct response. Rule 30(d)(3) permits such a recess, and under the circumstances it seems very likely that the court would issue a protective order. A is wrong because Rule 30(c)(2) provides that for any objection except on grounds of privilege, the question must be answered but the “testimony is taken subject to any objection.” C is wrong because Rule 30(c)(2) provides that a person “may instruct a deponent not to answer <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="522" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page522">p. 522</span>only when necessary to protect a privilege, enforce [a court-ordered limitation on discovery] or to present a motion under Rule 30(d)(3).” D is wrong because what it means to take testimony “subject to any objection” (Rule 30(c)(2)) is precisely that the objection is preserved and may be renewed if Donald tries to use Ethan’s answer in any later stage, say in a motion for summary judgment or during cross-examination at trial; at that point the judge will rule on the objection and exclude the evidence if, as in this case, it is irrelevant.</p>
<p id="c0cc60c5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q5.</b> C and D are the correct responses. A and B are wrong because their provisions apply only to experts “retained in anticipation of litigation.” As a CPA, this witness is certainly an expert, but he was hired to run Barbara’s company finances, not specially to testify in this case. Thus, though an expert, he is not an expert hired in anticipation of litigation and thus not subject to the provisions of Rule 26(b)(4). Therefore no report (so A is wrong) and no immunity from deposition (so B is wrong). C is correct because as a witness in possession of relevant unprivileged information he can be deposed. D is correct because the Rule 26(a)(2)(B) report applies only to experts retained in anticipation of litigation.</p>
<p id="c0cc60c6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q6.</b> C and D are the correct responses. A is wrong because the duty to preserve evidence (enforced through the common law doctrine of spoliation) attaches whenever one is aware (or should be aware) that litigation is reasonably likely. B is wrong because Rule 37(c) states that a court need not sanction a party for failing to disclose a document required by Rule 26(a) if the error is harmless. Here, Barbara has received the document while discovery is still underway and is, therefore, unlikely to be harmed by the earlier failure to disclose. C is correct because Rule 37(d)(3) specifically so provides. D is correct because Barbara needs a specific court order (which is then disobeyed) before one can seek sanctions (Rule 37(a) and (b)).</p>

What they might mean and whether they are right will provide the focus of this chapter. Applied to contemporary U.S. litigation, the quoted statement can refer to the parties’ failure to settle or otherwise resolve their dispute outside the formal litigation processes. Alternatively, it can refer to a failure to resolve the case through procedural mechanisms that are part of the formal litigation process.</p>
<p id="c0d2061a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The last few decades have seen renewed interest in resolving disputes outside the litigation process. Such approaches—including arbitration and mediation—have grown in number and interest in them has intensified. The world of private dispute resolution, which some say is replacing ordinary litigation, presents both the best and worst of human creativity. Those who see promise in these alternative systems contend that arbitration and mediation allow parties to resolve disputes economically and imaginatively: We’ll see some examples in this chapter. Those who see danger in these alternative systems point to evidence of one-sidedness, greed, and disregard for basic fairness, examples of which we will also see in this chapter.</p>
<p id="c0d2061b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some parties do not pursue private dispute resolution and cannot agree on a settlement. What then? A hundred and fifty years ago, the answer was clear: trial. But trials are expensive; even a short trial will cost thousands of dollars in lawyers’, witnesses’, and jurors’ fees, and judicial time—not to mention the time and <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="524" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page524">p. 524</span>emotional toll on the parties. The Federal Rules offer additional opportunities for cases to resolve short of trial in an apparent effort to avoid some of these costs. You have already explored one of these opportunities: Rule 12 motions, which can end a case before the defendant even answers the complaint. In this chapter we consider others, including summary judgment (which allows a court to dismiss a case following discovery).</p>
<p id="c0d2061c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Procedural changes in the last century have accompanied a substantial decline in the frequency of trials. In the last 75 years, the civil trial rate in the federal courts has fallen from about 20 percent to just less than 2 percent. Figures for the state courts, which handle about 98 percent of civil litigation, are comparable. There is a debate about whether those who designed the new procedures intended this reduction in trials and, whether or not they did, if it is a bad thing.</p>
<p id="c0d2061d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We start and end with the official litigation system, venturing outside it after we have established some baselines and some points of connection between the official and the alternative systems.</p>

<p id="c0d22d30-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why do lawsuits ever proceed beyond the complaint? Defendants accused of wrongdoing might just ignore the allegations if there were no way of forcing a response. Conversely, plaintiffs might file meritless suits that would hang over defendants’ heads indefinitely were there not some way of forcing them to a conclusion. Both possibilities are inherent in a system that assigns to the parties rather than the court primary responsibility for the progress of litigation. Two procedural devices force the parties to engage and respond to each other: the default judgment, the threat of which should goad the defendant into action; and the involuntary dismissal, intended to keep the plaintiff from going to sleep at the litigative switch. Versions of such principles are found in Rule 55 (for default judgments) and Rule 41(b) (involuntary dismissal).</p>

<p id="c0d22d33-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How does Rule 55 goad the defendant into action? If a defendant has been properly served with a complaint and then fails to respond, the plaintiff can go to the court clerk with proof of the defendant’s delinquency, and the clerk will enter defendant’s default. Rule 55(a). Then, the plaintiff can submit proof of her injury to the clerk or court and receive a default judgment that she can use to seize defendant’s assets—wages, bank accounts, and real property. Rule 55(c).</p>
<p id="c0d22d34-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most defaults and default judgments involve creditors’ suits over unpaid consumer debts, and the vast majority are not challenged. If a defendant does not have a plausible defense or counterclaim, then the default judgment represents merely a shorter, cheaper route to the right result. If, however, a defendant has a viable defense but cannot find or afford a lawyer, or does not receive adequate notice <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="525" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page525">p. 525</span>of the default, the entry of a default judgment represents a reproach to the legal system.

The judgment was therefore void under Texas law. It was also alleged that the judgment was abstracted and recorded in the county real property records, thereby creating a cloud on appellant’s title, that a writ of attachment was issued, and that, unbeknownst to him, his real property was sold to satisfy the judgment and for much less than its true value. Appellant prayed that the default judgment be vacated, the abstract of judgment be expunged from the county real property records, the constable’s sale be voided, and that judgment for damages be entered against the Medical Center and Mr. and Mrs. Paul Seng-Ngan Chen, the purchasers at the constable’s sale and appellees here.</p>

Although it was assumed for the purposes of summary judgment that there had been defective service and that this lapse excused proof of the second and third requirement for obtaining a bill of review, it was assertedly necessary, nevertheless, to show a meritorious defense, which appellant had conceded he did not have.</p>

But this reasoning is untenable. As appellant asserts, had he had notice of the suit, he might have impleaded the employee whose debt had been guaranteed, worked out a settlement, or paid the debt. He would also have preferred to sell his property himself in order to raise funds rather than to suffer it sold at a constable’s auction.</p>
<p id="c0d25351-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor is there any doubt that the entry of the judgment itself had serious consequences. It is not denied that the judgment was entered on the county records, became a lien on appellant’s property, and was the basis for issuance of a writ of execution under which appellant’s property was promptly sold, without notice. Even if no execution sale had yet occurred, the lien encumbered the property and impaired appellant’s ability to mortgage or alienate it; and state procedures for creating and enforcing such liens are subject to the strictures of due process. Here, we assume that the judgment against him and the ensuing consequences occurred without notice to appellant, notice at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner that would have given him an opportunity to be heard. . . . </p>

By reason of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, that holding is plainly infirm. Where a person has been deprived of property in a manner contrary to the most basic tenets of due process, “it is no answer to say that in his particular case due process of law would have led to the same result because he had no adequate defense upon the merits.” Coe v. Armour Fertilizer Works, 237 U.S. 413, 424 (1915). As we observed in <i>Armstrong v. Manzo</i>, only “wip[ing] the slate clean. . . . would have restored the petitioner to the position he would have occupied had due process of law been accorded to him in the first place.” The Due Process Clause demands no less in this case.</p>

Theoretically, it would be easy to enter a default judgment and let the plaintiff sue his negligent lawyer for malpractice. In practice, courts don’t like that solution—in part because the same lawyers who fail to answer the complaint are unlikely to have bothered to buy malpractice insurance. Or, the problem can lie with the client rather than the lawyer. Consider Honda Power Equip. Mfg., Inc. v. Woodhouse, 219 F.R.D. 2 (D.D.C. 2003). The case arose from a patent dispute between Honda and Mr. Woodhouse, who claimed that some of Honda’s engines infringed his patent. Honda filed a declaratory judgment action, seeking a judgment of non-infringement. Woodhouse hired a lawyer, who acknowledged service of process and requested additional time <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="528" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page528">p. 528</span>to answer. But Woodhouse then failed to respond to his counsel’s inquiries, and an answer was never filed.

If the defendant moves to dismiss the case, he will need to pay his lawyer to research and brief the motion, but could end up having the case dismissed in whole or part if the motion is successful. If the defendant answers the complaint, the answer itself may be relatively inexpensive but the case will proceed to discovery and summary judgment will offer the next likely opportunity for dismissal. Ignoring the complaint is free, but it will likely cause the court to enter a default judgment against him for the value of the plaintiff’s claims.</p>

<p id="c0d2a18d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Involuntary dismissal does to plaintiffs what default does to defendants: It forces them to pursue the lawsuit to some resolution. In our largest state’s court system these dismissals occur in about 5 percent of civil filings. Judicial Council of California, Court Statistics Report (2016), Table 5a, page 93. They sometimes result from plaintiffs realizing that their cases are weaker than previously thought, sometimes from realizing that litigation will be more expensive than thought.</p>
<p id="c0d2a18e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In an ordinary lawsuit, defendant has something that plaintiff wants and can get only if the lawsuit proceeds. One might therefore think that a defendant would be quite happy to face a plaintiff who, after filing and serving the complaint, did nothing. And often defendants are. But consider why a defendant might feel aggrieved if a plaintiff commenced but then did nothing to prosecute the suit for several years. Imagine a variation on the facts in <i>Peralta</i>: The plaintiff files the suit, serves the defendant, and puts a lien on his property, but instead of proceeding to a judgment the plaintiff simply sits and waits. Mr. Peralta can’t get the suit dismissed on the merits (recall he has no meritorious defense), but meanwhile he can’t sell the property or borrow money on it because of the lien.</p>
<p id="c0d2a18f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Add to your picture the role the judge plays in pretrial litigation. You will recall from the preceding chapter on discovery that the event triggering the exchange of disclosures is the “scheduling order.” Much of Rule 16 tells the judge what she “may” do, but Rule 16(b) says the judge ”<i>must</i> issue a scheduling order” (emphasis added) unless the case belongs to an exempt category. That scheduling order “must <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="530" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page530">p. 530</span>limit the time to join other parties, amend the pleadings, complete discovery, and file motions” and “may” set other dates. Scheduling orders are supposed to drive the parties along the path to settlement or trial.</p>
<p id="c0d2a190-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lying behind scheduling orders is a fact that does not often get articulated in judicial opinions: Courts are very busy. In 2016 the federal courts saw about 292,000 civil and 76,000 new criminal cases filed. Congress has authorized 677 district court judgeships. If all those positions were filled, the average federal district judge would have 530 new cases each year for which she was responsible; in practice, there are always a number of unfilled positions, so actual caseloads run higher. Judges in state courts, where most litigation occurs, often have even larger caseloads; in 2008, judges in courts of general jurisdiction (where felonies and large-stake civil litigation occur) had caseloads averaging 2,950 per judge. That national average conceals wide variations, from Massachusetts with about 384 filings per judge to South Carolina, with about 4,842. National Center for State Courts, Examining the Work of State Courts 20 (2008). Such caseloads make for judges who are (a) busy, sometimes to the point of frazzled impatience; and (b) eager to manage their cases in such a way that the backlog does not grow.</p>
<p id="c0d2a191-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What can a defendant do if plaintiff ignores a scheduling order’s deadlines or fails to move the lawsuit forward? Rule 41(b) and similar state statutes provide for involuntary dismissal “if the plaintiff fails to prosecute” (as well as on other grounds). Such a dismissal takes the lawsuit off the books. The question is, how lax must a plaintiff be before a judge should enter such a dismissal? In other words, when does “standard” foot-dragging become abandonment? The answer to these questions will be highly context-specific. Consider, though, Caussade v. United States, 293 F.R.D. 625 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (involuntarily dismissing plaintiff’s claim against the United States for injuries at a post office because the plaintiff never made herself available for a deposition, never made initial disclosures, never corrected deficiencies in her responses to interrogatories, did not appear at a pretrial conference, and did not keep in contact with her attorney for months at a time).</p>

Not quite. Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(i) allows a plaintiff to dismiss any time before the defendant answers, and Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(ii) permits the plaintiff to dismiss a suit at any time if all the parties agree. Why would they agree? Suppose the parties are close to settling and want more time without distractions like discovery in which to negotiate. Such stipulated dismissals do not bar a later refiling of the suit unless there has been a previous dismissal or the dismissal itself contains a provision that bars refiling. Provisions barring refiling frequently result from successful settlement negotiations: In return for money or other relief, the plaintiff gives up her chance to pursue the suit or to refile it later.</p>

The justification for such false starts is much less clear in a system that permits easy joinder of claims and easy amendment.

<li class=""><p id="c0d2c8aa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One possible reason is to give plaintiff a little breathing room to consider changed circumstances.

In one notorious case the availability of voluntary dismissal proved catastrophic for the defendant. In corporate control litigation between two giant oil companies, Texaco and Pennzoil—Texaco Inc. v. Pennzoil, 481 U.S. 1 (1987)—the plaintiff filed originally in a Delaware state court seeking a preliminary injunction. Defendant opposed the injunction but did not answer the complaint. When the court denied the request for a preliminary injunction, using language suggesting the plaintiff would eventually lose on the merits, the plaintiff quickly took a voluntary dismissal and refiled in Texas. A Texas jury eventually awarded the plaintiff $10 billion. Voluntary dismissal without court approval would have been unavailable had Texaco answered the Delaware complaint. The defendant’s failure to answer has been described as “one of the most expensive tactical errors ever committed in a lawsuit.” Timothy Feltham, <i>Tortious Interference with Contractual Relations: The</i> Texaco Inc. v. Pennzoil <i>Litigation</i>, 33 N.Y.L. Sch. L. Rev. 111, 117 n.65 (1988). If a voluntary dismissal will harm your client, answer the complaint promptly to lock plaintiff into the forum.</p></li>

If permission is required, courts routinely require plaintiffs to pay the defendant’s attorneys’ fees as a condition of granting the motion. The logic is fairly clear: Plaintiff chose the time and place of suit and has caused defendant at least the expense of retaining a lawyer and answering the complaint (recall that voluntary dismissals before an answer do not require leave of court). Now plaintiff has changed his mind, but remains free to sue again. Shouldn’t plaintiff have to pay the cost of this vacillation? Should the Rule make this condition explicit?</p>

<p id="c0d2c8b2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since the beginning of recorded legal systems, parties have regularly settled most of their disputes informally, without adjudication. Behind this fact lies a normative question. Settlements are cheaper and faster than trials. Are they also better—or are they merely a capitulation to expediency? Some argue that settlements are not just faster and cheaper but also qualitatively better, because consent is a basic principle of justice, and because settlements can take account of nuances and subtleties in the facts and in the parties’ interests that would be lost in adjudication. On the other side are those who argue that settlement leaves the parties less satisfied than if a trier heard their stories, sometimes permits might to triumph over right, and deprives the public of definitive adjudication of issues that may reach beyond the individual case.</p>
<p id="c0d2c8b3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where one falls on this normative question may depend on the case and the reasons it settled. One reason for settlement is unattractive: What if a party simply runs out of funds to pursue the litigation? A settlement, getting something, may be better than getting nothing (which is what will happen if the case is dismissed) or being stuck with a default judgment (if the defendant is the side unable to pursue the case). How often does this happen? There’s evidence that cases collapsing without regard to the merits is a much rarer event than it used to be. As the materials in Chapter 5 suggest, modern litigation finance is relatively <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="533" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page533">p. 533</span>creative, and the plaintiffs’ bar better capitalized; therefore the stock story of the meritorious plaintiff crushed by defendant’s vastly superior resources is less true today than it once was. Different dynamics apply to defendants. Defendants who cannot pay a judgment will rarely be sued for damages (hold-over tenants and divorce litigation are significant exceptions here), so when defendants abandon litigation, it will usually be because circumstances have changed since the case began.</p>
<p id="c0d2c8b4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That leaves a second, more common and thus more important, reason for settling. Settlements control risk. Trial outcomes have two characteristics that make them risky: (1) They are significantly unpredictable, and (2) they tend to be all-or-nothing. Even experienced lawyers have a hard time predicting how juries will decide a given case—keep in mind that summary judgment (infra page 569) will eliminate the clear cases, so the only cases that make it to trial should be those where the evidence doesn’t point clearly in one direction. Substantive law tells judge and jury not to split the difference, but either to hold the defendant liable for all proximately caused damages or to find for the defense. Consequently, trial can result in either a catastrophe or a windfall for both parties, and no one knows for certain which will happen. Exacerbating these risks is the fact that trial is expensive. Not only is lawyers’ time in trial expensive, but expert witnesses have to be paid, exhibits prepared, and witnesses’ memories refreshed (in most jurisdictions a trial will come at least a year after suit is filed, which may be several years after the events in question). Moreover, in spite of judicial efforts to have parties complete discovery well before trial, in many cases the approach of trial will set off a flurry of additional discovery as lawyers scurry to shore up weak points in their cases. Parties will also submit various pretrial motions to exclude evidence and the like, running expenses even higher. So, for many parties, settlement is appealing because it provides a way of avoiding an expensive and risky trial.</p>
<p id="c0d2c8b5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If they are to achieve their goals, whether of risk avoidance or of consensual justice, settlements have to be technically competent. Settlement agreements require both negotiating skill and knowledge of how parties can achieve their goals once they come to agreement in principle. Unlike parties who are negotiating the sale of a building or the terms of an employment agreement, parties who are negotiating in the shadow of litigation and trial are likely to be somewhat annoyed with each other. Lawyers can contribute to negotiations by interposing a professional role that keeps the disputants from each others’ throats long enough to work out an agreement. Or they can make things worse by becoming so personally embroiled with their counterparts that they prevent two clients, who might otherwise have agreed, from doing so! Whether they help or hinder agreement, however, lawyers can contribute expertise to the terms and the form of settlement, anticipating problems and preventing the settlement of one dispute from becoming the start of another.</p>

Litigation involves one set of such risks: What might be the outcome of this suit? Settlement controls risk. A plaintiff accepting a defendant’s settlement offer eliminates the risk of recovering nothing by giving up the possibility of a recovery at trial greater than the settlement amount. For the defendant the risks are reversed: By giving up the possibility of a defense judgment, defendant controls the risk of a verdict greater than the amount paid in settlement.</p></li>
<li><p id="c0d2c8bb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Clients seek lawyers to bring skilled and experienced judgment to bear. They will ask you not just “what is the law here?” but also “what’s the likely outcome of this case?” They are, in effect, asking for your estimates of risk. That second question is very difficult to answer (and some data suggest that even experienced lawyers are not very accurate in making those estimates). But clients will expect answers, and part of a lawyer’s job is to understand the ways in which their client may rank different kinds of risk.</p></li>

<p id="c0d2efce-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Jane Smart is a plant geneticist. Until recently she worked at GrowCo, a relatively new, profitable, and expanding firm specializing in genetically modified crops. GrowCo has been much in the news recently, with favorable press reports and significant investor interest. Smart has been deeply involved in developing some of GrowCo’s most successful crops. A dispute with the Senior Scientist, whom Smart accuses of sexual harassment, leads to her dismissal. Dr. Smart consults a lawyer and threatens to bring an action for unlawful discharge and employment discrimination, invoking state law and Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act. As the lawyers for both sides speak with their clients, the facts aren’t one-sided. Plaintiff’s story suggests that Senior Scientist has behaved in ways that are at least obnoxious (and will sound terrible to a jury) and are perhaps unlawful. But plaintiff’s story also has some problems. It’s not clear that she was an excellent employee before her dismissal, and her past involves some breaches of scientific ethics in testing genetically modified crops on humans that will make it easy for defendant to challenge her testimony and portray her as an untrustworthy person.</p>

The financial effects of settlements on lawyers will depend on their fee arrangements with their clients. Imagine that Smart’s lawyer is working on a contingent fee arrangement such that she will receive one-third of any settlement but nothing if Smart loses, modified by the possibility that a prevailing plaintiff in a Title VII suit can collect reasonable attorneys’ fees from the losing defendant. (See Chapter 5, supra.) Imagine GrowCo is paying its lawyer by the hour.</p>

GrowCo’s attorney will be paid his hourly rate for the relatively few hours of work needed to settle the case.</p></li>

At this point, if Smart accepts the settlement offer, Smart’s attorney will earn $40,000 for $50,000 of work. If <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="536" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page536">p. 536</span>Smart rejects the offer, goes to trial, and wins, Smart’s attorney will be able to recover her reasonable attorneys’ fees—presumably $50,000 plus the cost of her services through trial. If Smart rejects the offer, goes to trial, and loses, Smart’s attorney will recover nothing. GrowCo’s attorney, in contrast, will be paid for his hourly work regardless of whether his client settles or wins or loses at trial.</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0d2efde-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose, as often happens, that the parties reach a settlement before suit is filed.

<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0d2efdf-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Regardless of how they reach agreement, the parties generally do not need the court’s approval of their deal. In an ordinary case, the judge need not examine or approve the settlement, though he must grant—usually routinely—plaintiff’s request to dismiss the case if that is part of the deal. Plaintiffs needing immediate funds may settle meritorious claims for trivial sums; defendants eager to get on with other matters may offer substantial sums on meritless claims to end litigation. The principal exceptions to this “freedom to settle” arise in class actions (where Rule 23(e) requires judicial approval of settlements); in cases involving minors or incompetent adults, where the court is required to approve settlements; and in some multi-defendant cases. What theory underlies these exceptions to the general rule of judicial indifference to the fairness of settlements?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d316f0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is the usual practice of judicial indifference defensible? Should judges be required to scrutinize all settlements for fairness? Before answering, imagine yourself as judge. Suppose a very common case—a rear-end vehicle collision in which plaintiff alleges soft-tissue injuries. Such injuries are common, but also commonly feigned. Defendant, represented by an insurer, has denied liability but has offered a small settlement. You, the judge, are asked to approve or reject the settlement. How would you reach a decision? What information would you want to have? Would your concern be substantive (is the settlement fair?) or procedural (did both parties know the material facts?)? Would the cost of gathering and presenting this information eliminate two of the chief advantages of settlement—speed and efficiency—and place additional burdens on the courts?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d316f1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a half-way step between trying to police all settlements and leaving matters entirely to the law of contract, legislators could build procedural protections into settlements of certain kinds of claims. For example, federal legislation regulates settlements releasing Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) claims: Offers must be clearly written; they must remain in effect for stated periods of time; the employer must advise employees to consult a lawyer; and they must give settling employees at least a week to revoke a signed settlement agreement. 29 U.S.C. §626(f). In Oubre v. Entergy Operations, Inc., 522 U.S. 422 (1998), the Court held that an employee who had released ADEA claims without these procedures could, without tendering back the money paid for a settlement, bring suit under the Act.</p></li>

A good deal of it will depend on the merits of the case: How “good” or “bad” are the facts? How sympathetic and credible will the plaintiff and her supervisor be as witnesses?

<li class=""><p id="c0d316f5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After discussion, your client gives you a dollar figure GrowCo is willing to offer the plaintiff to settle. You contact Smart’s lawyer (ethical rules prohibit a lawyer’s directly contacting a represented client), discuss a series of depositions you want to take, and, at the end of the conversation, ask whether there’s any point in discussing settlement. The plaintiff’s attorney says it might be possible, and after some haggling you reach a figure that the plaintiff’s counsel is willing to recommend to her client.

In some respects this is the simplest and best form of settlement: By definition it eliminates all litigation costs. But this form of agreement also requires the lawyer to carefully define the scope of the threatened lawsuit. The putative plaintiff must agree not to sue on the same claims in the future, but because there has been no complaint filed, it can be challenging to define the scope of the release.</p>

But recall that Rule 41(a) permits a plaintiff taking a voluntary dismissal to refile the suit—just the result that a settlement seeks to avoid. Accordingly, defense counsel will require the plaintiff to agree, as part of the terms of the settlement agreement, not to refile this or any related lawsuit. If the plaintiff later refiles her suit, defendant can sue for breach of the settlement agreement.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0d33e0f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An additional way to ensure that the plaintiff cannot refile her claim is to have the dismissal treated as a judgment on the merits (otherwise known as a dismissal with prejudice). As you will see in Chapter 11, under modern doctrines of former adjudication, a claim adjudicated on the merits is interpreted to bar all related claims, whether or not they were stated in the complaint. Such a mode of dismissal also means that if the plaintiff files a second lawsuit, the defendant can invoke not just the contract of settlement but the doctrines of former adjudication to have the suit dismissed. Rule 41(a) voluntary dismissals are treated as dismissals without prejudice “[u]nless the notice or stipulation states otherwise.” Accordingly, a savvy defense attorney will ensure that a notice of voluntary dismissal asks the court to dismiss the case “with prejudice.”</p></li>

<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcroman">
<li class=""><p id="c0d33e11-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The usual answer is that the party seeking to enforce the settlement must sue for breach of contract, the contract in question being the settlement agreement. That suit must take its place at the back of the line of pending litigation: It gets no special attention by virtue of being a suit to enforce a settlement. Indeed, in federal court it may suffer a disadvantage. Jane Smart’s original suit, for employment discrimination, could invoke federal question jurisdiction. But the suit to enforce the settlement contract does not arise under federal law, so the employee can invoke federal jurisdiction only if there is diversity between her and her employer and the amount in controversy is satisfied—probably not the case if only a continuation of medical benefits are at stake. See Langley v. Jackson State University, 14 F.3d 1070 (5th Cir. 1994) (no federal jurisdiction to enforce settlement of federal civil rights claims).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d33e12-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If one anticipates that problem, there is a solution. Suppose the obligation to pay medical benefits had been embodied in a judgment—usually called a “consent decree,” decree because it is a court order; consent because it embodies the parties’ consented-to settlement—in those circumstances either party can invoke the court’s jurisdiction to enforce its own judgments. The order of dismissal can also include a provision whereby the court “retains jurisdiction” over disputes concerning the terms of the settlement agreement.</p></li>

Why would a defendant do that? Consider the facts surrounding the wreck of the Exxon <i>Valdez</i>, an oil supertanker that ran aground in Alaskan waters, polluting miles of shoreline and ocean. The captain of the vessel was shown to be drunk in his cabin during the critical time when course should have been changed through the tricky channel; worse, there was evidence suggesting that the defendant knew of the captain’s alcoholism but continued to employ him. Why might Exxon want to have a jury consider only the amount of damages and not the circumstances leading to the accident?</p></li>

<div class="epub-heading  left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0d3652b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">b.&nbsp;<i>Third-Party Participation in Settlement: Facilitation, Encouragement, and Coercion</i></p></div>
<p id="c0d3652c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Settlement negotiations sometimes fail. Broadly speaking, one can trace the failure of negotiations to two causes: divergent estimates of the case’s value and bad communication. In <i>Smart v. GrowCo</i>, perhaps either Smart or her lawyer misjudges the likely reaction of a jury to her story and therefore rejects GrowCo’s offer. Or GrowCo’s general counsel makes no offer, perhaps because he is determined to show the board of directors that he is a strong executive, or to accede to the demands of Senior Scientist who threatens otherwise to quit. Alternatively, the parties may have similar guesses about the outcome of litigation but may not be communicating clearly, perhaps because the parties or their lawyers have taken a dislike to one another. Any of these circumstances can lead to the collapse of negotiations.</p>
<p id="c0d3652d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sometimes, however, negotiations that would otherwise fail can succeed if the parties have help. Help comes in several forms, depending on the nature of the problem and the source of help. If the problem is communication, someone who can facilitate those communications may be able to help. Generically, such facilitators are called mediators. What does a mediator do? One vision of “mediation” is as assisted negotiation, an aid in overcoming barriers to agreement.</p>
<p id="c0d3652e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another way to describe a mediator’s role is to frame it entirely in terms of process: The mediator seeks to engage the parties in a structured set of discussions leading to agreement. Because the goal is an agreement of the parties, the mediator <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="541" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page541">p. 541</span>does not rule on the rights and wrongs of the dispute or tell the parties what to do. The mediator’s limited role is a function of the fact that she has no coercive power: The mediator succeeds only if the parties agree. A mediator typically talks with the parties (sometimes together, sometimes individually, sometimes both), to ferret out areas of agreement and possible starting points for negotiation, to discover the respective parties’ goals, and to suggest ways to accommodate these goals. The success of mediation depends partly on the level of trust the mediator is able to establish and partly on the distance separating the parties’ goals.</p>
<p id="c0d3652f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In recent decades, a cadre of professional mediators—many with legal training—has emerged, who offer their services to parties for a fee. Courts and legislatures have shown significant interest in the power of mediation to achieve settlements, and in some cases have established what sounds like a contradiction: mandatory mediation. Some states require cases to be submitted to mediation before they will set a trial date. In federal law the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 1998, 28 U.S.C. §§651 et seq., requires each federal district court to “authorize[],. . . . devise, and implement its own alternative dispute resolution program.” 28 U.S.C. §651(b). The statute’s goal becomes clear from a section instructing district courts to adopt a local rule that “require[s] litigants in all civil cases to consider the use of an alternative dispute resolution process at an appropriate state in the litigation” and to “provide litigants in all civil cases with at least one alternative dispute resolution proces. . . . ” The statute goes on to require training of “neutrals” to help the parties come to agreement.</p>
<p id="c0d36530-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Family law—divorce, support, and custody disputes—has been a frequent target for these efforts. In one view, the popularity of mediation in this context reflects the fact that some family conflicts by their nature are ideal for mediation; in another view, it is said to reflect the low importance attached to these cases by some judges and lawyers. Bear in mind, too, that some efforts described as mediation would be more accurately described as settlements arrived at under heavy pressure, in which the mediator threatens to report to the judge that one or another party is behaving unreasonably (sometimes called “muscle mediation,” and which is prohibited by some court rules and statutes).</p>

<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0d36534-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To begin work, what would the mediator want to know from the parties?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d36535-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some mediators might proceed by asking the parties how much (or how little) they would accept to settle the claim. Such mediation is sometimes called “positional” and treats settlement as a pie to be divided, in which anything gained by one party is lost by the other. Such mediators can be useful if the parties have engaged in significant bluffing, failing to disclose their true settlement positions.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d36536-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="542" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page542">p. 542</span>Other mediators will proceed by trying to discover the parties’ goals, defining these less in monetary than in other terms. This approach is sometimes called “interest-based” mediation. Suppose, for example, the mediator learns from Jane Smart that she is primarily interested in coming away from this dispute with a clean reference that will enable her to find another job and the dignity of not having been fired for cause. GrowCo, on the other hand, wants to be able to recruit future plant botanists and to continue to attract the interest of investors. Can you think of settlement agreements that would achieve both goals?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d38c47-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How should a lawyer conduct herself in mediation? Some approach it like a case—presenting facts and arguments. Many mediators, particularly those employing interest-based mediation (see Note 1c above) resist this, asking lawyers and parties to focus on goals and desired outcomes, not facts and rights.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d38c48-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the course of mediation a party or lawyer makes a statement of fact. If the mediation fails, can the other side later introduce the statement in evidence? Probably not. Mediation agreements and evidentiary rules typically protect such statements from disclosure.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d38c49-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How and when should a judge assigned to a case act as a mediator?</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0d38c4a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One might take the view that they never should—that judges should be adjudicators, and should leave any settlement to the parties or to figures like court-appointed mediators.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d38c4b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whatever the merits of such a view, current procedural law does not support it. Two bodies of law allow a judge to actively manage litigation, personally and through delegates. Rule 16(a)(5) establishes “facilitating settlement” as one of the goals of pretrial conferences. Rule 16(c) contains a shopping list of management techniques ranging from establishing time limits to encouraging settlement. The Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 1998, 28 U.S.C. §§651 et seq., requires federal judicial districts to offer the parties, even after they have filed a suit, alternatives to litigation, such as mediation or nonbinding arbitration (described below).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d38c4c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Act references “early neutral evaluation” as one possible approach. 28 U.S.C. §651(a). Early neutral evaluation embodies a simple idea: Parties tend to have excessively optimistic evaluations of their cases; presenting one’s case briefly to a neutral party who assesses its strengths and weaknesses will lead to a more realistic negotiating position. Such evaluators are typically volunteer lawyers or magistrate judges not otherwise involved in the case. By listening to the parties’ presentations, they offer each a reality check, enabling each party to see its own case’s weaknesses and its adversary’s strengths. Notice that with neutral evaluation we are moving away from the world of mediation and toward a sneak preview of litigation.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d38c4d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another variation is the “summary jury trial” as a settlement device. Summary jury trials are not real trials at all. Instead, lawyers present their cases to a mock “jury” in very abbreviated form (usually narrating what the evidence will show rather than calling actual witnesses). The “jury” is <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="543" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page543">p. 543</span>charged, deliberates, and returns its verdict, which, however, is not binding. Instead, the verdict serves as a reality check: The plaintiff who thought his case was worth $250,000 discovers the “jury” was willing to award only $50,000; the defendant who thought she would win a defense verdict finds herself stung by significant damages. The hope underlying all these processes is that actually “losing” a low-cost version of the case (or winning less than was hoped for) may cause the parties to settle.</p></li>

<p id="c0d38c50-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants and plaintiffs sometimes share the goal that any settlement be confidential. Consider again our hypothetical case, <i>Smart v. GrowCo</i>. Suppose that Smart files her unlawful discharge action, and GrowCo counterclaims for an injunction forbidding Smart from disclosing any trade secrets. As in many such cases, discovery yields information that makes both sides unhappy. Depositions suggest that Senior Scientist has exhibited behavior toward a number of women that may look quite bad to a jury and that might make it hard to recruit future plant geneticists. Depositions and documents also suggest that Smart, in addition to great talent and skill in plant genetics, has unorthodox work habits and a very free hand with expense accounts that may not endear her to future employers. In addition, there is the matter of the disputed patents and trade secrets. In such a case, both parties might desire some measure of confidentiality concerning both the information unearthed during discovery and the ultimate resolution of the case.</p>
<p id="c0d38c51-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most commonly, confidentiality agreements seek to bar specific information or documents from public exposure. Can the parties do this—and with what limits?</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0d3b365-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A confidentiality agreement could certainly add value for Jane Smart. Smart would probably like not to publicize the fact that she sued her former employer, for fear that it would cause some prospective employer not to hire her. Although the fact that she filed a suit will always be a matter of public record, a confidentiality agreement can prevent GrowCo from revealing it. Absent such a revelation, only a diligent employer who searched court records would learn about the suit. Return of the documents and records might also prevent others from learning the facts revealed by discovery—such as Smart’s unorthodox work habits and expense account use. Discovery requests and responses and depositions are not filed with the court unless included as part of a motion. See Rule 5(d)(1). Therefore, a persistent and diligent employer who searches court records could only learn such facts if they were included in a motion filed with the court.</p></li>

The company would be concerned about maintaining confidentiality of any non-patented trade secrets (patents themselves are public records but there are often related unpatented processes). GrowCo would also want to prevent others from learning about certain facts revealed by discovery, such as the sexist behavior of Senior Scientist. Finally, GrowCo wants to discourage other terminated employees from filing suit, and therefore has an interest in maintaining confidential the amount of money it paid to settle Smart’s claims.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d3b367-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notice, however, that on these facts, protecting Smart’s and GrowCo’s interests may impose burdens on others. Suppose there is a group of scientists working for GrowCo who have been subjected to similar behavior by Senior Scientist. They have not brought suit in part because they suspect that no one will believe them. If they knew that Smart had successfully asserted such a claim, they might be emboldened to assert similar claims. How should the law deal with such “collateral damage” from confidential settlements?</p></li>

<p id="c0d3da8b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In general, the scope of discovery is very broad. “Parties may obtain discovery regarding <i>any</i> [<i>unprivileged matter that is relevant to any party’s claim or defense</i>”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1046D_d543d88d-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N1046D_d543d88d-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">3</a></span> Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1) (emphasis added). The primary goal of the court and discovery is “to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.</p>
<p id="c0d4019d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The public interest favors judicial policies which promote the completion of litigation. Public interest also seeks to protect the finality of prior suits and the secrecy of settlements when desired by the settling parties. However, the courts also serve society by providing a public forum for issues of general concern. The case at bar presents a direct conflict between these crucial public and private interests.</p>
<p id="c0d4019e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To allow full discovery into all aspects of Ms. Thomas’s case could discourage similar settlements. Confidential settlements benefit society and the parties involved by resolving disputes relatively quickly, with slight judicial intervention, and presumably result in greater satisfaction to the parties. Sound judicial policy fosters and protects this form of alternative dispute resolution. See, e.g., Fed. R. Evid. 408 which protects compromises and offers to compromise by rendering them inadmissible to prove liability. The secrecy of a settlement agreement and the contractual rights of the parties thereunder deserve court protection.</p>
<p id="c0d4019f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="547" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page547">p. 547</span>On the other hand, to prevent any discovery into Ms. Thomas’s case based upon the settlement agreement results in disturbing consequences. First, as pointed out by Kalinauskas, preventing the deposition of Ms. Thomas would condone the practice of “buy[ing] the silence of a witness with a settlement agreement.” This court harbors little doubt that preventing the dissemination of the underlying facts which prompted Ms. Thomas to file suit is in Caesars’s interest, and formed an important part of the agreement to Caesars. Caesars avers that without the confidentiality order the <i>Thomas</i> case would not have settled. Yet despite this freedom to contract, the courts must carefully police the circumstances under which litigants seek to protect their interests while concealing legitimate areas of public concern. This concern grows more pressing as additional individuals are harmed by identical or similar action.</p>
<p id="c0d401a0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the deposition of Ms. Thomas is likely to lead to relevant evidence. Preventing the deposition of Ms. Thomas or the discovery of documents created in her case could lead to wasteful efforts to generate discovery already in existence. . . . </p>
<p id="c0d401a1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Caesars[’s] motion for a protective order preventing the deposition of Ms. Thomas rests entirely upon the confidential settlement agreement. Caesars. . . . maintains that it should be able to rely upon the confidentiality order to protect against [disclosure to] third parties, unless extraordinary circumstances or compelling need justifies some breach of secrecy. . . . </p>
<p id="c0d401a2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Caesars’s] argument that Kalinauskas must show a compelling need to obtain discovery applies to discovery of the specific terms of the settlement agreement (i.e., the amount and conditions of the agreement), not [to] factual information surrounding Thomas’s case. Caesars should not be able to conceal basic facts of concern to Kalinauskas in her case, and of legitimate public concern, regarding employment at its place of business.</p>
<p id="c0d401a3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, keeping in mind the liberal nature of discovery, this court will allow the deposition of Ms. Thomas. . . . The deposition of Ms. Thomas and any further discovery into the Thomas case must not, however, disclose any substantive terms of the Caesars-Thomas settlement agreement. Naturally, Ms. Thomas may answer questions regarding her employment at Caesars and any knowledge of sexual harassment.</p>
<p id="c0d401a4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the terms of the confidential settlement agreement impose penalties upon Ms. Thomas for discussing her past employment at Caesars, those penalties shall not apply to the disclosure of information for discovery purposes in furtherance of Kalinauskas’s case. Indeed, the settlement agreement itself makes exception for court ordered release of information.</p>
<p id="c0d401a5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While settlement is an important objective, an overzealous quest for alternative dispute resolution can distort the proper role of the court. Furthermore, settlement agreements which suppress evidence violate the greater public policy. . . . </p>
<p id="c0d401a6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Based on the foregoing. . . . IT IS HEREBY ORDERED. . . . that the Defendant’s Motion for Protective Order is granted to the extent that during the deposition of Ms. Donna R. Thomas, no information regarding the settlement agreement itself shall come forth [and] that the Defendant’s Motion for Protective Order is denied as to all other requests. . . . </p>

<p id="c0d44fda-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Understanding cases like <i>Kalinauskas</i> opens the door to understanding the larger debate about confidentiality agreements. Why do defendants want them? What do they hope to get from them? And are they good or bad as a matter of public policy?</p>
<p id="c0d44fdb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We now know from <i>Kalinauskas</i> and cases like it that a confidentiality agreement or a sealed record cannot “buy silence”: Witnesses with relevant information about the underlying facts of a case can testify about those facts regardless of confidentiality agreements. An agreement that tried to forbid such testimony would almost certainly be struck down as a violation of public policy.</p>
<p id="c0d44fdc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Caesars might still stand to gain a great deal through a confidentiality agreement, though. Suppose there are several prospective plaintiffs allegedly harmed by the same actions of defendant—for example, if the same supervisor at Caesars Palace had harassed several other employees. By barring Ms. Thomas from talking about her settlement, Caesars might hope that the settlement might not encourage similarly situated employees to sue. But ordinary workplace gossip occurring well before the confidentiality agreement would likely alert others that Ms. Thomas had sued—indeed her lawyer might well ask her to spread the word in order to elicit others’ stories of harassment.</p>
<p id="c0d44fdd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Caesars might also believe that the confidentiality agreement would make it more difficult for other plaintiffs to benefit from the <i>Thomas</i> litigation. Suppose there was no confidentiality agreement or sealed record in <i>Thomas</i>. A new plaintiff with a similar claim might simply call Ms. Thomas’s lawyer and request the discovery exchanged in her case to save the cost and trouble of doing her own investigation and discovery. The confidentiality agreement requires future plaintiffs to absorb the full costs of investigation and discovery.</p>
<p id="c0d44fde-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs’ lawyers are of two minds about confidentiality agreements. In any given case, accepting a confidentiality agreement may be the key to settlement, or may result in the client getting more money, sometimes referred to as a “confidentiality premium.” On the other hand, confidentiality agreements and sealed discovery may delay public knowledge of dangerous or unlawful situations, or repeated bad behavior by the same defendant. Suppose a defendant repeatedly dumps toxic chemicals into a residential area, or engages in serial harassment. Even if some plaintiffs come forward, settlements requiring confidentiality and sealed discovery prevent the knowledge about these harms from spreading quickly. Arguably, courts should not be in the business of abetting such concealment. Moreover, if discovery in prior cases is available, it will reduce the expense of subsequent, similar lawsuits—a desirable outcome if such suits will force a defendant to change unlawful practices. Some states have captured this idea in legislation; in Washington, a <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="550" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page550">p. 550</span>statute declares that the public has a right to information from products liability or hazardous substance cases “necessary for a lay member of the public to understand the nature, source, and extent of the risk from alleged hazards” and requires a court considering a protective order to weigh that public interest. Wash. Rev. Code Ann. §4.24.611(1)(c)(2). Should a statute similarly mandate transparency in sexual harassment cases?</p>

<p id="c0d476f3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Parties can enter into contracts to settle lawsuits, and they can employ mediators to help them reach such settlements. But what if the parties cannot agree, even with the help of a mediator, or can agree only that they want to have their disputes decided by a third party. Is their only choice to resort to the courts? No. Arbitration is one of the oldest and best-established alternatives to litigating in court. Unlike a mediator, an arbitrator decides a dispute after having heard from both sides. Arbitration, in other words, closely resembles adjudication—private, nonjudicial adjudication, but still adjudication.</p>
<p id="c0d476f4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why, if it is so much like adjudication, do the parties not simply proceed through the court system? Sometimes the reasons are purely practical; for example, the parties may be able to arrange hearing dates and locations that are more convenient for counsel and witnesses. But arbitration can have more fundamental differences—differences that, depending on the case, may advantage one party and disadvantage the other:</p>
<ul class="">
<li><p id="c0d476f5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unlike court adjudication, binding arbitration results in an award that is essentially final and not subject to further challenge, with very limited exceptions, such as proof that the arbitrator was corrupt or the agreement to arbitrate was unconscionable. The absence of appeal prevents the case from dragging on, but may also protect from reversal an arbitrary, unfair result.</p></li>
<li><p id="c0d476f6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Parties can choose the arbitrator. The choice may simply be someone who has a reputation for being fair and reasonable. Or, the parties may arrange that the arbitrator will be someone who is experienced in the subject matter of the dispute (be it medical malpractice, engineering, or securities) in the expectation that this will produce a fairer result than could be obtained before even a highly qualified, but generalist, judge or a lay jury. Again, this might be viewed as a disadvantage to a party whose case contravenes conventional wisdom in that subject area, or a party whose case is long on emotion but short on the facts and the law.</p></li>
<li><p id="c0d476f7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Arbitration permits the parties to determine what substantive rules apply—they can insist, for example, that the arbitrator will not refer to the ordinary rules of contract but instead will adhere to the traditions that have developed <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="551" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page551">p. 551</span>around this particular commercial relationship. As a result, the arbitrator, though deciding the dispute, may decide it more “softly” than a court:</p>

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0d476f8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is said of the American commercial arbitrator that he may “do justice as he sees it, applying his own sense of the law and equity to the facts as he finds them to be and making an award reflecting the spirit rather than the letter of the agreement.” Many awards resulting from such proceedings might also be described as Solomonic, halving the objects in dispute.</p>

</li>

<li><p id="c0d476fa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Parties can also dictate which procedural rules apply in the arbitration. Sometimes that results in processes that are scarcely distinguishable from judicial adjudication—full discovery followed by a hearing that looks very much like a trial. In other cases, the parties may agree to depart dramatically from legal process (<i>Ferguson v. Writer’s Guild of America, West</i>, infra page 567, is an example). As you will see in <i>Epic Systems</i>, infra page 559, a current issue in arbitration agreements is the extent to which the parties may contract out of class actions and class arbitrations.</p></li>
<li><p id="c0d476fb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Arbitration <i>can</i> be less expensive than adjudication. The parties can take several steps that may make the process cheaper: dispensing with, or substantially curtailing, the rules of discovery; agreeing that most (or all) witnesses can testify by affidavit rather than in person; truncating the hearing through agreed-upon time limits. The one service that is usually more expensive in arbitration is the time of the arbitrator. Taxpayers pay the salaries of judges; the construction and upkeep of the courthouse are also expenses largely borne by taxpayers. Arbitrators, in contrast, charge by the hour—often at rates in excess of those charged by attorneys. And one common form of arbitration uses three arbitrators (one chosen by each party, with the third chosen by the first two); in such a case each day of arbitration can cost $10,000—just for the arbitrators.</p></li>
<li><p id="c0d476fc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Arbitration is more confidential than ordinary adjudication. The public, including the press, normally have the right to attend judicial proceedings. Unless protected by judicial order, documents filed in court and transcripts of judicial proceedings are normally public records. In contrast, arbitration hearings are normally not open to the public, and the parties can even agree that the outcome of the arbitration be kept private.</p></li>
<li><p id="c0d476fd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Arbitration may avoid the vagaries in outcome that a jury may introduce, although one has to be careful here: If a jury acts in a lawless way, its verdict is subject to reversal, while arbitration “awards” are not subject to judicial review except for the most extreme reasons.</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="c0d49e0e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Agreements to arbitrate can occur at several points in a dispute. Sometimes they come after the parties have already begun litigation. A post-dispute agreement to arbitrate is uncontroversially enforceable—a party cannot commence arbitration and then back out.</p>
<p id="c0d49e0f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="552" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page552">p. 552</span>But arbitration agreements often come long before any dispute, much less a lawsuit, has arisen. In recent years, an increasing number of organizations have included arbitration provisions in their contracts for a wide range of products and services: employment, credit cards, cell phones, medical care, financial services, and software—to name just a few. Judicial attitudes toward enforcement of pre-dispute arbitration agreements have undergone a swing historically, and the pendulum appears still to be moving. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, some courts refused to enforce pre-dispute arbitration agreements under any circumstances. By case law and statute, however, the rule has generally been changed in favor of their enforcement. For example, the U.S. Supreme Court, which once viewed with suspicion the arbitration of claims arising under federal statutes, has enforced agreements to arbitrate many kinds of statutory claims—for example, antitrust claims, securities law claims and, most recently, employment discrimination claims—so long as the arbitration procedure does not effectively prevent the claimant from vindicating her statutory rights.</p>
<p id="c0d49e10-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some of these arbitration agreements arise in situations where one party essentially dictates the terms of the contract (including the terms of the arbitration agreement) to the other party on a “take-it-or-leave-it” basis. The employer, for example, makes acceptance of an employer-drafted arbitration agreement a condition of employment. In recent years, courts have looked more closely at the fairness of the arbitration process before enforcing an arbitration agreement in such contexts.</p>

<p id="c0d49e13-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To understand the framework for courts’ scrutiny of arbitration agreements, one has to understand the relation of state and federal law in this area: Very roughly speaking, federal law declares the general enforceability of agreements to arbitrate, but allows state law to set some limits on those agreements. Inside those boundaries, states are allowed to regulate arbitration, but if they step over those boundaries, federal law displaces (“preempts” in lawyer-talk) that of the states.</p>
<p id="c0d49e14-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. §§2 et seq., enacted in 1925 to counter judicial hostility to pre-dispute arbitration agreements, has three basic sections.</p>
<ul class="">

It creates a body of federal substantive law establishing and regulating the duty to honor an agreement to arbitrate, yet it does not create any independent federal-question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §1331 or otherwise. Section 4 provides for an order compelling arbitration only when the federal district court would have jurisdiction over a suit on the underlying dispute; hence, there must be diversity of citizenship or some other independent basis for federal jurisdiction before the order can issue. Section 3 likewise limits the federal courts to the extent that a federal court cannot stay a suit pending before it unless there is such a suit in existence. Nevertheless, although enforcement of the Act is left in large part to the state courts, it nevertheless represents federal policy to be vindicated by the federal courts where otherwise appropriate.</p>

As a result, some claims that once would have been triable to a jury and subject to appellate review have become subject to arbitration.</p>

The portion of general contracts doctrine most frequently deployed to challenge arbitration clauses is unconscionability. Indeed, some claim that recent unconscionability decisions around the country arise almost entirely from arbitration contexts. Consider just one example, where a federal court applied a state’s law of unconscionability to strike down an arbitration agreement.</p>

In order to render a contract unenforceable under the doctrine of unconscionability, there must be both a procedural and substantive element of unconscionability. These two elements, however, need not both be present in the same degree. Thus, for example, the more substantively oppressive the contract term, the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable.</p>

A determination of whether a contract is procedurally unconscionable focuses on two factors: oppression and surprise. Oppression arises from an inequality of bargaining power which results in no real negotiation and an absence of meaningful choice. Surprise involves the extent to which the supposedly agreed-upon terms of the bargain are hidden in the prolix printed form drafted by the party seeking to enforce the disputed terms.</p>

We found the agreement to be procedurally unconscionable because Circuit City, which possesses considerably more bargaining power than nearly all of its employees or applicants, drafted the contract and uses it as its standard arbitration agreement for all of its new employees. The agreement is a prerequisite to employment, and job applicants are not permitted to modify the agreement’s terms—they must take the contract or leave it.</p>

The discovery provision states that “a deposition of a corporate representative shall be limited to no more than four designated subjects,” but does not impose a similar limitation on depositions of employees. Ferguson also notes that the arbitration agreement sets mutual limitations (e.g., no more than three depositions) and mutual advantages (e.g., unlimited expert witnesses) which favor Countrywide because it is in a superior position to gather information regarding its business practices and employees’ conduct, and has greater access to funds to pay for expensive expert witnesses.</p>
<p id="c0d5126d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ferguson urges this court to affirm the district court’s ruling that the discovery provision is unconscionable on the ground that the limitations and mutual advantages on discovery are unfairly one-sided and have no commercial justification other than “maximizing employer advantage,” which is an improper basis for such differences under <i>Armendariz</i>. Countrywide argues to the contrary that the arbitration agreement provides for ample discovery by employees.</p>
<p id="c0d5126e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Armendariz</i>, the California Supreme Court held that employees are “at least entitled to discovery sufficient to adequately arbitrate their statutory claims, including access to essential documents and witnesses.” Adequate discovery, however, does not mean unfettered discovery. As <i>Armendariz</i> recognized, an arbitration agreement might specify “something less than the full panoply of discovery provided in the California Code of Civil Procedure.”</p>
<p id="c0d5126f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Mercuro</i>, the California Court of Appeals applied the parameters set forth in <i>Armendariz</i> to Countrywide’s discovery provisions. It concluded that “without evidence showing how these discovery provisions are applied in practice, we are not prepared to say they would not necessarily prevent Mercuro from vindicating his statutory rights.” <i>Mercuro</i> relied heavily on the ability of the arbitrator to extend the discovery <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="558" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page558">p. 558</span>limits for “good cause.” In fact, <i>Mercuro</i> ultimately left it up to the arbitrator to balance the need for simplicity in arbitration with the discovery necessary for a party to vindicate her claims. Following the Court in <i>Mercuro</i>, we too find that Countrywide’s discovery provisions may afford Ferguson adequate discovery to vindicate her claims.</p>
<p id="c0d51270-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nevertheless, we recognize an insidious pattern in Countrywide’s arbitration agreement. Not only do these discovery provisions appear to favor Countrywide at the expense of its employees, but the entire agreement seems drawn to provide Countrywide with undue advantages should an employment-related dispute arise. Aside from merely availing itself of the cost-saving benefits of arbitration, Countrywide has sought to advantage itself substantively by tilting the playing field.</p>

We follow <i>Mercuro</i> in holding that the discovery provisions alone are not unconscionable, but in the context of an arbitration agreement which unduly favors Countrywide at every turn, we find that their inclusion reaffirms our belief that the arbitration agreement as a whole is substantively unconscionable.</p>

Even if GrowCo cannot invoke federal jurisdiction, however, it can still enforce the FAA in state courts, which are substantively bound by the provisions of the FAA.</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0d5609f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Ferguson v. Countrywide</i>, the court found that the California law of unconscionability squeezed inside the exceptions clause of the Arbitration Act because it was based on “such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.” In 2011, the Supreme Court reached the opposite conclusion in <i>AT&amp;T v. Concepcion</i>, a 5-4 decision involving a cell phone contract, finding that California law’s interpretation of unconscionability was preempted by the FAA. In the next case, the U.S. Supreme Court again came to a similar conclusion in a closely divided case (upholding the arbitration clause against challenge)—this time considering a federal statute rather than state law as a possible escape from arbitration. The majority and dissenting opinions offer good summaries of competing histories of the FAA.</p></li>

<p id="c0d560a5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Should employees and employers be allowed to agree that any disputes between them will be resolved through one-on-one arbitration? Or should employees always be permitted to bring their claims in class or collective actions, no matter what they agreed with their employers?</p>
<p id="c0d560a6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a matter of policy these questions are surely debatable. But as a matter of law the answer is clear. In the Federal Arbitration Act, Congress has instructed federal courts to enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms—including terms <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="560" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page560">p. 560</span>providing for individualized proceedings. Nor can we agree with the employees’ suggestion that the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) offers a conflicting command. It is this Court’s duty to interpret Congress’s statutes as a harmonious whole rather than at war with one another. And abiding that duty here leads to an unmistakable conclusion. The NLRA secures to employees rights to organize unions and bargain collectively, but it says nothing about how judges and arbitrators must try legal disputes that leave the workplace and enter the courtroom or arbitral forum. This Court has never read a right to class actions into the NLRA—and for three quarters of a century neither did the National Labor Relations Board. Far from conflicting, the Arbitration Act and the NLRA have long enjoyed separate spheres of influence and neither permits this Court to declare the parties’ agreements unlawful.</p>

<p id="c0d560a8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The three cases before us differ in detail but not in substance. Take <i>Ernst &amp; Young LLP v. Morris</i>. There Ernst &amp; Young and one of its junior accountants, Stephen Morris, entered into an agreement providing that they would arbitrate any disputes that might arise between them. The agreement stated that the employee could choose the arbitration provider and that the arbitrator could “grant any relief that could be granted by. . . . a court” in the relevant jurisdiction. The agreement also specified individualized arbitration, with claims “pertaining to different [e]mployees [to] be heard in separate proceedings.”</p>
<p id="c0d560a9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After his employment ended, and despite having agreed to arbitrate claims against the firm, Mr. Morris sued Ernst &amp; Young in federal court. He alleged that the firm had misclassified its junior accountants as professional employees and violated the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and California law by paying them salaries without overtime pay. Although the arbitration agreement provided for individualized proceedings, Mr. Morris sought to litigate the federal claim on behalf of a nationwide class under the FLSA’s collective action provision, 29 U.S.C. §216(b). He sought to pursue the state law claim as a class action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.</p>
<p id="c0d560aa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ernst &amp; Young replied with a motion to compel arbitration. The district court granted the request, but the Ninth Circuit reversed this judgment. The Ninth Circuit recognized that the Arbitration Act generally requires courts to enforce arbitration agreements as written. But the court reasoned that the statute’s “saving clause,” see 9 U.S.C. §2, removes this obligation if an arbitration agreement violates some other federal law. And the court concluded that an agreement requiring individualized arbitration proceedings violates the NLRA by barring employees from engaging in the “concerted activit[y],” of pursuing claims as a class or collective action. . . . </p>
<p id="c0d560ab-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the Arbitration Act and the NLRA have long coexisted—they date from 1925 and 1935, respectively—the suggestion they might conflict is something quite new. Until a couple of years ago, courts more or less agreed that arbitration agreements like those before us must be enforced according to their terms. . . . </p>
</div>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0d587bc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">II</p></div>
<p id="c0d587bd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We begin with the Arbitration Act and the question of its saving clause.</p>
<p id="c0d587be-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress adopted the Arbitration Act in 1925 in response to a perception that courts were unduly hostile to arbitration. No doubt there was much to that perception. <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="561" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page561">p. 561</span>Before 1925, English and American common law courts routinely refused to enforce agreements to arbitrate disputes. But in Congress’s judgment arbitration had more to offer than courts recognized—not least the promise of quicker, more informal, and often cheaper resolutions for everyone involved. So Congress directed courts to abandon their hostility and instead treat arbitration agreements as “valid, irrevocable, and enforceable.” 9 U.S.C. §2. The Act, this Court has said, establishes “a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.”</p>
<p id="c0d587bf-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not only did Congress require courts to respect and enforce agreements to arbitrate; it also specifically directed them to respect and enforce the parties’ chosen arbitration procedures.</p>
<p id="c0d587c0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On first blush, these emphatic directions would seem to resolve any argument under the Arbitration Act. The parties before us contracted for arbitration. They proceeded to specify the rules that would govern their arbitrations, indicating their intention to use individualized rather than class or collective action procedures. And this much the Arbitration Act seems to protect pretty absolutely. See AT&amp;T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333 (2011); <i>Italian Colors</i>, <i>supra</i>; DIRECTV, Inc. v. Imburgia, 577 U.S. ___ (2015). You might wonder if the balance Congress struck in 1925 between arbitration and litigation should be revisited in light of more contemporary developments. You might even ask if the Act was good policy when enacted. But all the same you might find it difficult to see how to avoid the statute’s application.</p>
<p id="c0d587c1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Still, the employees suggest the Arbitration Act’s saving clause creates an exception for cases like theirs. By its terms, the saving clause allows courts to refuse to enforce arbitration agreements “upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.” §2. That provision applies here, the employees tell us, because the NLRA renders their particular class and collective action waivers illegal. In their view, illegality under the NLRA is a “ground” that “exists at law. . . . for the revocation” of their arbitration agreements, at least to the extent those agreements prohibit class or collective action proceedings.</p>
<p id="c0d587c2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The problem with this line of argument is fundamental. . . . </p>
<p id="c0d587c3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The clause] can’t [apply] because the saving clause recognizes only defenses that apply to “any” contract. In this way the clause establishes a sort of “equal-treatment” rule for arbitration contracts. The clause “permits agreements to arbitrate to be invalidated by ’generally applicable contract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability.’” <i>Concepcion</i>. At the same time, the clause offers no refuge for “defenses that apply only to arbitration or that derive their meaning from the fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at issue.” Under our precedent, this means the saving clause does not save defenses that target arbitration either by name or by more subtle methods, such as by “interfer[ing] with fundamental attributes of arbitration.”</p>
<p id="c0d587c4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is where the employees’ argument stumbles. They don’t suggest that their arbitration agreements were extracted, say, by an act of fraud or duress or in some other unconscionable way that would render <i>any</i> contract unenforceable. Instead, they object to their agreements precisely because they require individualized arbitration proceedings instead of class or collective ones. And by attacking (only) the individualized nature of the arbitration proceedings, the employees’ argument seeks to interfere with one of arbitration’s fundamental attributes.</p>
<p id="c0d587c5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We know this much because of <i>Concepcion</i>. There this Court faced a state law defense that prohibited as unconscionable class action waivers in consumer contracts. <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="562" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page562">p. 562</span>The Court readily acknowledged that the defense formally applied in both the litigation and the arbitration context. But, the Court held, the defense failed to qualify for protection under the saving clause because it interfered with a fundamental attribute of arbitration all the same. It did so by effectively permitting any party in arbitration to demand classwide proceedings despite the traditionally individualized and informal nature of arbitration. This “fundamental” change to the traditional arbitration process, the Court said, would “sacrific[e] the principal advantage of arbitration—its informality—and mak[e] the process slower, more costly, and more likely to generate procedural morass than final judgment.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c0d587c6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, <i>Concepcion</i> has its limits. The Court recognized that parties remain free to alter arbitration procedures to suit their tastes, and in recent years some parties have sometimes chosen to arbitrate on a classwide basis. But <i>Concepcion</i>’s essential insight remains: courts may not allow a contract defense to reshape traditional individualized arbitration by mandating classwide arbitration procedures without the parties’ consent. Just as judicial antagonism toward arbitration before the Arbitration Act’s enactment “manifested itself in a great variety of devices and formulas declaring arbitration against public policy,” <i>Concepcion</i> teaches that we must be alert to new devices and formulas that would achieve much the same result today. And a rule seeking to declare individualized arbitration proceedings off limits is, the Court held, just such a device. . . . </p>
<p id="c0d587c7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Illegality [the term used by the NLRA statute], like unconscionability, may be a traditional, generally applicable contract defense in many cases, including arbitration cases. But an argument that a contract is unenforceable <i>just because it requires bilateral arbitration</i> is a different creature. A defense of that kind, <i>Concepcion</i> tells us, is one that impermissibly disfavors arbitration whether it sounds in illegality or unconscionability. The law of precedent teaches that like cases should generally be treated alike, and appropriate respect for that principle means the Arbitration Act’s saving clause can no more save the defense at issue in these cases than it did the defense at issue in <i>Concepcion</i>. At the end of our encounter with the Arbitration Act, then, it appears just as it did at the beginning: a congressional command requiring us to enforce, not override, the terms of the arbitration agreements before us.</p>

And rather than revive “yellow dog” contracts against union organizing that the NLRA outlawed back in 1935, today’s decision merely declines to read into the NLRA a novel <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="563" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page563">p. 563</span>right to class action procedures that the Board’s own general counsel disclaimed as recently as 2010. . . . </p>

While Congress is of course always free to amend this judgment, we see nothing suggesting it did so in the NLRA—much less that it manifested a clear intention to displace the Arbitration Act. Because we can easily read Congress’s statutes to work in harmony, that is where our duty lies. The judgments in <i>Epic</i> and <i>Ernst &amp; Young</i> are reversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

<p id="c0d5aee1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The employees in these cases complain that their employers have underpaid them in violation of the wage and hours prescriptions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) and analogous state laws<i>.</i> Individually, their claims are small, scarcely of a size warranting the expense of seeking redress alone. But by joining together with others similarly circumstanced, employees can gain effective redress for wage underpayment commonly experienced. To block such concerted action, their employers required them to sign, as a condition of employment, arbitration agreements banning collective judicial and arbitral proceedings of any kind. The question presented: Does the Federal Arbitration Act permit employers to insist that their employees, whenever seeking redress for commonly experienced wage loss, go it alone, never mind the right secured to employees by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) “to engage in. . . . concerted activities” for their “mutual aid or protection"? The answer should be a resounding “No.”</p>
<p id="c0d5aee2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the NLRA and its forerunner, the Norris-LaGuardia Act (NLGA), 29 U.S.C. §101 <i>et seq.</i>, Congress acted on an acute awareness: For workers striving to gain from their employers decent terms and conditions of employment, there is strength in numbers. A single employee, Congress understood, is disarmed in dealing with an employer. The Court today subordinates employee-protective labor legislation to the Arbitration Act. In so doing, the Court forgets the labor market imbalance that gave rise to the NLGA and the NLRA, and ignores the destructive consequences of diminishing the right of employees “to band together in confronting an employer.” Congressional correction of the Court’s elevation of the FAA over workers’ rights to act in concert is urgently in order.</p>
<p id="c0d5aee3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To explain why the Court’s decision is egregiously wrong, I first refer to the extreme imbalance once prevalent in our Nation’s workplaces, and Congress’ aim in the NLGA and the NLRA to place employers and employees on a more equal footing. I then explain why the Arbitration Act, sensibly read, does not shrink the NLRA’s protective sphere. . . . </p>
<p id="c0d5aee4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="564" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page564">p. 564</span>The end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th was a tumultuous era in the history of our Nation’s labor relations. Under economic conditions then prevailing, workers often had to accept employment on whatever terms employers dictated. Aiming to secure better pay, shorter workdays, and safer workplaces, workers increasingly sought to band together to make their demands effective. . . . </p>
<p id="c0d5d5f5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Early legislative efforts to protect workers’ rights to band together were unavailing . . . </p>
<p id="c0d5d5f6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the 1930’s, legislative efforts to safeguard vulnerable workers found more receptive audiences. As the Great Depression shifted political winds further in favor of worker-protective laws, Congress passed two statutes aimed at protecting employees’ associational rights. First, in 1932, Congress passed the NLGA, which regulates the employer-employee relationship indirectly. Section 2 of the Act declares:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0d5d5f7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Whereas. . . . the individual unorganized worker is commonly helpless to exercise actual liberty of contract and to protect his freedom of labor,. . . . it is necessary that he have full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of his own choosing,. . . . and that he shall be free from the interference, restraint, or coercion of employers. . . . in the designation of such representatives or in self-organization or in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.” 29 U.S.C. §102. . . . </p>
</div>
<p id="c0d5d5f8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But Congress did so three years later, in 1935, when it enacted the NLRA. Relevant here, §7 of the NLRA guarantees employees “the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, <i>and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection</i>.” 29 U.S.C. §157 (emphasis added). Section 8(a)(1) safeguards those rights by making it an “unfair labor practice” for an employer to “interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in [§7].” §158(a)(1). . . . </p>
<p id="c0d5d5f9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite the NLRA’s prohibitions, the employers in the cases now before the Court required their employees to sign contracts stipulating to submission of wage and hours claims to binding arbitration, and to do so only one-by-one. When employees subsequently filed wage and hours claims in federal court and sought to invoke the collective-litigation procedures provided for in the FLSA and Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the employers moved to compel individual arbitration. The Arbitration Act, in their view, requires courts to enforce their take-it-or-leave-it arbitration agreements as written, including the collective-litigation abstinence demanded therein.</p>
<p id="c0d5d5fa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In resisting enforcement of the group-action foreclosures, the employees involved in this litigation do not urge that they must have access to a judicial forum. They argue only that the NLRA prohibits their employers from denying them the right to pursue work-related claims in concert in any forum. If they may be stopped by employer-dictated terms from pursuing collective procedures in court, they maintain, they must at least have access to similar procedures in an arbitral forum. . . . </p>
<p id="c0d5d5fb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suits to enforce workplace rights collectively fit comfortably under the umbrella “concerted activities for the purpose of. . . . mutual aid or protection.” 29 U.S.C. §157. “Concerted” means “[p]lanned or accomplished together; combined.” American Heritage Dictionary 381 (5th ed. 2011). “Mutual” means “reciprocal.” <i>Id.,</i> at 1163. When employees meet the requirements for litigation of shared legal claims in <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="565" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page565">p. 565</span>joint, collective, and class proceedings, the litigation of their claims is undoubtedly “accomplished together.” By joining hands in litigation, workers can spread the costs of litigation and reduce the risk of employer retaliation. . . . </p>
<p id="c0d5d5fc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In face of the NLRA’s text, history, purposes, and longstanding construction, the Court nevertheless concludes that collective proceedings do not fall within the scope of §7.

<p id="c0d5d5fd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The inevitable result of today’s decision will be the underenforcement of federal and state statutes designed to advance the well-being of vulnerable workers. . . . </p>

The FAA demands no such suppression of the right of workers to take concerted action for their “mutual aid or protection.” Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the Fifth Circuit in No. 16-307 and affirm the judgments of the Seventh and Ninth Circuits in Nos. 16-285 and 16-300.</p>

No, the Court said, these statutes created no such exception.</p></li>
<li><p id="c0d62423-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Just below that level is another disagreement: What is the purpose underlying the FAA? For the dissent, that statute merely removed hostility to the enforcement of arbitration clauses, hostility said to have been embedded in state law. For the majority, the FAA went further—not just permitting but <i>encouraging</i> arbitration, and in close cases it should be read to achieve that goal. It’s fair to say that most of the academic commentary embraces the dissent’s view of FAA history, but the Supreme Court gets the last word here.</p></li>
<li><p id="c0d62424-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At a third level down, the Court faced a very difficult problem: that of deciding how several Congresses (that had passed first the FAA and then the pair of labor statutes involved) would have felt about class action waivers. The class action technically existed at the time of these statutes but had taken nothing like its present form—which it assumed only in 1966 with the amendment of Rule 23. Would the Congresses that passed these statutes have smiled or frowned upon the use of collective litigation to enforce the wage statutes, and would they have smiled or frowned upon the use of arbitration clauses to avoid such collective litigation?</p></li>

International contracts include arbitration clauses more than domestic contracts, but also at a surprisingly low rate. Our results have implications for the justifications for the widespread use of arbitration clauses in consumer contracts. If the reasons that some have advanced to support the use of arbitration in the consumer context—that it is simpler and cheaper than litigation—are correct, it is surprising that public companies do not seek these advantages in disputes among themselves. In the simple economic view, our results suggest that corporate representatives believe that litigation can add value over arbitration.</p>

But consider a quite different—more creative—form of arbitration that bears no resemblance to adjudication and has been in place in the entertainment industry for decades.</p>

<p id="c0d67251-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Screenwriting credits—the names that scroll on the screen at the start or end of a film or similar production—can be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in future writing engagements as well as a larger share of profits from screenings, DVDs, and online sales. Writers, directors, and producers of such entertainment sometimes disagree about who should get credit. Writers have a union—called in Hollywood parlance a “guild"—that has worked out a way of arbitrating such credits when there is a disagreement. As a case described it:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0d67252-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The basic agreement contains, in a section entitled theatrical schedule A, detailed provisions concerning writing credits for feature-length theatrical photo-plays. Under schedule A, the production company must notify all participating writers of its tentative credits determination. Any of the writers may then file with the production company and the Writers Guild a written request for arbitration of credits. . . . </p>
<p id="c0d67253-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The credits manual, discussed below, sets forth the procedures the Writers Guild has adopted. . . . The credit arbitration is administered by the Writers Guild’s credit arbitration secretary. When a credit arbitration is requested, this officer sends the parties to the arbitration a screen arbiter’s list, containing the names of all potential arbitrators. These are Writers Guild members with credit arbitration experience or with at least three screenplay credits of their own. This list comprised at least 400 names in 1987. Each party can peremptorily disqualify a reasonable number of persons from the list. From the remaining potential arbitrators, the secretary selects three, endeavoring to select individuals experienced in the type of writing involved in the particular case.</p>
<p id="c0d67254-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The secretary delivers to the three arbitrators all script, outline, and story material prepared or used in the creation of the screenplay, together with source material (writings upon which the screenplay or story is based). These documents are supplied to the Writers Guild by the production company, and each participant in the credit arbitration may examine them to assure the inclusion of everything he or she has written. Any dispute over the “authenticity, identification, sequence, authorship or completeness” of literary material to be included is resolved by a special three-member committee, which conducts for that purpose a prearbitration hearing, at which all affected writers may present testimony and other evidence.</p>
<p id="c0d67255-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The arbitrators also receive the production company’s statement of tentative credits; a copy of the credits manual; and the statements of the parties, which are confidential.

Indeed, each remains unaware of the identity of the other two (unless, after they reach their decisions, the consultant convenes a meeting with the three). Each arbitrator notifies the secretary of his or her determination. The secretary then informs the parties of the decision of the majority of the arbitrators.</p>
<p id="c0d67257-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Within 24 hours thereafter, any party may request the convening of a policy review board, consisting of three members of the Writers Guild’s credits committee including that committee’s chairman or vice-chairman. The policy review board does not examine the script, story, or source material; indeed, its members are forbidden to read these. Its function is solely to detect any substantial deviation from the policy of the Writers Guild or from the procedure set forth in the credits manual. The policy review board has authority to direct the arbitration committee to reconsider the case or to order a fresh arbitration by a new triumvirate. The policy review board is not empowered to reverse the decision of an arbitration committee in matters of judgment. A decision of the policy review board approving a credit determination is final.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0d6725a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If a judge renders a decision, in most U.S. jurisdictions the decision can be appealed. What about arbitrators’ awards? The general proposition is that appeal to a court is possible but not generally useful because the court will narrowly restrict the scope of its review: Was the arbitrator bribed or did the procedure violate fundamental fairness? For some parties the inability to appeal an arbitration award is an advantage: It eliminates a source of delay. For others, it is a disadvantage: It puts the parties at the mercy of an arbitrator who may be interpreting a new statute or an especially unusual contract.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0d6725c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Could the parties provide that an appellate court would review an arbitrator’s award? In the federal courts the answer is almost certainly no. The basic jurisdictional statute of the circuit courts limits their power to the review of “final decisions of the district courts of the United States.” 28 U.S.C. §1291. But that statute does not control states’ appellate process, and one can imagine a state legislature allowing its courts to hear such cases.</p></li>

<p id="c0d6996f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose there is no arbitration agreement, or that it is unenforceable. Litigation ensues. Your client is open to settlement, but negotiations prove fruitless. Or your client wants something that only adjudication can deliver—for example, a binding public declaration of rights. Is trial inevitable? No. A court can grant summary judgment in cases in which there is no material factual dispute. The key provision, in Rule 56(a), provides that “the court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Courts interpret this provision to mean that summary judgment should be granted if, given the evidence presented, no reasonable jury could find for the nonmoving party. Summary judgment may be appropriate because the critical dispute concerns the law—does the First Amendment forbid a school district from requiring pupils to recite the Pledge of Allegiance? Or summary judgment may be appropriate in a case where the law was clear but one party lacked evidence supporting a critical element of her case. In either circumstance, trial is pointless because no reasonable jury could find for one side or the other. This section explores the possibilities and limits of summary judgment.</p>

<p id="c0d6e7af-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having considered the role of summary judgment and the ways in which parties seek and defend against summary judgment motions, we turn to the application of the summary judgment standard. Just as the standards of pleading have changed in recent years, the standards for summary judgment have shifted since the initial promulgation of the Rules. Before 1938, summary judgment was available only under limited circumstances; the Federal Rules promulgated in 1938 made summary judgment available to all parties and claims. It was, though, used sparingly by judges, who may have perceived summary judgment as infringing on parties’ right to a trial. In three cases decided in 1986—<i>Celotex</i>, <i>Anderson</i>, and <i>Matsushita</i>—the Supreme Court interpreted the summary judgment standard in ways that gave courts broader authority to grant summary judgment. Since 1986, parties—usually though not always defendants—have brought summary judgment motions with increasing frequency. Today, more cases end at summary judgment than at trial. In the remainder of this chapter, we will consider the impact of each of these cases on summary judgment practice.</p>
<p id="c0d6e7b0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first, <i>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett</i>, focuses on what the party moving for summary judgment must do, in the absence of any opposition, to justify a court’s granting its motion. Before <i>Celotex</i>, the leading case on federal summary judgment was Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., 398 U.S. 144 (1970). <i>Adickes</i> grew out of a civil rights demonstration in which plaintiff, refused service at a racially segregated lunch counter, sued the restaurant owner. At the time, the federal public accommodations laws provided no damages remedy for private discrimination, and the liability of the business therefore depended on whether it had acted in concert with the local authorities, thereby fulfilling the state action requirement of 42 U.S.C. §1983. All agreed that there had been a police officer in the store at the time service was refused, but plaintiff produced no evidence showing communication between the officer and any store employee. The defendant submitted affidavits and deposition transcripts from the store manager and the police officer that they had not communicated with each other and that the manager had refused service because he was concerned about “a riot.” The Supreme Court said: “Our own scrutiny of the factual allegations of petitioner’s complaint, as well as the material found in the affidavits and depositions presented by Kress to the District Court, however, convinces us that summary judgment was improper here, for we think <i>respondent</i> [the defendant store] <i>failed to carry its burden of <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="573" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page573">p. 573</span>showing the absence of any genuine</i> issue of fact.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A84_d543d88d-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10A84_d543d88d-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">6</a></span> Id. at 153 (emphasis added).

<p id="c0d6e7b2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think that on the basis of this record, it was error to grant summary judgment. As the moving party, respondent had the burden of showing the absence of a genuine issue as to any material fact, and for these purposes the material it lodged must be viewed in the light most favorable to the opposing party. Respondent here did not carry its burden because of its failure to <i>foreclose the possibility</i> that there was a policeman in the Kress store while petitioner was awaiting service, and that this policeman reached an understanding with some Kress employee that petitioner not be served.</p>

<p id="c0d70eca-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . Respondent commenced this lawsuit in September 1980, alleging that the death. . . . of her husband. . . . resulted from his exposure to products containing asbestos manufactured or distributed by 15 named corporations. . . . Petitioner’s motion [for summary judgment]. . . . argued that summary judgment was proper because respondent had “failed to produce evidence that any [Celotex] product. . . . was the proximate cause of the injuries allege. . . . ” In particular, petitioner noted that respondent had failed to identify, in answering interrogatories specifically requesting such information, any witnesses who could testify about the decedent’s exposure to petitioner’s asbestos products. In response to petitioner’s summary judgment motion, respondent then produced three documents which she claimed “demonstrate that there is a genuine material factual dispute” as to whether the decedent had ever been exposed to petitioner’s asbestos products. The three documents included a transcript of a deposition of the decedent, a letter from an official of one of the decedent’s former employers whom petitioner planned to call as a trial witness, and a letter from an insurance company to respondent’s attorney, all tending to establish that the decedent had been exposed to petitioner’s asbestos products in Chicago. <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="574" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page574">p. 574</span>Petitioner, in turn, argued that the three documents were inadmissible hearsay and thus could not be considered in opposition to the summary judgment motion.</p>
<p id="c0d70ecb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . The District Court granted. . . . the motion. . . . because “there [was] no showing that the plaintiff was exposed to the defendant Celotex’s product in the District of Columbia or elsewhere within the statutory period.” [The court of appeals reversed.] According to the majority, Rule 56(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and this Court’s decision in Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., 398 U.S. 144, 159 (1970), establish that “the party opposing the motion for summary judgment bears the burden of responding <i>only after</i> the moving party has met its burden of coming forward with proof of the absence of any genuine issues of material fact.” 244 U.S. App. D.C., at 163, 756 F.2d, at 184 (emphasis in original; footnote omitted). The majority therefore declined to consider petitioner’s argument that none of the evidence produced by respondent in opposition to the motion for summary judgment would have been admissible at trial.</p>
<p id="c0d70ecc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . We think that the position taken by the majority of the Court of Appeals is inconsistent with the standard for summary judgment set forth in Rule 56[(a)] of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. . . . In our view, the plain language of Rule 56[(a)] mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery. . . . against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. In such a situation, there can be “no genuine [dispute] as to any material fact,” since a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party’s case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial. The moving party is “entitled to judgment as a matter of law” because the nonmoving party has failed to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of her case with respect to which she has the burden of proof. “[The] standard [for granting summary judgment] mirrors the standard for a directed verdict under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a. . . . ” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 250 (1986).</p>
<p id="c0d70ecd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, a party seeking summary judgment always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of ["particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations. . . . admissions, interrogatory answers [quoting Rule 56(c)(1)]"] which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine [dispute]. But unlike the Court of Appeals, we find no express or implied requirement in Rule 56 that the moving party support its motions with affidavits or other similar materials <i>negating</i> the opponent’s claim. On the contrary, Rule 56(c), which refers to “pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admission on file, together with the affidavits if <i>any</i>”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10AFF_d543d88d-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10AFF_d543d88d-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">7</a></span> (emphasis added), suggests the absence of such a requirement. . . . One of the principal purposes of the summary judgment rule is to isolate and dispose of factually unsupported claims or defenses, and we think it should be interpreted in a way that enables it to accomplish this purpose. . . . </p>
<p id="c0d70ecf-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="575" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page575">p. 575</span>We do not mean that the nonmoving party must produce evidence in a form that would be admissible at trial in order to avoid summary judgment. Obviously, Rule 56 does not require the nonmoving party to depose her own witness. Rule 56[(a)] permits a proper summary judgment motion to be opposed by any of the kinds of evidentiary materials listed in Rule 56(c), except the mere pleadings themselves. . . . </p>
<p id="c0d70ed0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeals in this case felt itself constrained, however, by language in Adickes v. S. H. Kress &amp; Co., 398 U.S. 144 (1970). There we held that summary judgment had been improperly entered in favor of the defendant. . . . <i>Adickes</i>. . . . said. . . . “both the commentary on and the background of the 1963 Amendment conclusively show that it was not intended to modify the burden of the moving party. . . . to show initially the absence of a genuine issue concerning any material fact.” We think that this statement is accurate in a literal sense. . . . But we do not think the <i>Adickes</i> language quoted above should be construed to mean that the burden is on the party moving for summary judgment to produce evidence showing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, even with respect to an issue on which the nonmoving party bears the burden of proof. Instead, as we have explained, the burden on the moving party may be discharged by “showing"—that is, pointing out to the District Court—that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party’s case. . . . </p>
<p id="c0d735e1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our conclusion is bolstered by the fact that district courts are widely acknowledged to possess the power to enter summary judgments sua sponte, so long as the losing party was on notice that she had to come forward with all of her evidence. It would surely defy common sense to hold that the District Court could have entered summary judgment sua sponte in favor of petitioner in the instant case, but that petitioner’s filing of a motion requesting such a disposition precluded the District Court from ordering it.</p>
<p id="c0d735e2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent commenced this action in September 1980, and petitioner’s motion was filed in September 1981. The parties had conducted discovery, and no serious claim can be made that the respondent was in any sense “railroaded” by a premature motion for summary judgment. Any potential problem with such premature motions can be adequately dealt with under Rule 56[(d)], which allows a summary judgment motion to be denied, or the hearing on the motion to be continued, if the nonmoving party has not had an opportunity to make full discovery.</p>
<p id="c0d735e3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this Court, respondent’s brief and oral argument have been devoted as much to the proposition that an adequate showing of exposure to petitioner’s asbestos products was made as to the proposition that no such showing should have been required. But the Court of Appeals declined to address either. . . . We think the Court of Appeals. . . . is better suited than we are to make these determinations in the first instance. . . . Summary judgment procedure is properly regarded not as a disfavored procedural shortcut, but rather as an integral part of the Federal Rules as a whole, which are designed “to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 1. Before the shift to “notice pleading” accomplished by the Federal Rules, motions to dismiss a complaint or to strike a defense were the principal tools by which factually insufficient claims or defenses could be isolated and prevented from going to trial. . . . But with the advent of “notice pleading,” the motion to dismiss seldom fulfills this function any more, and its place has been taken by the motion for summary judgment. . . . </p>

It asserts, however, that respondent has failed on request to produce any basis for her case. Respondent, on the other hand, does not contend that she was not obligated to reveal her witnesses and evidence but insists that she has revealed enough to defeat the motion for summary judgment. Because the Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to address this aspect of the case, I agree that the case should be remanded for further proceedings.</p>

One way of understanding the answers to these questions is to consider the burdens on the parties at trial. At trial, Celotex, the defendant, could prevail in two ways. It could prove that Mr. Catrett was not exposed to its asbestos by demonstrating that neither it nor its predecessor companies had ever manufactured asbestos—unlikely given that asbestos was a principal part of its business at that time. Or it could prevail if Mrs. Catrett <i>failed to show</i> that Mr. Catrett was exposed to its asbestos, perhaps by convincing a jury that the sole testimony linking Mr. Catrett to Celotex asbestos was not credible because the witness had been bribed.</p>

This alignment of burdens at summary judgment with burdens at trial means that the standard for summary judgment will apply differently depending on which party is moving for summary judgment. To see this point, suppose that one of the issues in contention is whether asbestosis (as opposed to some other disease) caused Mr. Catrett’s death. Mrs. Catrett’s complaint alleges that asbestosis caused her husband’s death; Celotex denies that allegation in its answer.

<p id="c0d78426-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The other two cases in the so-called summary judgment trilogy—<i>Anderson</i> and <i>Matsushita</i>—set out the Supreme Court’s view about how courts should assess competing information offered by opposing sides at summary judgment. The Court in <i>Anderson</i> explained that “summary judgment will not lie if the dispute about a material fact is ’genuine,’ that is, if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party” and that, in making this assessment, “[t]he evidence of the nonmovant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.” The Court in <i>Matsushita</i> gave district courts discretion to assess the plausibility of the parties’ contentions and grant summary judgment if the nonmoving party could show only “some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.” Consider the ways in which the next two decisions interpret and apply these standards.</p>

<p id="c0d7ab3c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During the early morning hours of New Year’s Eve, 2008, police sergeant Jeffrey Cotton fired three bullets at Robert Tolan; one of those bullets hit its target and punctured Tolan’s right lung. At the time of the shooting, Tolan was unarmed on his parents’ front porch about 15 to 20 feet away from Cotton. Tolan sued, alleging that Cotton had exercised excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The District Court granted summary judgment to Cotton. In articulating the factual context of the case, the Fifth Circuit failed to adhere to the axiom that in ruling on a motion for summary judgment, “[t]he evidence of the nonmovant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986). For that reason, we vacate its decision and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

<p id="c0d7ab3f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The following facts, which we view in the light most favorable to Tolan, are taken from the record evidence and the opinions below. At around 2:00 on the morning of December 31, 2008, John Edwards, a police officer, was on patrol in Bellaire, Texas, when he noticed a black Nissan sport utility vehicle turning quickly onto a residential <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="580" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page580">p. 580</span>street. The officer watched the vehicle park on the side of the street in front of a house. Two men exited: Tolan and his cousin, Anthony Cooper.</p>
<p id="c0d7ab40-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Edwards attempted to enter the license plate number of the vehicle into a computer in his squad car. But he keyed an incorrect character; instead of entering plate number 696BGK, he entered 695BGK. That incorrect number matched a stolen vehicle of the same color and make. This match caused the squad car’s computer to send an automatic message to other police units, informing them that Edwards had found a stolen vehicle.</p>
<p id="c0d7ab41-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Edwards exited his cruiser, drew his service pistol and ordered Tolan and Cooper to the ground. He accused Tolan and Cooper of having stolen the car. Cooper responded, “That’s not true.” And Tolan explained, “That’s my car.” Tolan then complied with the officer’s demand to lie face-down on the home’s front porch.</p>
<p id="c0d7ab42-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As it turned out, Tolan and Cooper were at the home where Tolan lived with his parents. Hearing the commotion, Tolan’s parents exited the front door in their pajamas. In an attempt to keep the misunderstanding from escalating into something more, Tolan’s father instructed Cooper to lie down, and instructed Tolan and Cooper to say nothing. Tolan and Cooper then remained face-down.</p>
<p id="c0d7ab43-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Edwards told Tolan’s parents that he believed Tolan and Cooper had stolen the vehicle. In response, Tolan’s father identified Tolan as his son, and Tolan’s mother explained that the vehicle belonged to the family and that no crime had been committed. Tolan’s father explained, with his hands in the air, “[T]his is my nephew. This is my son. We live here. This is my house.” Tolan’s mother similarly offered, “[S]ir this is a big mistake. This car is not stolen. . . . That’s our car.”</p>
<p id="c0d7ab44-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While Tolan and Cooper continued to lie on the ground in silence, Edwards radioed for assistance. Shortly thereafter, Sergeant Jeffrey Cotton arrived on the scene and drew his pistol. Edwards told Cotton that Cooper and Tolan had exited a stolen vehicle. Tolan’s mother reiterated that she and her husband owned both the car Tolan had been driving and the home where these events were unfolding. Cotton then ordered her to stand against the family’s garage door. In response to Cotton’s order, Tolan’s mother asked, “[A]re you kidding me? We’ve lived her[e] 15 years. We’ve never had anything like this happen before.”</p>
<p id="c0d7ab45-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The parties disagree as to what happened next. Tolan’s mother and Cooper testified during Cotton’s criminal trial that Cotton grabbed her arm and slammed her against the garage door with such force that she fell to the ground. Tolan similarly testified that Cotton pushed his mother against the garage door. In addition, Tolan offered testimony from his mother and photographic evidence to demonstrate that Cotton used enough force to leave bruises on her arms and back that lasted for days. By contrast, Cotton testified in his deposition that when he was escorting the mother to the garage, she flipped her arm up and told him to get his hands off her. He also testified that he did not know whether he left bruises but believed that he had not.</p>
<p id="c0d7ab46-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The parties also dispute the manner in which Tolan responded. Tolan testified in his deposition and during the criminal trial that upon seeing his mother being pushed, he rose to his knees. Edwards and Cotton testified that Tolan rose to his feet.</p>
<p id="c0d7d257-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both parties agree that Tolan then exclaimed, from roughly 15 to 20 feet away, “[G]et your fucking hands off my mom.” The parties also agree that Cotton then drew <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="581" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page581">p. 581</span>his pistol and fired three shots at Tolan. Tolan and his mother testified that these shots came with no verbal warning. One of the bullets entered Tolan’s chest, collapsing his right lung and piercing his liver. While Tolan survived, he suffered a life-altering injury that disrupted his budding professional baseball career and causes him to experience pain on a daily basis.</p>

<p id="c0d7d259-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In May 2009, Cooper, Tolan, and Tolan’s parents filed this suit in the Southern District of Texas, alleging claims under Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U.S.C. §1983. Tolan claimed, among other things, that Cotton had used excessive force against him in violation of the Fourth Amendment. After discovery, Cotton moved for summary judgment.</p>
<p id="c0d7d25a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District Court granted summary judgment to Cotton. It reasoned that Cotton’s use of force was not unreasonable and therefore did not violate the Fourth Amendment. The Fifth Circuit affirmed.</p>
<p id="c0d7d25b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In reaching this conclusion, the Fifth Circuit began by noting that at the time Cotton shot Tolan, “it was. . . . clearly established that an officer had the right to use deadly force if that officer harbored an objective and reasonable belief that a suspect presented an ’immediate threat to [his] safety.’” The Court of Appeals reasoned that Tolan failed to overcome th[at] bar because “an objectively-reasonable officer in Sergeant Cotton’s position could have. . . . believed” that Tolan “presented an ’immediate threat to the safety of the officers.’” In support of this conclusion, the court relied on the following facts: the front porch had been “dimly-lit”; Tolan’s mother had “refus[ed] orders to remain quiet and calm”; and Tolan’s words had amounted to a “verba[l] threa[t].” Most critically, the court also relied on the purported fact that Tolan was “moving to intervene in” Cotton’s handling of his mother, and that Cotton therefore could reasonably have feared for his life. Accordingly, the court held, Cotton did not violate clearly established law in shooting Tolan. . . . </p>

<p id="c0d7d25e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In holding that Cotton’s actions did not violate clearly established law, the Fifth Circuit failed to view the evidence at summary judgment in the light most favorable to Tolan with respect to the central facts of this case. By failing to credit evidence that contradicted some of its key factual conclusions, the court improperly “weigh[ed] the evidence” and resolved disputed issues in favor of the moving party, <i>Anderson</i>, 477 U.S., at 249.</p>
<p id="c0d7d25f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, the court relied on its view that at the time of the shooting, the Tolans’ front porch was “dimly-lit.” The court appears to have drawn this assessment from Cotton’s statements in a deposition that when he fired at Tolan, the porch was “’fairly dark,’” and lit by a gas lamp that was “’decorative.’” In his own deposition, however, Tolan’s father was asked whether the gas lamp was in fact “more decorative than illuminating.” He said that it was not. Moreover, Tolan stated in his deposition that two <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="582" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page582">p. 582</span>floodlights shone on the driveway during the incident, and Cotton acknowledged that there were two motion-activated lights in front of the house. And Tolan confirmed that at the time of the shooting, he was “not in darkness.”</p>
<p id="c0d7d260-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the Fifth Circuit stated that Tolan’s mother “refus[ed] orders to remain quiet and calm,” thereby “compound[ing]” Cotton’s belief that Tolan “presented an immediate threat to the safety of the officers.” But here, too, the court did not credit directly contradictory evidence. Although the parties agree that Tolan’s mother repeatedly informed officers that Tolan was her son, that she lived in the home in front of which he had parked, and that the vehicle he had been driving belonged to her and her husband, there is a dispute as to how calmly she provided this information. Cotton stated during his deposition that Tolan’s mother was “very agitated” when she spoke to the officers. By contrast, Tolan’s mother testified at Cotton’s criminal trial that she was neither “aggravated” nor “agitated.”</p>
<p id="c0d7d261-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, the Court concluded that Tolan was “shouting,” and “verbally threatening” the officer, in the moments before the shooting. The court noted, and the parties agree, that while Cotton was grabbing the arm of his mother, Tolan told Cotton, “[G]et your fucking hands off my mom.” But Tolan testified that he “was not screaming.” And a jury could reasonably infer that his words, in context, did not amount to a statement of intent to inflict harm. Tolan’s mother testified in Cotton’s criminal trial that he slammed her against a garage door with enough force to cause bruising that lasted for days. A jury could well have concluded that a reasonable officer would have heard Tolan’s words not as a threat, but as a son’s plea not to continue any assault of his mother.</p>
<p id="c0d7d262-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fourth, the Fifth Circuit inferred that at the time of the shooting, Tolan was “moving to intervene in Sergeant Cotton’s” interaction with his mother. The court appears to have credited Edwards’ account that at the time of the shooting, Tolan was on both feet “[i]n a crouch” or a “charging position” looking as if he was going to move forward. Tolan testified at trial, however, that he was on his knees when Cotton shot him, a fact corroborated by his mother. Tolan also testified in his deposition that he “wasn’t going anywhere,” and emphasized that he did not “jump up.”</p>
<p id="c0d7d263-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Considered together, these facts lead to the inescapable conclusion that the court below credited the evidence of the party seeking summary judgment and failed properly to acknowledge key evidence offered by the party opposing that motion. And while “this Court is not equipped to correct every perceived error coming from the lower federal courts,” Boag v. MacDougall, 454 U.S. 364, 366 (1982) (O’Connor, J., concurring), we intervene here because the opinion below reflects a clear misapprehension of summary judgment standards in light of our precedents.</p>
<p id="c0d7d264-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The witnesses on both sides come to this case with their own perceptions, recollections, and even potential biases. It is in part for that reason that genuine disputes are generally resolved by juries in our adversarial system. By weighing the evidence and reaching factual inferences contrary to Tolan’s competent evidence, the court below neglected to adhere to the fundamental principle that at the summary judgment stage, reasonable inferences should be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party.</p>
<p id="c0d7d265-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying that principle here, the court should have acknowledged and credited Tolan’s evidence with regard to the lighting, his mother’s demeanor, whether he <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="583" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page583">p. 583</span>shouted words that were an overt threat, and his positioning during the shooting. . . . The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

<p id="c0d7f984-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On April 7, 1986, after the close of his college basketball career, Bias entered into a representation agreement with Advantage whereby Advantage agreed to advise and represent Bias in his affairs. Fentress was the particular Advantage representative servicing the Bias account. On June 17 of that year Bias was picked by the Boston Celtics in the first round of the National Basketball Association draft. On the morning of <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="584" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page584">p. 584</span>June 19, 1986, Bias died of cocaine intoxication. The Estate sued Advantage and Fentress for. . . . injuries allegedly arising out of the representation arrangement between Bias and the defendants.</p>
<p id="c0d7f985-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he Estate alleges that, prior to Bias’s death, Bias and his parents directed Fentress to obtain a one-million dollar life insurance policy on Bias’s life, that Fentress represented to Bias and Bias’s parents that he had secured such a policy, and that in reliance on Fentress’s assurances, Bias’s parents did not independently seek to buy an insurance policy on Bias’s life. . . . [D]efendants. . . . did not secure any life insurance coverage for Bias prior to his death. . . . </p>

The District Court based this conclusion on the facts, about which it found no genuine issue, that Bias was a cocaine user and that no insurer in 1986 would have issued a one-million dollar life insurance policy, or “jumbo” policy, to a cocaine user unless the applicant made a misrepresentation regarding the applicant’s use of drugs, thereby rendering the insurance policy void. . . . </p>

<p id="c0d7f989-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has stated that the moving party always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion and identifying those portions of the record which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. <i>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett</i>. The Supreme Court also explained that summary judgment is appropriate, no matter which party is the moving party, where a party fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. Thus, the moving party must explain its reasons for concluding that the record does not reveal any genuine issues of material fact, and must make a showing supporting its claims insofar as those claims involve issues on which it will bear the burden at trial.</p>
<p id="c0d7f98a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once the moving party has carried its burden, the responsibility then shifts to the nonmoving party to show that there is, in fact, a genuine issue of material fact. The Supreme Court has directed that the nonmoving party “must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.” Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio, 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986). The nonmoving party “must come forward with ’specific facts showing that there is a <i>genuine issue for trial.</i>’” (emphasis in original). In evaluating the nonmovant’s proffer, a court must of course draw from the evidence all justifiable inferences in favor of the nonmovant. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986).</p>

<p id="c0d8209c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District Court’s determination that there was no genuine issue involving Bias’s insurability rests on two subsidiary conclusions: First, the District Court concluded that there was no genuine issue as to the fact that Bias was a drug user. Second, the District Court held that there was no dispute about the fact that as a drug user, Bias could not have obtained a jumbo life insurance policy. We can only affirm the District Court’s award of summary judgment to the defendants on the insurance issue if both of these conclusions were correct.</p>

<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0d8209d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">A. Bias’s Prior Drug Use</p></div>
<p id="c0d8209e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendants in this case offered the eyewitness testimony of two former teammates of Bias, Terry Long and David Gregg, in order to show that Bias was a cocaine user during the period prior to his death. Long and Gregg both described numerous occasions when they saw Bias ingest cocaine, and Long testified that he was introduced to cocaine by Bias and that Bias sometimes supplied others with cocaine.</p>
<p id="c0d8209f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although on appeal the Estate attempts to discredit the testimony of Long and Gregg, the Estate did not seek to impeach the testimony of these witnesses before the District Court, and the Estate made no effort to depose these witnesses. Instead, the Estate offered affidavits from each of Bias’s parents stating that Bias was not a drug user; the deposition testimony of Bias’s basketball coach, Charles “Lefty” Driesell, who testified that he knew Bias well for four years and never knew Bias to be a user of drugs at any time prior to his death; and the results of several drug tests administered to Bias during the four years prior to his death which may have shown that, on the occasions when the tests were administered, there were no traces in Bias’s system of the drugs for which he was tested.</p>
<p id="c0d820a0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the Estate’s generalized evidence that Bias was not a drug user did not contradict the more specific testimony of teammates who knew Bias well and had seen him use cocaine on particular occasions, the District Court determined that there was no genuine issue as to the fact that Bias was a drug user. We agree.</p>
<p id="c0d820a1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no question that the defendants satisfied their initial burden on the issue of Bias’s drug use. The testimony of Long and Gregg clearly tends to show that Bias was a cocaine user. We also agree with the District Court that the Estate did not rebut the defendants’ showing. The testimony of Bias’s parents to the effect that they knew Bias well and did not know him to be a drug user does not rebut the Long and Gregg testimony about Bias’s drug use on particular occasions. The District Court properly held that rebuttal testimony either must come from persons familiar with the particular events to which the defendants’ witnesses testified or must otherwise cast more than metaphysical doubt on the credibility of that testimony. Bias’s parents and coach did not have personal knowledge of Bias’s activities at the sorts of parties and gatherings about which Long and Gregg testified. The drug test results offered by the Estate may show that Bias had no cocaine in his system on the dates when the tests were administered, but, as the District Court correctly noted, these tests speak only to Bias’s abstention during the periods preceding the tests. The tests do not rebut the <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="586" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page586">p. 586</span>Long and Gregg testimony that on a number of occasions Bias ingested cocaine in their presence.</p>
<p id="c0d820a2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Estate could have deposed Long and Gregg, or otherwise attempted to impeach their testimony. The Estate also could have offered the testimony of other friends or teammates of Bias who were present at some of the gatherings described by Long and Gregg, who went out with Bias frequently, or who were otherwise familiar with his social habits. The Estate did none of these things. The Estate is not entitled to reach the jury merely on the supposition that the jury might not believe the defendants’ witnesses. We thus agree with the District Court that there was no genuine issue of fact concerning Bias’s status as a cocaine user.</p>

<p id="c0d820a4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendants offered evidence that <i>every</i> insurance company inquires about the prior drug use of an applicant for a jumbo policy at <i>some point</i> in the application process. . . . The Estate’s evidence that some insurance companies existed in 1986 which did not inquire about prior drug use at certain particular stages in the application process does not undermine the defendant’s claim that at <i>some</i> point in the process <i>every</i> insurance company did inquire about drug use, particularly where a jumbo policy was involved. The Estate failed to name a single particular company or provide other evidence that a single company existed which would have issued a jumbo policy in 1986 without inquiring about the applicant’s drug use. Because the Estate has failed to do more than show that there is “some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts,” <i>Matsushita Elec.</i>, the District Court properly concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to the insurability of a drug user. . . . </p>
<p id="c0d820a5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In order to withstand a summary judgment motion once the moving party has made a prima facie showing to support its claims, the nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e). The Estate has failed to come forward with such facts in this case, relying instead on bare arguments and allegations or on evidence which does not actually create a genuine issue for trial. For this reason, we affirm the District Court’s award of summary judgment to the defendants in this case.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0d846be-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff in <i>Bias</i> obviously took the latter course. Explain why that was almost certainly the right move to make, even though it did not succeed.</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0d846c0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The best demonstration of what constitutes a “genuine dispute as to [a] material fact,” as well as of how close the decision in <i>Bias</i> comes to the line, emerges if we think about some variations on the facts of the case. Start by supposing that the sole evidence of drug use presented by the defendants was the testimony of Bias’s friends, who said under oath that they had on several specific dates seen Bias use cocaine. Further suppose that plaintiff had presented evidence of other persons, present at the same times, who unequivocally testified that they had been in Bias’s company the whole time and that he had not used drugs. Explain why summary judgment would not be appropriate.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d846c1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now come closer to the actual case, in which there was testimony that Bias had ingested cocaine on specific dates and that he had provided drugs for others; there was also evidence (the negative drug tests) that he had been drug-free on other days, and that close associates and family did not believe him to have used drugs. Why does this state of evidence not create a similar conflict for a trier of fact to resolve?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d846c2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court’s answer to that question is that the evidence of drug use was specific, while the evidence of non-use was general, and that the specific trumps the general—such that there really isn’t a conflict for the trier to resolve. Suppose that Bias had died when he was struck by a car while crossing the street. Under those circumstances if the defendants had moved for summary judgment by introducing evidence of drug use and arguing that he would not have been able to obtain a life insurance policy, do you suppose the case would have come out the same way? Or would plaintiff have been able to argue, first, that, at worst, defendants’ evidence showed occasional exposure to the drug and, second, that the defendants were trying to avoid their own breach of contract by posthumously smearing the name of a great African-American athlete? Moreover, the defendants were doing so with the testimony of persons who, by their own account, were habitual drug users; shouldn’t Bias’s estate be able to put them on the stand before a jury and probe their veracity?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d846c3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the real world, we know that Bias did not die in a car accident, but from a drug overdose. Is the court, without explicitly saying so, inferring from the cocaine-related death that Bias must have been a <i>habitual</i> user, that drugs would inevitably have showed up in any insurance physical, and that he was therefore uninsurable? If so, are such inferences permissible?</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c0d846c5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are told that Bias was given “several” drug tests, all of which were negative. The court says that this demonstrates only that Bias had not used drugs recently on the days the tests were given and that is not enough to overcome specific testimony by the associates of drug use. But suppose the tests had been administered randomly, some of them in the same months where the other witnesses testified to drug use. Would that be enough to cast doubt on the picture of habitual drug use? Recall that the question on summary judgment is whether there is an issue of fact to try.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0d86dd6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are also told that plaintiff’s counsel did not depose the two friends who testified as to Bias’s drug use or attack their credibility. What sort of deposition questions might have shed enough doubt on their credibility to create a triable issue of fact? What if they admitted that they felt Bias’s parents had mistreated and taken advantage of Bias, and that they didn’t like the parents and would be happy if the parents lost the suit?

<p id="c0d8bc17-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q3.</b>  A and C are the correct responses. A is correct because the Federal Arbitration Act, which governs arbitration agreements, preempts state law, providing that arbitration agreements may be avoided only on grounds applicable to <i>all</i> contracts; this statute, which singles out arbitration in employment agreements, fails the test of being generally applicable to all contracts. C is correct for the converse reason: If this agreement fails under the state’s general law of unconscionability, courts may refuse to enforce it, but not otherwise. B is wrong for the same reasons listed under A. D is wrong because the FAA governs all agreements to arbitrate involving “commerce,” which has been very broadly interpreted—including state law claims.</p>
<p id="c0d8bc18-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q4.</b>  A and B are correct. They are correct because the <i>plaintiff</i> has the burden of production on the question of causation, and if the evidence to date hasn’t yielded such evidence, after <i>Celotex</i> defendant wins on this showing. B is correct because the burdens of production are reversed: <i>Defendant</i> has the burden of production on an affirmative defense and can prevail only by making a positive showing that the statute has run. C is wrong because A and B are correct.</p>
<p id="c0d8bc19-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q5.</b>  A and C are correct. A is correct because <i>Celotex</i> tells judges to view the evidence presented as of the time of summary judgment and to grant summary judgment if the party with the burden of production has not collected and presented enough evidence to allow a rational trier of fact to find in its favor. That instruction tells parties with the burden of production that they must be able to present such a collection of evidence at the moment of summary judgment—and thus makes it critical to deploy available discovery tools to gather that evidence. C is correct because <i>Anderson</i> tells us so—at summary judgment, evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="591" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page591">p. 591</span>party. The district court and Fifth Circuit did not do so in <i>Tolan v. Cotton</i> and were reversed as a result. B is incorrect because the party opposing summary judgment has not avoided judgment simply by presenting evidence in her opposition. Instead, that evidence must create a material factual dispute. In the <i>Bias</i> case, both sides did offer evidence supporting their claims, but the court found that the information offered by the plaintiff in opposition to defendants’ summary judgment motion did not create a factual dispute.</p><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="592" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page592">p. 592</span>

Parties to arbitration are often charged two or three thousand dollars per day in arbitration “forum fees,” since arbitrators typically charge $300-400 per hour. We are concerned by the significant deterrent effect that such fees will have on employees who are required to arbitrate their civil rights claims. [In a subsequent footnote, the court added: “Our conclusion that Countrywide’s fee provision is unconscionable is not affected by the fact that, under Countrywide’s arbitration agreement, ’the arbitrator may in his or her discretion permit the prevailing party to recover fees and costs.’ As is clear on its face, this provision is <i>discretionary</i> and, therefore, there is no guarantee that the prevailing party will, in fact, recover fees. Moreover, the significant up-front costs associated with bringing a claim in an arbitral forum may prevent individuals with meritorious claims from even pursuing these claims in the first place."]</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c0d6e7b1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="#ftN10A84_d543d88d-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" id="note-N10A84_d543d88d-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">6</a></span>&nbsp;[The quoted language constituted the text of Rule 56 at the time <i>Adickes</i> was decided.

<div class="cc-section epub-section epub-anyhead" id="c0deaf8a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">
<p id="c0ded69b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We now come to the only part of civil procedure about which you thought you knew something before starting law school. Trials are a familiar part of our general social knowledge. They have been the stuff of drama for centuries, and of the scriptures of several religious traditions for millennia. In this tradition, trial, the culminating moment of every lawsuit, brings truth to light as witnesses blurt out surprising statements, or juries do justice in the face of apparently overwhelming adverse evidence. And when the verdict arrives, the case is over: Victors beam, losers slink away.</p>
<p id="c0ded69c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unfortunately, most of that knowledge turns out to be wrong. First: Despite the ubiquity of trials in books and movies, there are at present very few trials in real life. As you have already gathered from earlier chapters, in the federal courts fewer than 2 percent of civil cases reach this point; in state courts the proportion is somewhat higher, but still small. Second, when civil cases do get to trial, they look very little like the edge-of-the-seat versions you read about and watch. Instead, there are few surprises and little drama, at least if lawyers have conducted appropriate discovery. In well-prepared civil litigation both sides will know what every witness or document will say, and if a witness’s testimony varies from that given in deposition, he will be promptly impeached with prior sworn testimony. Dramatic revelations, if they occur, may even provide the basis for a new trial, at least if the information disclosed at trial was sought by one of the parties but not revealed in discovery. The parties may not know how the case will be decided, but they will know well the conflicting versions of the story. This phase of litigation differs from popular <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="594" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page594">p. 594</span>depictions for a third reason: Trial is not the end of the saga, or at least not always. As we will see in the next chapter, there may well be an appeal, but even if there is not, there will certainly be post-verdict motions for judgment as a matter of law or, alternatively, for a new trial.</p>
<p id="c0ded69d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why, then, study a rare and usually dull intermediate stage of civil litigation? First, trials, rare though they have come to be, shape almost every aspect of procedure. The elaborate provisions for discovery have as one of their primary goals the uncovering of information to be presented at trial. Much of the law of evidence is aimed at controlling the flow of information during trial. Likewise, the emphasis on the presentation of live witnesses (rather than depositions or other documentary evidence)—which brings with it the opportunity for theatrical displays by lawyers—stems from a conception of the trial as the culmination of litigation. Even the adversarial stance of the lawyers—perhaps more marked in Anglo-American law than in other systems—may flow in part from the realization that the whole case rides on a single presentation in a comparatively short time span before a judge or jury.</p>
<p id="c0ded69e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, although trials do not display the kind of drama that you have come to expect, there is, nevertheless, a certain kind of drama in trials. But the drama goes on behind the scenes, as the parties battle over which judge and which jurors should be allowed to decide the case, what they should be allowed to hear, and whether the judge’s or jurors’ decision should be allowed to stand. This chapter goes behind the scenes to examine the actors in these concealed struggles for power that can make all the difference in the outcome of the case.</p>
<p id="c0ded69f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This chapter will tackle the topic by asking (and answering) just two questions: <i>Who</i> will decide the case? (Sections A and B, dealing with choosing judges and juries); and <i>How</i> will they decide the case? (Sections C-G, about the procedures that shape trial). We begin with who.</p>
</div>
<div id="c0ded6a0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" level="A" class="epub-section epub-ahead cc-section"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-xlarge left"><h2><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0ded6a1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">A.&nbsp;CHOOSING AND CHALLENGING JUDGES</p></h2></div>


<p id="c0ded6a2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether or not there will be a jury in your case, there will be a judge. That judge may rule on whether you are entitled to a jury. And if you are entitled to a jury, that judge will rule on your challenges to the jury pool and individual jurors. And long before you get to the trial stage, that judge—in almost all federal courts and in many state courts—will have likely ruled on various aspects of the litigation, from the sufficiency of pleadings to motions to dismiss to discovery disputes and summary judgment motions. So a great deal turns on the wisdom, knowledge, fairness, and diligence of the judge. Litigators will tell you that, next to the merits of the case, the identity of the judge is the most important factor in predicting the outcome of the case.</p>
<p id="c0ded6a3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How do judges get to be judges? Broadly speaking, they get to their offices in one of two ways: by appointment or by election. Federal judges are nominated by the President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate; once appointed they can be removed only by impeachment. Most state judges owe their initial place on the <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="595" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page595">p. 595</span>bench to gubernatorial appointment. Thereafter they are subject to occasional electoral exposure, sometimes by facing a challenge in a reconfirmation election. A minority of state judges will first take the bench as a winner of an electoral contest. These elections are usually nonpartisan, but in some states judges run as candidates of a given political party. Both the appointive and the electoral process leave their imprints.</p>
<p id="c0ded6a4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Let’s start with the imprint of a President, governor, or other appointing authority. Though these executives may have run on a platform promising to appoint judges of a certain cast of mind, all will want to appoint judges who will not embarrass them. That means a very thorough background check, which will be devoted partly to ascertaining the skill, professional standing, and reputation of the nominee, and partly to looking into nooks and crannies of her past with an eye to discovering anything that might block her confirmation or cast the appointing authority in a bad light. Electoral contests may also turn up such information—and may pressure the judicial candidate to take positions on issues of concern to the voters. If the judge has to face voters in a reconfirmation election, she may also be wary about rulings that will be unpopular or easily mischaracterized by opponents. That is not to say that judges will not make such rulings—they do every day—but it is to say that the consequences of such a ruling may lurk in the back of the judicial mind.</p>
<p id="c0ded6a5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Beyond these features lie those of background. Almost all judges will be trained as lawyers; only a few states do not require lower judicial officers (magistrates or justices of the peace) to have legal training. Judges will thus bring with them to the bench all the knowledge and habits of thought such training implies; even at this early stage of your career you are likely learning that lawyers think about many matters differently than nonlawyers. And because they have half a career as lawyers behind them, judges will not likely have had significant experience in ballet dancing, heavy construction, cab-driving, or elementary school teaching and therefore lack the knowledge and sense of the world that each of these occupations might bring. Moreover, they are distinguished even from the million or so people in the United States who are licensed to practice law: They belong to the subset of about 20,000 who hold judicial offices.</p>
<p id="c0ded6a6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Such professional training helps keep judges focused on factors the law defines as legally relevant, but judges are human, and humans are fallible. How does the system seek to protect litigants against biased judges? There are two answers to that question: judicial discipline and recusal.</p>
<p id="c0ded6a7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most states and the federal judiciary have procedures for disciplining judges who, though unbiased, fail to comply with the Judicial Canons of Ethics. States have various mechanisms for receiving, investigating, and acting upon complaints against state judges. In the federal judiciary, 28 U.S.C. §§351 et seq. permits persons to file complaints against judges, and requires the chief judge of each circuit to investigate the charges and to take various actions—including dismissal of the complaint, a declaration that the judge in question is disabled, censure or reprimand, and referral of the case to the House of Representatives for impeachment proceedings. But violation of the Canons, while perhaps cause for complaint and discipline against a judge, does not remove that judge from your particular case. Only recusal does that.</p>
<p id="c0defdb8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="596" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page596">p. 596</span>There are two forms of recusal: peremptory and for cause. About a third of the states, mostly midwestern and western, permit peremptory challenges of judges. A party wishing to make such a challenge simply files a timely affidavit alleging in conclusory terms that the judge is prejudiced against the party. James Sample, David Posen &amp; Michael Young, Fair Courts: Setting Recusal Standards 8 (Brennan Center for Justice 2008). Actual prejudice need not be shown, but each side gets only one such challenge. The words of one federal statute, 28 U.S.C. §144, appear to require peremptory recusal in the federal courts,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10066_d543ff9e-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10066_d543ff9e-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*1</a></span> but the Supreme Court has interpreted that statute to require cause.</p>
<p id="c0defdba-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What cause might look like is defined in 28 U.S.C. §455, which closely tracks the ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct, a code likewise echoed by most state recusal statutes. Section 455 establishes two broad categories for disqualifying a judge. One contains specific guidelines barring, for example, a judge’s hearing a case “where he has served as lawyer in the matter in controversy” before becoming a judge or “[w]here he has served in governmental employment and. . . . expressed an opinion concerning the merits of the particular case or controversy.” It also bars decisions in cases in which a judge or her family has a financial interest. 28 U.S.C. §455(b). The other category is much broader: “Any justice, judge, or magistrate of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.” 28 U.S.C. §455(a). As a build-up to the case law, use the following problems to familiarize yourself with the statute.</p>

<p id="c0df24db-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia reversed a trial court judgment, which had entered a jury verdict of $50 million. Five justices heard the case, and the vote to reverse was 3 to 2.

Massey Coal Co. and its affiliates (hereinafter Massey) liable for fraudulent misrepresentation, concealment, and tortious interference with existing contractual relations. The jury awarded petitioners Hugh Caperton. . . . (hereinafter Caperton) the sum of $50 million in compensatory and punitive damages. . . . </p>
<p id="c0df24df-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Don Blankenship is Massey’s chairman, chief executive officer, and president. After the verdict but before the appeal, West Virginia held its 2004 judicial elections. Knowing the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia would consider the appeal in the case, Blankenship decided to support an attorney who sought to replace Justice McGraw[,] a candidate for reelection to that court. The attorney who sought to replace him was Brent Benjamin.</p>
<p id="c0df24e0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to contributing the $1,000 statutory maximum to Benjamin’s campaign committee, Blankenship donated almost $2.5 million to “And For The Sake Of The Kids,” a political organization formed under 26 U.S.C. §527[, a section of the Internal Revenue Code permitting tax-exempt political organizations]. The §527 organization opposed McGraw and supported Benjamin. Blankenship’s donations accounted for more than two-thirds of the total funds it raised. This was not all. Blankenship spent, in addition, just over $500,000 on independent expenditures—for direct mailings and letters soliciting donations as well as television and newspaper advertisements—"’to support. . . . Brent Benjamin.’”</p>
<p id="c0df24e1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To provide some perspective, Blankenship’s $3 million in contributions were more than the total amount spent by all other Benjamin supporters and three times the amount spent by Benjamin’s own committee.

Justice Benjamin denied the motion [at several points in the litigation, before casting the decisive vote against Caperton in a 3-2 decision reversing the $50 million verdict against Massey. He also delivered an opinion stating] that he [had] “carefully considered the bases and accompanying exhibits proffered by the movants.” But he found “no objective information. . . . to <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="599" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page599">p. 599</span>show that this Justice has a bias for or against any litigant, that this Justice has prejudged the matters which comprise this litigation, or that this Justice will be anything but fair and impartial”. . . . [and] that he had no “’direct, personal, substantial, pecuniary interest’ in this case.” Adopting “a standard merely of ’appearances,’” he concluded, “seems little more than an invitation to subject West Virginia’s justice system to the vagaries of the day—a framework in which predictability and stability yield to supposition, innuendo, half-truths, and partisan manipulations.”</p>

<p id="c0df4bf6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is axiomatic that “[a] fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process.” As the Court has recognized, however, “most matters relating to judicial disqualification [do] not rise to a constitutional level.” The early and leading case on the subject is Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U.S. 510 (1927). There, the Court stated that “matters of kinship, personal bias, state policy, remoteness of interest, would seem generally to be matters merely of legislative discretion.”</p>
<p id="c0df4bf7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Tumey</i> Court concluded that the Due Process Clause incorporated the common-law rule that a judge must recuse himself when he has “a direct, personal, substantial, pecuniary interest” in a case. This rule reflects the maxim that “[n]o man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause; because his interest would certainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably, corrupt his integrity.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c0df4bf8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As new problems have emerged that were not discussed at common law, however, the Court has identified additional instances which, as an objective matter, require recusal. These are circumstances “in which experience teaches that the probability of actual bias on the part of the judge or decisionmaker is too high to be constitutionally tolerable.” To place the present case in proper context, two instances where the Court has required recusal merit further discussion.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">
<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0df4bf9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">A</p></div>
<p id="c0df4bfa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first involved the emergence of local tribunals where a judge had a financial interest in the outcome of a case, although the interest was less than what would have been considered personal or direct at common law.</p>
<p id="c0df4bfb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This was the problem addressed in <i>Tumey</i>. There, the mayor of a village had the authority to sit as a judge (with no jury) to try those accused of violating a state law prohibiting the possession of alcoholic beverages. Inherent in this structure were two potential conflicts. First, the mayor received a salary supplement for performing judicial duties, and the funds for that compensation derived from the fines assessed in a case. No fines were assessed upon acquittal. The mayor-judge thus received a salary supplement only if he convicted the defendant. Second, sums from the criminal fines were deposited to the village’s general treasury fund for village improvements and repairs.</p>
<p id="c0df4bfc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court held that the Due Process Clause required disqualification. . . . </p>
<p id="c0df4bfd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This concern with conflicts resulting from financial incentives was elaborated in Ward v. Monroeville, 409 U.S. 57 (1972), which invalidated a conviction in another mayor’s court. In <i>Monroeville</i>, unlike in <i>Tumey</i>, the mayor received no money; instead, <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="600" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page600">p. 600</span>the fines the mayor assessed went to the town’s general fisc. The Court held that “[t]he fact that the mayor [in <i>Tumey</i>] shared directly in the fees and costs did not define the limits of the principle.” The principle, instead, turned on the “’possible temptation’” the mayor might face; the mayor’s “executive responsibilities for village finances may make him partisan to maintain the high level of contribution [to those finances] from the mayor’s court.” As the Court reiterated in another case that Term, “the [judge’s] financial stake need not be as direct or positive as it appeared to be in <i>Tumey</i>.”  . . . </p>
<p id="c0df4bfe-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[In another case] the Court stressed that it was “not required to decide whether in fact [the justice] was influenced.” The proper constitutional inquiry is “whether sitting on the case then before the Supreme Court of Alabama “would offer a possible temptation to the average. . . . judge to. . . . lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and true.” The Court underscored that “what degree or kind of interest is sufficient to disqualify a judge from sitting ’cannot be defined with precision.’” In the Court’s view, however, it was important that the test have an objective component.</p>

<p id="c0df4c00-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second instance requiring recusal that was not discussed at common law emerged in the criminal contempt context, where a judge had no pecuniary interest in the case but was challenged because of a conflict arising from his participation in an earlier proceeding. This Court characterized that first proceeding (perhaps pejoratively) as a “’one-man grand jury.’”</p>
<p id="c0df4c01-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In that first proceeding, and as provided by state law, a judge examined witnesses to determine whether criminal charges should be brought. The judge called the two petitioners before him. One petitioner answered questions, but the judge found him untruthful and charged him with perjury. The second declined to answer on the ground that he did not have counsel with him, as state law seemed to permit. The judge charged him with contempt. The judge proceeded to try and convict both petitioners.</p>
<p id="c0df7312-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court set aside the convictions on grounds that the judge had a conflict of interest at the trial stage because of his earlier participation followed by his decision to charge them. The Due Process Clause required disqualification. The Court recited the general rule that “no man can be a judge in his own case,” adding that “no man is permitted to try cases where he has an interest in the outcome.” It noted that the disqualifying criteria “cannot be defined with precision. Circumstances and relationships must be considered.” These circumstances and the prior relationship required recusal: “Having been a part of [the one-man grand jury] process a judge cannot be, in the very nature of things, wholly disinterested in the conviction or acquittal of those accused.” That is because “[a]s a practical matter it is difficult if not impossible for a judge to free himself from the influence of what took place in his ’grand-jury’ secret session.”  . . . </p>

<p id="c0df7314-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Based on the principles described in these cases we turn to the issue before us. This problem arises in the context of judicial elections, a framework not presented in the precedents we have reviewed and discussed.</p>
<p id="c0df7315-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="601" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page601">p. 601</span>Caperton contends that Blankenship’s pivotal role in getting Justice Benjamin elected created a constitutionally intolerable probability of actual bias. Though not a bribe or criminal influence, Justice Benjamin would nevertheless feel a debt of gratitude to Blankenship for his extraordinary efforts to get him elected. That temptation, Caperton claims, is as strong and inherent in human nature as was the conflict the Court confronted. . . . when a mayor-judge (or the city) benefited financially from a defendant’s conviction, as well as the conflict identified. . . . when a judge was the object of a defendant’s contempt.</p>
<p id="c0df7316-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Benjamin was careful to address the recusal motions and explain his reasons why, on his view of the controlling standard, disqualification was not in order. In four separate opinions issued during the course of the appeal, he explained why no actual bias had been established. He found no basis for recusal because Caperton failed to provide “objective evidence” or “objective information,” but merely “subjective belief” of bias. Nor could anyone “point to any actual conduct or activity on [his] part which could be termed ’improper.’” In other words, based on the facts presented by Caperton, Justice Benjamin conducted a probing search into his actual motives and inclinations; and he found none to be improper. We do not question his subjective findings of impartiality and propriety. Nor do we determine whether there was actual bias. . . . </p>
<p id="c0df7317-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The difficulties of inquiring into actual bias, and the fact that the inquiry is often a private one, simply underscore the need for objective rules. Otherwise there may be no adequate protection against a judge who simply misreads or misapprehends the real motives at work in deciding the case. The judge’s own inquiry into actual bias, then, is not one that the law can easily superintend or review, though actual bias, if disclosed, no doubt would be grounds for appropriate relief. In lieu of exclusive reliance on that personal inquiry, or on appellate review of the judge’s determination respecting actual bias, the Due Process Clause has been implemented by objective standards that do not require proof of actual bias. In defining these standards the Court has asked whether, “under a realistic appraisal of psychological tendencies and human weakness,” the interest “poses such a risk of actual bias or prejudgment that the practice must be forbidden if the guarantee of due process is to be adequately implemented.”</p>
<p id="c0df7318-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We turn to the influence at issue in this case. Not every campaign contribution by a litigant or attorney creates a probability of bias that requires a judge’s recusal, but this is an exceptional case. We conclude that there is a serious risk of actual bias—based on objective and reasonable perceptions—when a person with a personal stake in a particular case had a significant and disproportionate influence in placing the judge on the case by raising funds or directing the judge’s election campaign when the case was pending or imminent. The inquiry centers on the contribution’s relative size in comparison to the total amount of money contributed to the campaign, the total amount spent in the election, and the apparent effect such contribution had on the outcome of the election. . . . </p>
<p id="c0df7319-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether Blankenship’s campaign contributions were a necessary and sufficient cause of Benjamin’s victory is not the proper inquiry. Much like determining whether a judge is actually biased, proving what ultimately drives the electorate to choose a particular candidate is a difficult endeavor, not likely to lend itself to a certain <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="602" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page602">p. 602</span>conclusion. This is particularly true where, as here, there is no procedure for judicial factfinding and the sole trier of fact is the one accused of bias. Due process requires an objective inquiry into whether the contributor’s influence on the election under all the circumstances “would offer a possible temptation to the average. . . . judge to. . . . lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and true.” . . . </p>
<p id="c0df731a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Benjamin did undertake an extensive search for actual bias. But, as we have indicated, that is just one step in the judicial process; objective standards may also require recusal whether or not actual bias exists or can be proved. Due process “may sometimes bar trial by judges who have no actual bias and who would do their very best to weigh the scales of justice equally between contending parties.” The failure to consider objective standards requiring recusal is not consistent with the imperatives of due process. We find that Blankenship’s significant and disproportionate influence—coupled with the temporal relationship between the election and the pending case—"offer a possible temptation to the average. . . . judge to. . . . lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and true.” On these extreme facts the probability of actual bias rises to an unconstitutional level.</p>

Thirty-two years later, Ronald Castille had been elected to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, when Williams’s post-conviction appeal came before that tribunal. The substantive issue was whether one of Castille’s prosecutors had improperly withheld exculpatory evidence from the defense. When that question came before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, Williams’s lawyers asked that Justice Castille recuse himself; he declined and voted to deny Williams’s petition. The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5-3 decision (a seat was vacant) reversed, citing <i>Caperton</i> for the proposition that because Justice Castille had a “significant, personal involvement” in the underlying case, due process compelled him to recuse himself.</p></li>

If the judge’s ruling creates a final judgment, the loser can appeal. If it does not, the loser can reconsider settlement (now at a less attractive value) or hunker down to wait for the end. With a jury, matters are different: There is now another source of power in the room, a source to whom both parties can speak. They can speak only of certain matters and only in certain ways, matters and ways the judge controls. But the existence of the jury changes everything—from lawyers’ propensity to speak in jargon and shorthand, to their calculations of ultimate success. Experienced lawyers will say that some cases are winnable only with a jury. Good empirical research tells us, however, that juries are not pushovers, and judges not stern deniers: Plaintiffs prevail in only half of the tort cases that go to a jury trial, and in some cases judges are more likely than juries to award high damages.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN102C3_d543ff9e-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N102C3_d543ff9e-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*2</a></span></p>

Although we inherited the institution from English law, it is available there only in a few specialized cases (for example, in libel actions). But in the United States, civil jury trials are widely available in both state and federal courts. This availability results from provisions in state and the federal Constitutions granting the right to jury trial in certain cases. We will focus on the federal courts. In the debates attending the adoption of the federal Constitution in 1789 and the Bill of Rights in 1791, much attention was paid to the jury trial. Some opponents of the Constitution cited the omission of a civil jury trial provision (in the Constitution as it existed before the Bill of Rights) as an argument for not ratifying that document:</p>

<p id="c0e00f8e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The proponents of civil jury trial won an important battle: The Seventh Amendment became part of the Bill of Rights. They did not win the war, however, because the Amendment did not make all cases triable to a jury. Instead, it compromised between those who thought jury trial at best a nuisance, at worst an invitation to lawlessness, and those who thought it a vital structural and substantive principle of government. The compromise is embedded in the deceptively short text of the Seventh Amendment:<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10302_d543ff9e-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10302_d543ff9e-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*3</a></span></p>

<p id="c0e036a1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts and lawyers typically divide the Amendment into two roughly equal halves: the “right to jury trial” clause, comprising the text up through the word “preserved”; and the “reexamination” clause, comprising the rest of the Amendment. Both parts empower and limit the civil jury. We begin with the part of the Amendment granting the right to a civil jury.</p>
<p id="c0e036a2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first part of the Seventh Amendment reflects the great compromise in two phrases: “suits at common law” and “shall be preserved.” The Seventh Amendment purports to “preserve” a right but does not indicate the scope of the right being preserved. The English judicial system, whose organization was echoed by colonial courts in the period immediately before the Revolution, was divided into several jurisdictions. In courts of common law, jury trial was widely available on most of the writs commonly in use by the eighteenth century. A full list is not possible here, <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="608" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page608">p. 608</span>but some of the more common writs will give the student a flavor: trespass (with several subcategories); debt (to recover sums owed); covenant (to remedy breaches of written, sealed contracts); ejectment (to recover land unlawfully occupied); trover and replevin (to recover for unlawful takings of personal property); and assumpsit (meaning “he (or she) promised,” to recover for breaches of informal, usually oral, contracts).</p>
<p id="c0e036a3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In courts of chancery (which oversaw some important substantive areas, e.g., the law of trusts, and also administered various equitable remedies, e.g., injunctions), however, the judge (the chancellor) sat without a jury. The constitutional compromise, then, “preserved” as triable to a jury those cases that could have been brought in a court of common law. If, however, the claim would have fallen into the jurisdiction of the court of chancery, the Seventh Amendment did not extend the right to jury trial. Courts dealing with this issue distinguish between legal and equitable claims and remedies. By doing so, they are simply using a shorthand form of reference: “Legal” in this context means a claim recognized by a court of law (where juries sat), and “equitable” means that the claim or remedy would have been in chancery (where no juries sat).</p>
<p id="c0e036a4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Chapter 5, we noted the development of elaborate doctrine concerning which cases could be brought in equity. The result was that equity had exclusive jurisdiction over some substantive areas (trusts are a good example) and shared jurisdiction when plaintiffs sought remedies such as injunctions, specific performance, rescission, and accountings and procedural devices such as derivative suits, class actions, bills of peace, and bills of interpleader. A given plaintiff had to show either that equity had exclusive jurisdiction over, say, the law of trusts, or that the traditional legal remedy of money damages was inadequate and that plaintiff otherwise qualified for equitable relief. See <i>Lucy Webb Hayes Natl. Training School v. Geoghegan</i>, in Chapter 5 (page 308) for an example of a court administering an equitable remedy (injunction) on a common law claim (trespass).</p>
<p id="c0e036a5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Remember: Cases within equity jurisdiction did not wind up there because of anyone’s conviction that the judge was better suited than a jury to decide a particular type of claim. Although the judge may have been more qualified to sort out fiduciary relationships, probate matters, or multiparty actions, many other branches of equity jurisdiction involved the same questions of fact—what happened, how it happened, and who was telling the truth—as legal actions. For example, injunctive actions frequently involved questions of land ownership or commission of a tort, and specific performance claims usually involved the construction and meaning of contracts. Moreover, as time went on, distinctions between the two jurisdictions blurred even further: Legal claims in general assumpsit (money had and received) tended to parallel equitable remedies for restitution, and traditionally equitable defenses such as fraud, duress, and illegality came to be recognized at law. As a result, the law-equity jurisdictional distinction was far from hard and fast, and whatever distinction existed was more a result of history than of logic or function.</p>
<p id="c0e036a6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given the constitutional language “preserving” the right to a jury trial for suits at “common law,” it is not surprising that the courts have adopted a historical test for deciding the right to jury trial under the Seventh Amendment. Under the historical test, courts seek to give parties the same right of jury trial as they had in <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="609" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page609">p. 609</span>1791. Presumably, the drafters of the Seventh Amendment were thinking of a world in which there were separate courts of law and equity, a world in which one could only “preserve” a right to jury trial in suits at common law. Because there had never been a right to jury trial in equity, there was nothing to preserve and no right to jury trial.</p>
<p id="c0e036a7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consequently, courts applying the historical test do not directly inquire about jury trial. Instead, they ask a related question: whether a given claim and remedy lay within the jurisdiction of the common law courts in 1791. If so, the parties have the right to a jury; if not—if only a court of equity would have heard the claim or administered that remedy—there is no right to a jury. Equitable jurisdiction generally turned on whether the plaintiff wanted injunctive or other relief available only in equity, wanted to use a procedural device that was available only in equity, or had a claim that could be brought only in equity. Before you despair of sorting all this out, be comforted by the thought that a very large portion of claims fit neatly into well-established historical patterns. Having mastered that pattern, you will have answers for the great majority of jury trial questions you will ever encounter.</p>
<p id="c0e036a8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, note that the U.S. Supreme Court has never held that the Seventh Amendment applies to the states—which are therefore free to decide the right to jury trial in civil cases without recourse to the U.S. Constitution.</p>

<p id="c0e05dbe-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When deciding whether long-standing types of claims are legal or equitable, one must assess whether, in 1791, the claim would have been brought in a court of law or in a court of equity. That may require refreshing one’s historical memory, but it presents no conceptual difficulties.</p>
<p id="c0e05dbf-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="610" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page610">p. 610</span>Knottier problems emerge when one considers claims that did not exist at the time the Bill of Rights was adopted, often those created by statute. In a series of cases the Supreme Court has said that when facing such a case, the court should first try to locate the closest historical analogy. Thus, in a case involving union members’ right to fair representation by their union—a claim that could not have existed in 1791 because unions were illegal—the Court examined analogies to a malpractice action against one’s lawyer (which would have been a legal claim triable to a jury), a motion to vacate an arbitration order (equitable; no jury), and an action by the beneficiary of a trust against the trustee for breach of fiduciary duty (equitable; no jury). Chauffeurs, Teamsters, &amp; Helpers, Local No. 391 v. Terry, 494 U.S. 558 (1990). Finding no analogy close enough to satisfy it entirely, the majority then took a second, tie-breaking step, to look at the remedy sought in the case, money damages, and decided that it most resembled the remedy typical in legal claims triable to a jury, and that a jury was thus required. A concurring opinion complained that the Court was not at its best when “rattling through the dusty attics of ancient writs.” A dissent, by contrast, thought that the Court had discovered just the right analogue in that attic (the suit by the beneficiary of a trust) and that the Court should have stopped there and denied a jury trial. Again, recall that for the vast majority of claims the question of the right to trial by jury will be well established either in federal courts, which apply the Seventh Amendment, or in state courts, which apply their own constitutions and statutes.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0e05dc6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In many instances, state courts have proved substantially less enthusiastic about jury trials in civil cases than have the federal courts. As examples of cases in which state courts rejected claims of entitlement to a jury, consider C&amp;K Engineering Contractors v. Amber Steel Co., 23 Cal. 3d 1 (1978) (contract actions based on promissory estoppel); Strauss v. Summerhays, 157 Cal. App. 3d 806 (1984) (quiet-title actions); Robair v. Dahl, 80 Mich.

<li class=""><p id="c0e05dc7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why have state courts embraced the civil jury less warmly than the federal courts have? Two possibilities—one political, one practical—come to mind. First, the history of the Seventh Amendment, whose absence was thought by some to be so important as nearly to scuttle the ratification of the federal Constitution, might cause the federal courts to err on the side of the jury when in doubt. There was no equivalent controversy in most state constitutional debates: Civil juries were taken to be a matter of course. Second, federal courts can more easily absorb the costs of additional jury trials; federal courts are generally better financed than their state counterparts. Every time a state court creates a new right to civil jury trial, it is adding a strain on court budgets.</p></li>

<p id="c0e084d8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">New claims create one set of jury trial problems for litigants and courts. Changing procedures creates another. At the time of the Seventh Amendment there were separate courts of law and equity. If a litigant needed relief from both (for example, first the reformation of a contract, then suit for damages on the reformed agreement), he would have to file two suits. Moreover, a good deal of adversarial jockeying could arise, with one party seeking remedies at law while the other sought equitable relief. In such cases, which court took precedence?</p>
<p id="c0e084d9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Federal Rules merged law and equity. Rules 1 and 2. Claims that were formerly legal or equitable could now be pleaded in the same suit, and the courts were given little guidance as to when a jury trial was required in a merged procedure. The constitutional right to jury trial still applied. The trouble was that the right that was “preserved” came from a system that no longer existed—that is, the right was preserved but the underlying procedural system was not. There was no particular difficulty in applying the historical approach to actions that could be denominated as clearly legal or equitable. For example, the typical personal injury suit was cognizable at law, and a suit seeking only injunctive relief was cognizable in equity. In such cases, a jury trial was granted or denied in accordance with the pre-merger practice.</p>

Some examples might be helpful:</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0e084db-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff joins legal and equitable claims. For example, plaintiff might sue to enjoin a nuisance and simultaneously seek damages for past harm.</p></li>

</ol>
<p id="c0e084de-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notice that in each of these situations the legal and equitable phases of the case had common issues: For example, did the defendant’s behavior constitute a nuisance? The merger of law and equity forced courts to think about jury trial in situations such as these with little guidance from the rulemakers who had preserved the right but destroyed the system.</p>
<p id="c0e084df-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has offered a clear answer—though it rests on shaky historical and logical grounds. When a case blends equitable and legal claims—<i>and</i> there are overlapping factual issues—the judge should defer to the jury. He can do so by holding the equitable claims in abeyance until the jury renders its verdict. (If the equitable claims are pressing, the judge can grant a preliminary injunction, revisiting the matter in the light of the jury’s verdict.) Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500 (1959); Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, 369 U.S. 469 (1962); see also Amoco Oil Co. v. Torcomian, 722 F.2d 1099 (3d Cir. 1983).</p>

<p id="c0e084e7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have looked at how judges are selected and challenged; we now turn to jurors. The battle over whether there will be a jury assumes that the jury—as an <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="613" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page613">p. 613</span>institution—matters. In part that is true because jurors typically won’t look or think like judges. Part of the reason lies in the number of jurors: Groups make decisions differently than individuals do. And laypeople, drafted for temporary service, will see things differently than professionals for whom this is “another malpractice case” rather than a rare exposure to litigation. One sees these assumptions at work in the processes by which jurors are selected.</p>
<p id="c0e084e8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Jurors are selected in ways that contrast sharply with the selection of judges. At common law, the sheriff was given very wide discretion in summoning jurors, and it was understood that he would summon people with both feet firmly planted in the established order. A medieval sheriff would have greeted the idea of a jury reflecting a demographic cross section first with incomprehension, then with horror. That outlook long prevailed. Not long ago, racial minorities, women, and members of the working class were often omitted from juries. The past 50 years have seen vast changes in these practices, both in the states and in the federal system. It is unconstitutional to discriminate on the basis of race or gender in compiling the list from which jurors are summoned. Most jurisdictions go further by statutorily requiring jury selection pools that represent broad cross sections of the community. The federal courts’ policy about jury pools appears at 28 U.S.C. §1861: “[L]itigants. . . . entitled to trial by jury shall have the right to. . . . juries selected at random from a fair cross section of the community.  . . . ”</p>
<p id="c0e0abf9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A persistent piece of lawyers’ lore—a view sometimes expressed in press accounts of juries—is that juries, unlike judges, are more easily fooled, swayed by emotion, or otherwise likely to decide a case on the basis of something other than the evidence. Empirical studies cast doubt on this perception. One careful study concluded:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0e0abfa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Indeed, one of the more remarkable lessons that empirical study has to offer the law is that virtually no evidence exists to support the prevailing ingrained intuitions about juries.

<p id="c0e0abfd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A trial jury is the result of a process involving several steps: defining a jury pool, assembling from that pool a subset of prospective jurors to hear the case (sometimes called an “array"), then from that array selecting the actual jury, which emerges from voir dire after lawyers have been permitted to challenge jurors peremptorily and for cause.</p>
<p id="c0e0abfe-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To assemble a pool of prospective jurors, one has to decide whom to call to the courthouse.

For example, summoning jurors exclusively from voters’ rolls, lists of Social Security recipients, auto registrations, welfare lists, or college registration rolls would yield juries with substantially different characteristics. The manner in which the federal courts create cross-sectional summonses appear at 28 U.S.C. §§1863-1864 and §1866. The method for challenging a jury pool appears at 28 U.S.C. §1867(c). Notice that the federal statute, and most state analogues, do not entitle litigants to an actual jury representing a demographic cross section; instead they require that the entire list of potential jurors—consisting of thousands or tens of thousands of names (depending on the size of the district from which they are drawn) have those cross-sectional characteristics. Moreover, challenges to the pool as a whole must be made long before the actual jury is selected.</p>
<p id="c0e0ac00-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At one time many jury service statutes categorically exempted large groups of people, ranging from police officers to mothers to physicians. In recent decades state and federal statutes have dramatically reduced these occupational exemptions. The current federal list exempts only active members of the armed services, public safety officers, and some public officials, including judges. Some state statutes exclude even fewer categories (including, for example, judges as potential jurors), though all statutes allow jurors to be excused for individual hardship. The result is that contemporary jury pools reflect a broad array of age, occupation, education, and wealth. As a consequence, challenges to jury pools—more common at times when many persons were categorically excluded from jury service—are now rare.</p>

From among these prospective jurors a certain number—perhaps 30 or 40 for a 12-person jury (fewer for a 6-person jury)—are randomly selected and sent to a particular courtroom. From those in the courtroom 6 or 12 are selected to sit in the jury box for initial questioning, a process called <i>voir dire</i>.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10434_d543ff9e-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10434_d543ff9e-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">5</a></span> This stage provides the parties a basis for exercising challenges to individual jurors.</p>
<p id="c0e0ac05-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The goal of voir dire is to identify unbiased jurors who can fairly hear and decide the case. Both the lawyers and the judge participate in the screening process. Typically, the judge will tell the parties a little bit about the case, identifying the parties and counsel and asking whether anyone on the jury panel is personally acquainted with or related to parties or counsel; if so, those jurors are excused. <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="615" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page615">p. 615</span>The judge then typically asks each member of the potential jury briefly to describe their area of residence, occupation, and that of their spouse or partner. This questioning lays the groundwork for additional questioning by the lawyers. Here practice varies widely: In most federal courts, the individual lawyers submit questions to the judge who screens them and asks those she thinks helpful. In some state courts, by contrast, the lawyers are given a free hand to engage in detailed questioning. No matter who asks these questions, the answers provide the lawyers with a basis for challenging jurors. For some challenges—those “for cause"—the lawyers explain their basis for thinking the juror unsuitable for this case. For other challenges—"peremptory” challenges—the lawyers need not supply a reason—though, as we shall see, in recent years the courts have developed rules designed to prevent peremptory challenges from being used in ways that discriminate on the basis of race or gender.</p>

The obvious one is to identify any bias against their client or her cause. The less obvious one is to begin to “educate” jurors about their client’s case—by asking questions that emphasize the points they will later make during the formal presentation of evidence. ("[Prospective juror] Jones, do you believe that when someone has been injured because of another’s negligence, she is entitled to full compensation for her injuries?"—from plaintiff’s lawyer. “Ms. Jones, do you believe that before someone is required to turn his hard-earned dollars over to another, that other should have to prove that her injuries were in fact caused by the defendant?"—from defendant’s counsel.) There are limits to lawyers’ ability to use voir dire in this way: The judge will step in if the efforts are blatant, but lawyers will often approach this line as closely as they can, figuring that the chance to make a good first impression during voir dire is too good to pass up.</p>
<p id="c0e0d319-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No statute defines the standards governing challenges for cause. A representative case describing the judicially developed principles stated:</p>

The district court must grant a challenge for cause, however, if a prospective juror shows actual prejudice or bias. Actual bias can be shown either by the juror’s own admission of bias or “by proof of specific facts which show the juror has such a close connection to the facts at trial that bias is presumed.”</p>

<p id="c0e0d31e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What if jurors conceal or lie on voir dire? The first question is how a lawyer would find out. Jurors answer the voir dire questions under oath, but there is no official investigation of their accuracy. Consequently, lawyers find out about anomalies mostly by chance. Once a lawyer determines that a juror was not candid during voir dire, what recourse does she have? Procedurally, the route is to move for a new trial; but when will one be granted? The leading case on that question, McDonough Power Equipment v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548 (1984), established the standard for challenging a verdict on the basis of inaccurate answers on voir dire:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0e0d31f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We hold that to obtain a new trial in such a situation, a party must first demonstrate that a juror <i>failed to answer honestly a material question</i> on voir dire, and then further show that <i>a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.</i></p>

<p id="c0e0d320-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Id. at 555 (emphasis added). Would you expect many verdicts to be upset under this standard?</p>
<p id="c0e0d321-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to an unlimited number of challenges for cause, parties are also permitted a limited number of peremptory challenges—challenges the party need not justify in any way. In civil cases in federal court (where the Rules provide that juries consist of 6 to 12 people), parties are entitled to three peremptory challenges. 28 U.S.C. §1870. States establish various numbers of peremptory challenges. What justifies peremptory challenges? One view is that peremptories in effect allow the parties to choose their juries, thus giving any ensuing verdict greater legitimacy in their eyes. A softer justification is that peremptories allow parties to excuse a juror about whom they have a hunch that does not rise to the level of a challenge for cause, or whom they may have offended through vigorous (but unsuccessful) voir dire questioning. Still a third justification, if it is that, holds that peremptories allow lawyers to exercise various hunches about the characteristics of social groups: Are blue-collar, rural whites of northern European descent likely to be more defense-oriented than African-American Catholics? Are elderly accountants less generous than young race car drivers? And so on.</p>
<p id="c0e0d322-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Taken to the extreme, however, peremptories conflict with the ideas of the cross-sectional jury embodied in statutes like 28 U.S.C. §1861. If society believes that juries composed of many different viewpoints are desirable, does it make sense to allow parties to negate that goal through the use of peremptories? In recent decades the Supreme Court (as well as statutes and common law decisions in <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="617" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page617">p. 617</span>many states) has changed the law and the landscape regarding peremptory challenges. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that unaccountability in peremptories stops when race and gender enter the picture. In Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986), the Court in a criminal case held that the prosecution’s systematic striking of Black jurors without a justification based on nonracial factors violated the defendant’s and jurors’ rights to equal protection, and harmed the community at large. Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U.S. 614 (1991), extended <i>Batson</i> to civil cases, and subsequent cases have expanded the impermissible categories to include gender. J.E.B. v. Alabama, 511 U.S. 127 (1994).</p>

How do such objections to challenges work? According to <i>Batson</i>, a party must first make an initial showing (a “prima facie case") that allows a court to infer a pattern based on race or gender; that showing then requires the party exercising the peremptory challenge to offer a satisfactory reason—one not based on race or gender. Suppose that Betty, a dismissed employee of a state university, sues, alleging wrongful discharge. After voir dire comes the time for the parties to exercise their peremptory challenges.</p>

<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
<li class=""><p id="c0e0fa3a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Imagine a <i>Batson</i> challenge to a peremptory challenge. Asked to justify what is an apparently race- or gender-based pattern, the lawyer responds, “I didn’t like the way she looked at me during voir dire.” If the court accepts that justification, then <i>Edmonson</i> and <i>J.E.B.</i> do little to constrain the jury selection process.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0e0fa3b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alternatively, suppose that counsel replies, “Yes, it’s true that both challenged jurors were women [or African Americans], but my real reason was that they occupied managerial positions, and I am therefore concerned that they will not be sympathetic to my client’s claim of wrongful discharge from <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="618" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page618">p. 618</span>her job.” If courts refuse to accept that justification, they will effectively eliminate peremptory challenges.

<li class=""><p id="c0e0fa3c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider a case displaying the interaction of challenges for cause with a peremptory challenge. The underlying case was a Title VII action in which plaintiff alleged employment discrimination. During voir dire, one juror, Ms. Leiter, expressed skepticism about such suits: “Leiter raised her hand and explained that she has ’been an owner of a couple of businesses and am currently an owner of a business, and I feel that as an employer and owner of a business that will definitely sway my judgment in this case.’ The judge asked her whether ’if I instructed you as to what the law is that you would be able to apply the law recognizing that you are a business owner?’ To which she replied, ’I think my experience will cloud my judgment, but I can do my best.’” One of the parties’ lawyers then asked Leiter “whether she was concerned ’that if somebody doesn’t get them [benefits sought from their employer] they’re going to sue you,’ and she answered, ’Of course.’ Asked then whether ’you believe that people file lawsuits just because they don’t get something they want?’, she answered, ’I believe there are some people that do.’” Thompson v. Altheimer &amp; Gray, 248 F.3d 621 (7th Cir. 2003).</p>

The plaintiff’s lawyer used all of her three peremptory challenges on jurors other than Leiter. The jury returned a defense verdict.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0e0fa3e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Was it error not to remove Leiter for cause? The Seventh Circuit equivocated, holding not that Leiter should have been removed for cause but reversing because the trial judge did not get from Ms. Leiter a stronger assurance that she would decide entirely on the basis of the evidence and the law: “Had the judge pushed Leiter and had she finally given unequivocal assurances that he deemed credible, his ruling could not be disturbed. But he failed to do that. The venire contained 20 prospective jurors, and more than enough were left to make up a full jury of 8 when he refused to excuse her. A candid and thoughtful person, if one may judge from the transcript, Leiter would probably have made an excellent juror—in another case.  . . . ”</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0e0fa3f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Seventh Circuit holds that the judge’s failure to elicit from Leiter a statement that she could be open-minded was reversible error. What assumptions about human psychology underlie such a ruling?</p>

<p id="c0e12054-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At this point our examination of trial pivots from “Who?” to “How?” Up to now, the chapter has examined the law surrounding the people who will hear and decide a case if it goes to trial. We now turn to the rules that structure the trial, beginning with a process that one can with equal accuracy describe as the end of pleading or the start of trial—the final pretrial conference.</p>
<p id="c0e12055-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One would expect that the question posed by this section’s heading would long since have been answered. Isn’t that what pleadings are for? And, if some of the allegations in those pleadings lacked factual or legal support, would they not have disappeared in motions on the pleadings and summary judgment?</p>
<p id="c0e12056-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Perhaps. But because discovery will not resolve all factual questions, and because counsel may wish to leave open as late as possible alternative legal theories of their claims and defenses, there may still be some question about what issues trial will address. Modern civil litigation does not leave these questions open until the trial itself. One way in which the Federal Rules force answers to these ques­tions is by requiring, through Rule 16(e), a “final pretrial conference and order.”</p>
<p id="c0e12057-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other conferences with the court, including the scheduling conference mandated by Rule 16(b) and optional pretrial conferences the judge may hold to discuss various matters, focus primarily on the pretrial stage of the case and, perhaps, efforts to settle or dismiss before trial. The final pretrial conference, in contrast, assumes a trial will occur—and soon. The final pretrial conference aims solely at clarifying the issues that trial will be about—"to formulate a trial plan,” as the Rule puts it. As Rule 16(e) states, the “conference must be held as close to the start of the trial as is reasonable,” and goes on to state that “[t]he court may modify the order issued after a final pretrial conference only to prevent manifest injustice.” Contrast that rather stern statement with the permissive standard for amending pleadings ("The court should freely give leave [to amend a pleading] when justice so requires.” Rule 15(a)). A final pretrial order—and an unsuccessful effort to convince the court to allow an amendment—is at stake in the next case.</p>

It was treatable but required immediate attention. Thanks to a variety of bureaucratic blunders the news never made it to him. Instead, Mr. Shatwell was sent home with a prescription for antibiotics. By the time he learned the truth a year later, it was too late.</p>
<p id="c0e1205e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Eventually, his widowed wife pursued negligence claims against the doctors and hospital.

Then, two weeks before trial, some of the defendants settled. Dr. Kenneth Phillips wasn’t one of those. Left to stand trial and with just days before jury selection, he sought permission to amend the pretrial order so he could revamp his trial strategy. Now he wanted to pursue a defense pinning the blame on the absent settling defendants, arguing that they were indeed negligent and that they—not he—should be held responsible for any damages. Dr. Phillips’s motion to amend the final pretrial order sought permission to introduce new jury instructions, exhibits, and witnesses aimed at advancing this new defense. But the district court denied the motion and at the trial’s end the jury found him liable for damages of a little over $1 million. Dr. Phillips now asks us to overturn the judgment, contending that the district court’s refusal to amend the final pretrial order and allow his new defense amounts to reversible error.</p>
<p id="c0e1205f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Final pretrial orders seek to “formulate a trial plan.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(e). In their complaints and answers lawyers and parties today often list every alternative and contradictory claim or defense known to the law; during discovery they sometimes depose every potential witness still breathing and collect every bit and byte of evidence technology, time, and money will allow. Final pretrial orders seek to tame such exuberant modern pretrial practices and focus the mind on the impending reality of trial. “The casual pleading [and discovery] indulged by the courts under the Federal Rules. . . . has quite naturally led to"—some might say required—"more and more emphasis on pre-trial hearings and statements to define the issues” for trial. Meadow Gold Prods. Co. v. Wright, 278 F.2d 867, 868-69 (D.C. Cir. 1960). Leaving the reins so loose at the front end of the case requires some method of gathering them up as the end approaches. At trial you just can’t argue every contradictory and mutually exclusive claim or defense you were able to conjure in your pleadings: juries would lose faith in your credibility. Neither can you present the millions of documents and the scores of witnesses you were able to dig up in discovery: no sensible judge would tolerate it. Final pretrial orders encourage both sides to edit their scripts, peel away any pleading and discovery bluster, and disclose something approximating their real trial intentions to opposing counsel and the court. Toward those ends, the parties are often asked—as they were in this case—to specify the witnesses and exhibits, supply the proposed jury instructions, and identify the claims and defenses they actually intend to introduce at trial.</p>
<p id="c0e14770-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While pretrial orders entered earlier in the life of a case often deal with interstitial questions like discovery staging and motions practice and are relatively easy to amend as a result, a final pretrial order focused on formulating a plan for an impending trial may be amended “only to prevent manifest injustice.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(e). Even that standard isn’t meant to preclude any flexibility—trials are high human dramas; surprises always emerge; and no judge worth his salt can forget or fail to sympathize with the challenges the trial lawyer confronts. For all our extensive pretrial procedures, even the most meticulous trial plan today probably remains no more reliable a guide than the script in a high school play—provisional at best and with surprising deviations guaranteed. At the same time, the standard for modifying a final pretrial order is as high as it is to ensure everyone involved has sufficient incentive to fulfill the order’s dual purposes of encouraging self-editing and <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="621" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page621">p. 621</span>providing reasonably fair disclosure to the court and opposing parties alike of their real trial intentions. This court will review a district court’s decision to amend or not to amend a pretrial order only for abuse of discretion.</p>
<p id="c0e14771-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We see nothing like that here. Dr. Phillips says that he was surprised when his co-defendants left him to stand trial and that the court was insufficiently sympathetic to his desire to revamp his trial strategy in light of the last-minute settlement. But can a partial settlement really come as a surprise in an age when virtually all cases settle in part or in whole, many on the eve of trial? Especially in multiparty litigation, where an incentive exists to break ranks, settle relatively cheaply, and leave others on the hook before the jury? The truth is, what happened in this case was hardly unforeseeable. Like many before him in multi-defendant cases, Dr. Phillips initially saw profit in presenting a united front with his co-defendants only to regret the decision later. United front defenses often present a tempting choice at the outset of multiparty cases and through discovery. Parties can pool their resources and efforts in joint defense arrangements. Besides, no one likes to throw overboard someone else in the same boat. But the complications associated with this strategic choice often come home to roost as trial nears. An attractive partial settlement may be dangled before one defendant and not others. The settling defendant may get a good deal, replenish an opponent’s litigation coffers depleted through exhausting pretrial litigation, and leave others exposed at trial for the bulk of the plaintiff’s damages. Remaining defendants can be left wishing for a defense or evidence or witnesses forgone. If a remaining defendant’s attorney counted on a colleague working for a settling party to do the heavy lifting at trial he may feel flat-footed when it comes to examining witnesses and arguing motions. Even if all the defendants do go to trial, failing to obtain experts and gather evidence to show contributory negligence by co-defendants can exact its toll and lead to regret. Multiparty litigation presents a variety of collective action problems and other strategic pitfalls and those Dr. Phillips encountered here are well known, not the stuff of surprise.</p>
<p id="c0e14772-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It’s hard, as well, to ignore the prejudice the other side can experience in these circumstances. Dr. Phillips effectively sought to force the plaintiff to prepare for an entirely different trial on a few days’ notice. For the better part of two years the defendants presented a united front. Even in their final pretrial order submissions they didn’t designate experts to suggest one or another of the codefendants acted unprofessionally. They didn’t submit documents to prove such a claim. They didn’t propose jury instructions asking that someone else be held accountable. The closest they came to suggesting contributory negligence was to prepare boilerplate blaming unspecified others for Mr. Shatwell’s injuries. Beyond that, through the long months of discovery and into their final Rule 16(e) submissions, nothing. In these circumstances, the plaintiff and her lawyers had some reasonable expectations about what trial would look like and the sort of evidence they would—and would not—need. They knew they’d need to prove negligence by the defendants who chose to go to trial but they wouldn’t have to worry about finger pointing between defendants; trial would present one set of challenges but not another.</p>
<p id="c0e14773-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It may be that the district court could have allowed Dr. Phillips to rejigger his defense at the last minute and afforded the plaintiff more time to prepare for it. But we do not see why that outcome was mandatory. A district court does not abuse its <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="622" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page622">p. 622</span>discretion in holding a party to a long-scheduled trial and to the strategy he articulated though pleading and discovery and in the face of such obvious risks, especially when indulging an eleventh-hour strategic shift would mean either imposing prejudice on the other side or inviting more delay. So beware: when a fellow litigant settles on the eve of trial you can’t bank on the right to claim surprise and rewrite your case from top to bottom.</p>

<p id="c0e16e93-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dr. Phillips ended up losing big in this case. From one standpoint, he was hung out to dry by his codefendants, who settled, leaving him to defend the case alone. From another point of view—the one adopted by the court—Phillips’s lawyer wasn’t looking far enough ahead, thinking about the possibility that the some or all of the codefendants would settle.</p>
<p id="c0e16e94-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose Phillips’s lawyer had contemplated this possibility. (Phillips’s lawyer may well have been hired by a liability insurer and, if so, was likely to be familiar with such multi-defendant cases.) What could she have done? If you look back to Chapter 8, two possibilities present themselves. One is an agreement among defendants about how, if they are held liable, they will apportion the costs among themselves. Another is a sliding scale agreement with the plaintiff, spelling out how liability will be apportioned given various settlements and adjudicated outcomes.</p>

<p id="c0e16e97-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once a jury—a second potential decision maker—enters the picture, one needs principles defining judges’ and juries’ respective spheres of competence and power. At trial, lawyers will present witnesses and evidence and offer their most compelling description of their clients’ claims and defenses to the jurors deciding the case. Yet jurors are, by definition, laypeople who may have little clue about the law underlying the stories they will hear from the parties, how to weigh the information at their disposal, or how many of them must agree to render a verdict. Accordingly, judges must instruct and guide juries at several points before and during their deliberations.</p>
<div id="c0e16e98-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c0e195a9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">1.&nbsp;Instruction and Comment</p></h3></div>

<p id="c0e195aa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Jurors will often not know the substantive law, so the judge teaches that law through jury instructions. See Rule 51. Notice that like so much else in U.S. procedure, this too depends on the parties, who must request instructions, and, in the absence of an objection, may not complain that the judge has wrongly instructed the jury. As you approach your first trial, work out proposed jury instructions way in advance of anything else—otherwise they will sneak up and bite you from behind.</p>
<p id="c0e195ab-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Instructions explain the substantive law that applies to the case, and the judge explains in a sequential way the decisions the jury must reach in a given case. For example, if the jury determines that the defendant was negligent, it must then decide whether the defendant’s negligence caused the injury of which the plaintiff is complaining.</p>
<p id="c0e195ac-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="624" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page624">p. 624</span>Jury instructions have two audiences. Their first audience is the jury itself, who may have an intuitive understanding of the law (quite likely in a negligence case) or none at all (as, for example, in antitrust). The second audience for jury instructions is the appellate court, which will reverse a case if an instruction misstates the law in a material way. These audiences have essentially incompatible requirements. The jury wants a simplified, easy-to-follow path through the wilderness of evidence to help it distinguish the central from the peripheral and to explain what factors should go into its decision on each question. The appellate court wants a nuanced, perfectly balanced, all-inclusive statement of the law. The clash between these contradictory requirements means that most instructions are compromises. Traditionally, juries received no instructions until the case was finished, at which point jurors sometimes learned they had been paying attention to the wrong things. Today some courts are experimenting with staged instructions, instructing juries on aspects of the law pertinent to particular parts of evidence as it comes in; preliminary information suggests the staged instructions are helpful.</p>
<p id="c0e195ad-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Besides telling the jury what the law is, the judge may tell the jury what she thinks of the evidence. Here the law speaks to the judge with a mixed voice. In federal courts at least, the judge has the theoretical power to comment on the evidence. That power is hedged, however, with many qualifications and with exhortations that the judge not trespass onto the jury’s autonomous decision-making space. Judges who do so egregiously—like the judge who solemnly informed a jury that in his experience witnesses who wiped their hands while testifying were liars, Quercia v. United States, 289 U.S. 466, 468 (1933)—are reversed.</p>

<p id="c0e195b0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Early medieval juries were supposed already to know the relevant facts (Was John seised of Blackacre on the day the Old King died?). Modern juries are supposed to know nothing about the case except what they learn at trial; a juror who said he’d been at the intersection at the time of the accident and was familiar with both parties’ driving records—making him an ideal medieval juror—would immediately be excused for cause.</p>
<p id="c0e195b1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Besides proper instructions about the law, juries need insulation from improper influences. The process starts well before trial gets under way. Screening the jury through voir dire (see supra page 614) seeks to eliminate jurors whose sympathies or inability to understand the evidence might cause them to reach irrational verdicts. During the trial, judges try to ensure that jurors will consider only information screened through the law of evidence (many of whose parts can be explained as efforts to insulate jurors from information that might be misleading).</p>
<p id="c0e195b2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even good-faith efforts by jurors to bring their fellow jurors information not filtered through the evidentiary and adversarial screens may result in reversal. For example, in a case that turned on whether aluminum electrical wiring was dangerous, one juror, after hearing testimony to that effect, went home, examined the wiring in his own home, and reported his findings to his fellow jurors the next day. The appellate court ordered a new trial. In re Beverly Hills Fire Litigation, 695 F.2d 207 (6th Cir. 1982).</p>

In extreme instances, where the case is the subject of much public discussion, the judge can sequester the jury. In recent years the wide availability of web-based information has posed another problem. Lawyers and judges report juries “contaminated” by jurors who research matters at issue in the trial (What does the intersection look like? Have others reported injuries from this product? Has defendant been sued by others?), and judges will often instruct jurors not to use such tools.</p>

<p id="c0e1bcc6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Still another way of preventing juries from reaching aberrant conclusions involves jury size and jury decision rules. The underlying ideas are that groups will render decisions that cancel out aberrant views of one or two members, and that requiring consensus assures full discussion of the evidence. At early common law a jury consisted of 12 persons; the verdict was required to be unanimous; and the verdict could be attacked only by “attaint,” a process in which a second jury, twice as large, considered charges that the first jury had been deliberately untruthful in its verdict. Those rules have changed—in the federal courts—in recent decades.</p>
<p id="c0e1bcc7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the widely criticized decision of Colgrove v. Battin, 413 U.S. 149 (1973), the Supreme Court constitutionalized six-person civil juries, which are now in widespread use in federal courts and in some states. What difference does it make? Fundamentally, a smaller jury is less “average,” less representative. Smaller juries are less likely to include any given point of view or social characteristic—race, political views, economic status, and so on. Just as a single individual is more likely to be eccentric than a large group, so smaller juries are more likely to render aberrant verdicts than are larger juries.</p>
<p id="c0e1bcc8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the federal system, unanimous verdicts in civil cases are still required unless the parties agree to accept a nonunanimous verdict. See Rule 48. Some states permit nonunanimous verdicts, usually allowing two or three opposing votes on a 12-person jury. Again one can ask what difference it makes. Rules of unanimity will result in more hung juries (a single holdout can block a verdict), requiring a retrial. Balanced against this loss of efficiency are some studies suggesting that groups where unanimity is required discuss the evidence with more intensity and in more detail than do groups where unanimity is not required.</p>
<p id="c0e1bcc9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notice that, combined, these changes in size and decision rules can magnify each other. Decreasing the size of the jury reduces the likelihood that any given social characteristic will be reflected in the jury’s membership. Moreover, abolishing the unanimity requirement lessens the effect that social diversity will have on the jury’s verdict: If jurors do not have to render a unanimous verdict, the majority can simply ignore the point of view of one or two individuals.</p>

But even an unbiased fact-finder can go wrong. The system therefore worries about two problems: juries reaching verdicts unsustainable in logic; and, conversely, judges <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="626" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page626">p. 626</span>improperly seizing control of litigation from juries. The next two sections examine the procedures and doctrines designed to prevent either of these from happening. At the outset, it’s worth noting that judges and juries appear to agree with each other in the very great majority of cases.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10637_d543ff9e-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10637_d543ff9e-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">6</a></span> So the cases and principles examined here apply in the cases where judge and jury disagree. Who then prevails—and how?</p>
<p id="c0e1bccd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Several circumstances make it difficult to police the boundary between these shared responsibilities. First, in modern civil procedure only closely balanced cases will come to trial. Summary judgment will have weeded out most of the rest. Accordingly, every case should be a close one. Second, we have aspirations for the jury beyond simple fact-finding, although finding facts in the midst of conflict and perjury is hardly simple. The jury also serves as the voice of the community, tempering and making acceptable applications of law that might otherwise be resented or resisted. Finally, it is a temporary, lay, and democratic institution that stands at the core of a permanent, professional, and elite institution—the judiciary. The two latter roles conflict at times with fact-finding, at least if that task is understood in a limited way. To ask juries to decide cases, then, is to permit them—or even to require them—to do something more than find facts. If one accepts these propositions, the task of procedure becomes more difficult. The litigation system is dedicated to rationality. It is also, however, committed to a model of fact-finding that blends rationality with other goals. How does one frame procedural rules that give juries sufficient leeway to perform the tasks we have set for them without irreparably compromising the rationality of verdicts?</p>

In a negligence case, the plaintiff presents no evidence that the defendant’s negligence caused the accident. Or in a case where the defense rests solely on the statute of limitations, the only evidence points to the critical events having occurred within the statute. In such cases the opposing party can ask the judge to grant “judgment as a matter of law.” Read Rule 50(a). If the court grants such a motion, the jury will not receive the case (or that part of it as to which the motion is granted). Historically, the grant of such a motion was called a “directed verdict,”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10655_d543ff9e-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10655_d543ff9e-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">7</a></span> a term that many state courts and lawyers continue to use.</p>

Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U.S. 133 (2000). At both summary judgment and directed verdict, the question is whether—drawing all inferences in favor of the nonmoving party and avoiding credibility determinations or weighing of the evidence—the party with the burden of production has put forth sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.</p>

This phrase captures an essential implication of party responsibility for proof. The system assigns to the parties—more precisely to one of the parties—the responsibility for investigating, discovering, marshaling evidence, and presenting that evidence to the trier of fact. If that party fails to carry the burden assigned, she loses the case. You have already seen the burden of production operating in summary judgment. At the heart of <i>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett</i>, supra page 573, lies a hard truth: A party with the burden of production can lose even before trial if she fails to demonstrate, among the facts uncovered by investigation and discovery, sufficient evidence to allow a rational trier of fact to find in her favor.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0e1e3e6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To understand why lawyers care about burdens of production, take an example from a simple auto accident case. Plaintiff has the burden of production on negligence. What does that mean in practice? First, the plaintiff has to decide how she is going to show defendant’s negligence: Will she base it on faulty maintenance, speeding, inebriation, failure to watch opposing traffic, driving in spite of a disabling medical condition, or some other breach of care? This initial decision will flow in large measure from plaintiff’s sense of the facts: One would risk sanctions as well as failure on the merits if one based one’s case on defendant’s inebriation without having any factual foundation.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0e1e3e7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Let’s assume that plaintiff reports that defendant ran the red light. That would provide an adequate basis for pleading negligence while meeting the factual foundation requirements of Rule 11. Discovery might, of course, turn up other information—faulty maintenance of defendant’s brakes, say—and it might cast doubt on the original theory: Plaintiff thinks she saw defendant run the light, but other, disinterested witnesses deny it. Whatever plaintiff’s theory of negligence, she has the responsibility for gathering and presenting evidence on that theory. Let’s assume that plaintiff thinks her strongest case is the “defendant ran the light” story. To carry her burden of production on the question of whether the defendant ran the red light, it is up to plaintiff <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="628" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page628">p. 628</span>to find the witnesses, interview or depose them, get their affidavits (to avoid summary judgment), make sure they come to court on the day of trial, and conduct the direct examination in a way that makes their statements admissible. If the plaintiff fails in any of these steps, she loses—even though, as a matter of historical fact, the defendant did run the red light. The plaintiff loses because she has failed to satisfy the burden of production—of coming forward with evidence from which a rational trier of fact could conclude some proposition of material fact.</p></li>

<p id="c0e20b09-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With these foundational matters to one side, the great and difficult question in directing verdicts lies before us: When may a court interfere with the jury’s fact-finding and law-applying role? We have already explored these questions as they relate to summary judgment. In <i>Houchens</i> (supra page 38), we saw a situation in which the court granted summary judgment because there was no evidence from which a rational fact-finder could have found for Mrs. Houchens. But what if there’s <i>some</i> evidence? Can a judge decide whom to believe? The well-established law in this area says that a judge may never make a credibility determination in granting judgment as a matter of law—credibility is a matter for the jury. Nor may a judge “weigh” the evidence, as opposed to finding whether there <i>is</i> any evidence from which the jury could find for the party against whom the motion is directed. When you read <i>Tolan</i> and <i>Bias</i> (in Chapter 8), you considered whether the courts had followed these tenets in the summary judgment context. In the next case, an appeal of a directed verdict, decide whether the U.S. Supreme Court is adhering to these standards or fudging them.</p>

<p id="c0e20b0f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is an action brought by respondent against petitioner to recover for the death of a brakeman, alleged to have been caused by petitioner’s negligence. The complaint alleges that the deceased, at the time of the accident resulting in his death, <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="630" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page630">p. 630</span>was assisting in the yard work of breaking up and making up trains and in the classifying and assorting of cars operating in interstate commerce; that in pursuance of such work, while riding a cut of cars, other cars ridden by fellow employees were negligently caused to be brought into violent contact with those upon which deceased was riding, with the result that he was thrown therefrom to the railroad track and run over by a car or cars, inflicting injuries from which he died.</p>
<p id="c0e23220-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the conclusion of the evidence, the trial court directed the jury to find a verdict in favor of petitioner. Judgment upon a verdict so found was reversed by the court of appeals, Judge Swan dissenting.</p>
<p id="c0e23221-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That part of the yard in which the accident occurred contained a lead track and a large number of switching tracks branching therefrom. The lead track crossed a “hump,” and the work of car distribution consisted of pushing a train of cars by means of a locomotive to the top of the “hump,” and then allowing the cars, in separate strings, to descend by gravity, under the control of hand brakes, to their respective destinations in the various branch tracks. Deceased had charge of a string of two gondola cars, which he was piloting to track 14. Immediately ahead of him was a string of seven cars, and behind him a string of nine cars, both also destined for track 14. Soon after the cars ridden by deceased had passed to track 14, his body was found on that track some distance beyond the switch. He had evidently fallen onto the track and been run over by a car or cars.</p>
<p id="c0e23222-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case for respondent rests wholly upon the claim that the fall of deceased was caused by a violent collision of the string of nine cars with the string ridden by deceased. Three employees, riding the nine-car string, testified positively that no such collision occurred. They were corroborated by every other employee in a position to see, all testifying that there was no contact between the nine-car string and that of the deceased. The testimony of these witnesses, if believed, establishes beyond doubt that there was no collision between these two strings of cars, and that the nine-car string contributed in no way to the accident. The only witness who testified for the respondent was one Bainbridge; and it is upon his testimony alone that respondent’s right to recover is sought to be upheld. His testimony is concisely stated, in its most favorable light for respondent, in the prevailing opinion below by Judge Learned Hand, as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0e23223-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff’s only witness to the event, one Bainbridge, then employed by the road, stood close to the yardmaster’s office, near the “hump.” He professed to have paid little attention to what went on, but he did see the deceased riding at the rear of his cars, whose speed when they passed him he took to be about eight or ten miles. Shortly thereafter a second string passed which was shunted into another track and this was followed by the nine, which, according to the plaintiff’s theory, collided with the deceased’s. After the nine cars had passed at a somewhat greater speed than the deceased’s, Bainbridge paid no more attention to either string for a while, but looked again when the deceased, who was still standing in his place, had passed the switch and onto the assorting track where he was bound. At that time his speed had been checked to about three miles, but the speed of the following nine cars had increased. They were just passing the switch, about four or five cars behind the deceased. Bainbridge looked away again and soon heard what he described as a “loud crash,” not however an unusual event in a switching yard. Apparently this did not cause him at once to turn, but he did so shortly thereafter, <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="631" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page631">p. 631</span>and saw the two strings together still moving, and the deceased no longer in sight. Later still his attention was attracted by shouts and he went to the spot and saw the deceased between the rails. Until he left to go to the accident, he had stood fifty feet to the north of the track where the accident happened, and about nine hundred feet from where the body was found.</p>
</div>
<p id="c0e23224-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court, although regarding Bainbridge’s testimony as not only “somewhat suspicious in itself, but its contradiction. . . . so manifold as to leave little doubt,” held, nevertheless, that the question was one of fact depending upon the credibility of the witnesses, and that it was for the jury to determine, as between the one witness and the many, where the truth lay. The dissenting opinion of Judge Swan proceeds upon the theory that Bainbridge did not testify that in fact a collision had taken place, but inferred it because he heard a crash, and because thereafter the two strings of cars appeared to him to be moving together. It is correctly pointed out in that opinion, however, that the crash might have come from elsewhere in the busy yard and that Bainbridge was in no position to see whether the two strings of cars were actually together; that Bainbridge repeatedly said he was paying no particular attention; and that his position was such, being 900 feet from the place where the body was found and less than 50 feet from the side of the track in question, that he necessarily saw the strings of cars at such an acute angle that it would be physically impossible even for an attentive observer to tell whether the forward end of the nine-car cut was actually in contact with the rear end of the two-car cut. The dissenting opinion further points out that all the witnesses who were in a position to see testified that there was no collision; that respondent’s evidence was wholly circumstantial, and the inferences which might otherwise be drawn from it were shown to be utterly erroneous unless all of petitioner’s witnesses were willful perjurers. “This is not a case,” the opinion proceeds, “where direct testimony to an essential fact is contradicted by direct testimony of other witnesses, though even there it is conceded a directed verdict might be proper in some circumstances. Here, when all the testimony was in, the circumstantial evidence in support of negligence was thought by the trial judge to be so insubstantial and insufficient that it did not justify submission to the jury.” We thus summarize and quote from the prevailing and dissenting opinions, because they present the divergent views to be considered in reaching a correct determination of the question involved. It, of course, is true, generally, that where there is a direct conflict of testimony upon a matter of fact, the question must be left to the jury to determine, without regard to the number of witnesses upon either side. But here there really is no conflict in the testimony as to the <i>facts</i>. The witnesses for petitioner flatly testified that there was no collision between the nine-car and the two-car strings. Bainbridge did not say there was such a collision. What he said was that he heard a “loud crash,” which did not cause him at once to turn, but that shortly thereafter he did turn and saw the two strings of cars moving together with the deceased no longer in sight; that there was nothing unusual about the crash of cars—it happened every day; that there was nothing about this crash to attract his attention except that it was extra loud; that he paid no attention to it; that it was not sufficient to attract his attention. The record shows that there was a continuous movement of cars over and down the “hump,” which were distributed among a large number of branch tracks within the yard, and that any two strings of these cars moving upon the same track might <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="632" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page632">p. 632</span>have come together and caused the crash which Bainbridge heard. There is no direct evidence that <i>in fact</i> the crash was occasioned by a collision of the two strings in question; and it is perfectly clear that no such fact was brought to Bainbridge’s attention as a perception of the physical sense of sight or of hearing. At most there was an inference to that effect drawn from observed facts which gave equal support to the opposite inference that the crash was occasioned by the coming together of other strings of cars entirely away from the scene of the accident, or of the two-car string ridden by deceased and the seven-car string immediately ahead of it.</p>
<p id="c0e23225-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We, therefore, have a case belonging to that class of cases where proven facts give equal support to each of two inconsistent inferences; in which event, neither of them being established, judgment, as a matter of law, must go against the party upon whom rests the necessity of sustaining one of these inferences as against the other, before he is entitled to recover.</p>
<p id="c0e23226-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rule is succinctly stated in Smith v. First National Bank in Westfield, 99 Mass. 605, 611-612, quoted in the <i>Des Moines National Bank</i> case [United States F. &amp; G. Co. v. Des Moines National Bank, 145 F. 273, 280 (8th Cir. 1906)]:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0e23227-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There being several inferences deducible from the facts which appear, and equally consistent with all those facts, the plaintiff has not maintained the proposition upon which alone he would be entitled to recover. There is strictly no evidence to warrant a jury in finding that the loss was occasioned by negligence and not by theft. When the evidence tends equally to sustain either of two inconsistent propositions, neither of them can be said to have been established by legitimate proof. A verdict in favor of the party bound to maintain one of those propositions against the other is necessarily wrong.</p>
</div>
<p id="c0e23228-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That Bainbridge concluded from what he himself observed that the crash was due to a collision between the two strings of cars in question is sufficiently indicated by his statements. But this, of course, proves nothing, since it is not allowable for a witness to resolve the doubt as to which of two equally justifiable inferences shall be adopted by drawing a conclusion, which, if accepted, will result in a purely gratuitous award in favor of the party who has failed to sustain the burden of proof cast upon him by the law.</p>
<p id="c0e23229-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And the desired inference is precluded for the further reason that respondent’s right of recovery depends upon the existence of a particular fact which must be inferred from proven facts, and this is not permissible in the face of the positive and otherwise uncontradicted testimony of unimpeached witnesses consistent with the facts actually proved, from which testimony it affirmatively appears that the fact sought to be inferred did not exist. . . . </p>
<p id="c0e2322a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not only is Bainbridge’s testimony considered as a whole suspicious, insubstantial and insufficient, but his statement that when he turned shortly after hearing the crash the two strings were moving together is simply incredible, if he meant thereby to be understood as saying that he saw the two in contact; and if he meant by the words “moving together” simply that they were moving at the same time in the same direction but not in contact, the statement becomes immaterial. As we have already seen he was paying slight and only occasional attention to what was going on. The cars were 800 or 900 feet from where he stood and moving almost directly away from him, his angle of vision being only 3°03 from a straight line. At that sharp angle <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="633" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page633">p. 633</span>and from that distance, near dusk of a misty evening (as the proof shows), the practical impossibility of the witness being able to see whether the front of the nine-car string was in contact with the back of the two-car string is apparent. And, certainly, in the light of these conditions, no verdict based upon a statement so unbelievable reasonably could be sustained as against the positive testimony to the contrary of unimpeached witnesses, all in a position to see, as this witness was not, the precise relation of the cars to one another. The fact that these witnesses were employees of the petitioner, under the circumstances here disclosed, does not impair this conclusion. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. v. Martin, 283 U.S. 209, 216-220. . . . </p>

In constructing such a story, consider a snippet from the opinion below, by Judge Learned Hand:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0e28057-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It does not appear to us impossible, or indeed improbable, that one in [Bainbridge’s] position could tell whether the two strings were together. The intervals between cars in a train are uniform; they may be detected by the straight sides. Certainly a gap of four or five car lengths, when the nine cars came to rest, would have been easily observable; and this was the story of the defendant. What Bainbridge saw, coupled with what he had heard, if uncontradicted, would be enough to support a finding that the nine cars had collided with the deceased’s and thrown him off. There is no inherent impossibility in the story.</p>

As the Supreme Court describes the case, Bainbridge’s testimony is suspicious because of his inadequate opportunity to observe, while the fellow workers’ contrary testimony is taken at face value. Is there reason to suspect the workers’ testimony? Is there reason to credit Bainbridge’s inference that the two strings collided?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0e2805a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Cases such as <i>Chamberlain</i> have been thought to raise two related issues. The first is the precise standard for taking the case from the jury—more particularly, which evidence should be considered by the court when deciding whether to do so. There is general agreement that the court should consider all evidence favorable to the nonmoving party, all inferences from that evidence, and all undisputed evidence. But should the court also consider testimonial and disputed evidence in favor of the moving party? Closely related is the matter of evaluating the evidence. Many courts have stated that the basic test is whether reasonable persons could differ; if they could, the court should defer to the jury on the ground that its members are reasonable persons whose verdict represents one of several reasonable views. A leading case articulating the prevailing view is Boeing Co. v. Shipman, 411 F.2d 365, 374-75 (5th Cir. 1969):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0e2805b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On motions for directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict [both now called judgment as a matter of law] the Court should consider all of the evidence—not just that evidence which supports the non-mover’s case—but in the light and with all reasonable inferences most favorable to the party opposed to the motion. If the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of one party that the Court believes that reasonable men could not arrive at a contrary verdict, granting of the motions is proper. On the other hand, if there is substantial evidence opposed to the motions, that is, evidence of such quality and weight that reasonable and fair-minded men in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions, the motions should be denied, and the case submitted to the jury. A mere scintilla of evidence is insufficient to present <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="635" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page635">p. 635</span>a question for the jury. The motions for [judgment as a matter of law] should not be decided by which side has the better of the case, nor should they be granted only when there is a complete absence of probative facts to support a jury verdict. There must be a conflict in substantial evidence to create a jury question. However, it is the function of the jury as the traditional finder of the facts, and not the Court, to weigh conflicting evidence and inferences, and determine the credibility of witnesses.</p>
</div></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0e2805c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Chamberlain</i>, the Court has to avoid questions of credibility because the jury is the undoubted arbiter of credibility. But we ask jurors to do much more than to decide who is telling the truth. We also give to the jury many questions that require them to apply general, open-ended standards to specific facts of the case. Was it negligent under these circumstances to be driving five miles faster than the speed limit? Was the behavior of one of the contracting parties unreasonable? To arrive at answers to such questions, juries may have to decide questions of fact. But even after doing so they must then apply the open texture of law to those facts.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0e2805d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because of this role, courts often give to juries cases where the facts are undisputed. A classic example is Railroad Co. v. Stout, 84 U.S. 657 (1873). A child was injured while playing on a railroad turntable located at the edge of a sparsely populated rural settlement. The turntable was not locked or fenced. No one contested any of these facts; the case went to the jury, which found negligence. Rejecting the railroad’s contentions that the judge should have taken the case from the jury, the Supreme Court wrote:</p>

<p id="c0e2805e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Upon the facts proven in such cases, it is a matter of judgment and discretion, of sound inference, what is the deduction to be drawn from the undisputed facts. Certain facts we may suppose to be clearly established from which one sensible, impartial man would infer that proper care had not been used, and that negligence existed; another man equally sensible and equally impartial would infer that proper care had been used, and that there was no negligence. It is this class of cases and those akin to it that the law commits to the decision of a jury. Twelve men of the average of the community, comprising men of education and men of little education, men of learning and men whose learning consists only in what they have themselves seen and heard, the merchant, the mechanic, the farmer, the laborer; these sit together, consult, apply their separate experience of the affairs of life to the facts proven, and draw a unanimous conclusion. This average judgment thus given it is the great effort of the law to obtain. It is assumed that twelve men know more of the common affairs of life than does one man, that they can draw wiser and safer conclusions from admitted facts thus occurring than can a single judge.</p>

<p id="c0e2a776-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why? <i>Celotex</i> said that at the summary judgment stage, parties have the same burden of production they will have at trial. If parties have made good use of discovery, they will, by the time for summary judgment, have assembled all the evidence that they will use at trial. A summary judgment motion asks whether this evidence would be sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to find in favor of the party with the burden of production. If not, the court should grant summary judgment against that party. So, if summary judgment is doing its job, all the cases where judgment as a matter of law might be granted will be screened out at the summary judgment stage, never reaching trial.</p>

For example, witnesses can change their stories or be unavailable to testify at trial, thus depriving a party of some critical piece of evidence.

No, the Supreme Court has held, and that holding has the force of the Seventh Amendment behind it. The reasoning is that at the time the Amendment was adopted, courts permitted such post-verdict motion only as a renewal of a similar pre-verdict motion. Because the Amendment forbids “reexamin[ing]” a verdict except as was permitted at common law, a post-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law standing alone would be unconstitutional.

<p id="c0e2ce96-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ordinarily, a party in a civil jury trial that believes the evidence is legally insufficient to support an adverse jury verdict will seek a judgment as a matter of law by filing a motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a) before submission of the case to the jury, and then (if the Rule 50(a) motion is not granted and the jury subsequently decides against that party) a motion pursuant to Rule 50(b). In this case, however, the respondent filed a Rule 50(a) motion before the verdict, but did not file a Rule 50(b) motion after the verdict. Nor did respondent request a new trial under Rule 59. The Court of Appeals nevertheless proceeded to review the sufficiency of the evidence and, upon a finding that the evidence was insufficient, remanded the case for a new trial.

<p id="c0e2ce98-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The genesis of the underlying litigation in this case was ConAgra’s attempt to enforce its patent for “A Method for Browning Precooked Whole Muscle Meat <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="638" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page638">p. 638</span>Products.” [In 2000, ConAgra issued a warning to companies who sold equipment and processes for browning precooked meats and its direct competitors in the precooked meat business. Unitherm, which had invented a similar process six years before ConAgra filed its patent application, sued ConAgra, alleging that ConAgra’s patent was invalid and that ConAgra had violated §2 of the Sherman Act “by attempting to enforce a patent that was obtained by committing fraud on the Patent and Trademark Office"—what is referred to as a <i>Walker Process</i> claim. The district court found that ConAgra’s patent was invalid and allowed the <i>Walker Process</i> antitrust claim to go to trial.]</p>
<p id="c0e2ce99-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prior to the court’s submission of the case to the jury, ConAgra moved for a directed verdict under Rule 50(a) based on legal insufficiency of the evidence. The District Court denied that motion. The jury returned a verdict for Unitherm, and ConAgra neither renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50(b), nor moved for a new trial on antitrust liability pursuant to Rule 59.</p>
<p id="c0e2ce9a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On appeal to the Federal Circuit [the court that hears appeals of cases arising under the Patent Act], ConAgra maintained that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the jury’s <i>Walker Process</i> verdict. Although the Federal Circuit has concluded that a party’s “failure to present the district court with a post-verdict motion precludes appellate review of sufficiency of the evidence,” in the instant case it was bound to apply the law of the Tenth Circuit. <i>Unitherm Food Sys.,</i> 375 F.3d at 1365 n.7 ("On most issues related to Rule 50 motions. . . . we generally apply regional circuit law unless the precise issue being appealed pertains uniquely to patent law"). Under Tenth Circuit law, a party that has failed to file a postverdict motion challenging the sufficiency of the evidence may nonetheless raise such a claim on appeal, so long as that party filed a Rule 50(a) motion prior to submission of the case to the jury. Notably, the only available relief in such a circumstance is a new trial.</p>
<p id="c0e2ce9b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Freed to examine the sufficiency of the evidence, the Federal Circuit concluded that, although Unitherm had presented sufficient evidence to support a determination that ConAgra had attempted to enforce a patent that it had obtained through fraud on the PTO, Unitherm had failed to present evidence sufficient to support the remaining elements of its antitrust claim. Accordingly, it vacated the jury’s judgment in favor of Unitherm and remanded for a new trial. We granted certiorari, and now reverse.</p>

<p id="c0e2ce9d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 sets forth the procedural requirements for challenging the sufficiency of the evidence in a civil jury trial and establishes two stages for such challenges—prior to submission of the case to the jury, and after the verdict and entry of judgment. Rule 50(a) allows a party to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence prior to submission of the case to the jury, and authorizes the district court to grant such motions at the court’s discretion. Rule 50(b), by contrast, sets forth the procedural requirements for renewing a sufficiency of the evidence challenge after the jury verdict and entry of judgment.</p>
<p id="c0e2ce9e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court has addressed the implications of a party’s failure to file a postverdict motion under Rule 50(b) on several occasions and in a variety of procedural contexts. <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="639" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page639">p. 639</span>This Court has concluded that, “[i]n the absence of such a motion” an “appellate court [is] without power to direct the District Court to enter judgment contrary to the one it had permitted to stand.” Cone v. West Virginia Pulp &amp; Paper Co., 330 U.S. 212, 218 (1947). This Court has similarly concluded that a party’s failure to file a Rule 50(b) motion deprives the appellate court of the power to order the entry of judgment in favor of that party where the district court directed the jury’s verdict, Globe Liquor Co. v. San Roman, 332 U.S. 571 (1948), and where the district court expressly reserved a party’s preverdict motion for a directed verdict and then denied that motion after the verdict was returned. A postverdict motion is necessary because “[d]etermination of whether a new trial should be granted or a judgment entered under Rule 50(b) calls for the judgment in the first instance of the judge who saw and heard the witnesses and has the feel of the case which no appellate printed transcript can impart.” Moreover, the “requirement of a timely application for judgment after verdict is not an idle motion” because it “is. . . . an essential part of the rule, firmly grounded in principles of fairness.”</p>
<p id="c0e2ce9f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The foregoing authorities lead us to reverse the judgment below. Respondent correctly points out that these authorities address whether an appellate court may enter judgment in the absence of a postverdict motion, as opposed to whether an appellate court may order a new trial (as the Federal Circuit did here). But this distinction is immaterial. This Court’s observations about the necessity of a postverdict motion under Rule 50(b), and the benefits of the district court’s input at that stage, apply with equal force whether a party is seeking judgment as a matter of law or simply a new trial. In <i>Cone,</i> this Court concluded that, because Rule 50(b) permits the district court to exercise its discretion to choose between ordering a new trial and entering judgment, its “appraisal of the bona fides of the claims asserted by the litigants is of great value in reaching a conclusion as to whether a <i>new trial</i> should be granted.” Similarly, this Court has determined that a party may only pursue on appeal a particular avenue of relief available under Rule 50(b), namely, the entry of judgment <i>or a new trial,</i> when that party has complied with the Rule’s filing requirements by requesting that particular relief below. . . . </p>
<p id="c0e2f5b0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he text and application of Rule 50(a) support our determination that respondent may not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal on the basis of the District Court’s denial of its Rule 50(a) motion. . . . [W]hile a district court is permitted to enter judgment as a matter of law when it concludes that the evidence is legally insufficient, it is not required to do so. To the contrary, the district courts are, if anything, encouraged to submit the case to the jury, rather than granting such motions. As Wright and Miller explain:</p>

<p id="c0e2f5b1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Even at the close of all the evidence it may be desirable to refrain from granting a motion for judgment as a matter of law despite the fact that it would be possible for the district court to do so. If judgment as a matter of law is granted and the appellate court holds that the evidence in fact was sufficient to go to the jury, an entire new trial must be had. If, on the other hand, the trial court submits the case to the jury, though it thinks the evidence insufficient, final determination of the case is expedited greatly. If the jury agrees with the court’s appraisal of the evidence, and returns a verdict for the party who moved for judgment as a matter of law, the case is at an end. If the jury brings in a different verdict, the trial court can grant a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law. Then if the <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="640" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page640">p. 640</span>appellate court holds that the trial court was in error in its appraisal of the evidence, it can reverse and order judgment on the verdict of the jury, without any need for a new trial. For this reason the appellate courts repeatedly have said that it usually is desirable to take a verdict, and then pass on the sufficiency of the evidence on a post-verdict motion.” 9A Federal Practice §2533, at 319 (footnote omitted).</p>

<p id="c0e2f5b2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, the District Court’s denial of respondent’s preverdict motion cannot form the basis of respondent’s appeal, because the denial of that motion was not error. It was merely an exercise of the District Court’s discretion, in accordance with the text of the Rule and the accepted practice of permitting the jury to make an initial judgment about the sufficiency of the evidence. The only error here was counsel’s failure to file a postverdict motion pursuant to Rule 50(b).</p>

For that reason Congress has preserved the federal appeals courts’ power to correct plain error, even though trial counsel’s omission will ordinarily give rise to a binding waiver. This is not a case, in my view, in which the authority of the appellate court is limited by an explicit statute or controlling rule. The spirit of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure favors preservation of a court’s power to avoid manifestly unjust results in exceptional cases. Moreover, we have an overriding duty to obey statutory commands that unambiguously express the intent of Congress even in areas such as procedure in which we may have special expertise.</p>

The majority’s holding is inconsistent with a statute enacted just months after <i>Globe Liquor</i> was decided. That statute, which remains in effect today, provides:</p>

In the first variation, imagine that Peters produced a witness—a witness who was near the intersection when the accident occurred and testified that Dodge’s light was red. Further suppose that the trial judge thought the witness’s testimony was very weak: The witness happens to work with Peters’s mother, and so might be biased; moreover, she suffered from macular degeneration, making her ability to perceive the events suspect. Nevertheless, the jury returned a plaintiff’s verdict. In the second variation, suppose that unbiased and clear-sighted but contradictory witnesses testify about whether Peters or Dodge was in the wrong. In this version, however, the judge realizes after the jury has returned a defendant’s verdict that he failed to give a requested instruction on the substantive law, forgetting to make it clear that Peters had to show not only Dodge’s negligence, but that the negligence (rather, say than a preexisting injury) caused Peters’s medical condition.</p>

<p id="c0e31cdc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In both cases the procedural remedy is not judgment as a matter of law, but an order for a new trial, governed by Rule 59. Rule 59 does not specify the grounds for which a new trial may be ordered, stating only that the court may do so “for any reason for which a new trial has heretofore been granted in an action at law in federal court.” Do you see the Reexamination Clause of the Seventh Amendment lurking behind that phrasing? A fairly well-developed body of common law suggests two principal reasons for granting new trials, one focusing on the procedure leading up to the verdict, the other on the correctness of the verdict itself.</p>

Ordering a new trial gives the judge a chance to fix the flawed process. And, unlike Rule 50, Rule 59(d) explicitly gives the judge power to order a new trial even if neither party so moves.</p>

<p id="c0e31ce2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if the trial was perfect, the judge may conclude that the result of that trial—the verdict—is unjustifiable. Probably the most common ground for granting a new trial is that the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence. Understanding this idea requires a glance back at judgments as a matter of law. Although both judgments as a matter of law and new trials result from verdicts with little or no evidentiary support, it is important to understand the difference between them. The consequences of each reflect their different rationales. In granting judgment as a matter of law, a court is saying that the winner of the verdict had no evidentiary support for at least one essential element of his claim or defense. Judgment as a matter of law results in an immediate entry of judgment for the loser of the verdict. By contrast, the grant of a new trial does not make a winner out of a loser; it merely begins the contest again. The standard is accordingly lower: As most courts would put it, a judge may grant a new trial when the verdict is “against the great weight of the evidence.” Those same courts would agree, however, that in considering whether to grant a new trial the trial judge may not simply decide how she would have voted as a juror. Where the standard lies between these two poles is harder to say.</p>

Schenley filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law and, alternatively, for a new trial. The trial judge granted the 50(b) motion and, in the alternative, a new trial (see Rule 50(c), which mandates such contingent rulings). The plaintiff appealed. The court of appeals first held that it was error for the trial judge to grant the Rule 50(b) motion. It then considered the motion for a new trial.]</p>

<p id="c0e343ff-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The remaining basis for ordering a new trial is that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. It is frequently stated that a motion for a new trial on this ground ordinarily is nonreviewable because within the discretion of the trial court. But this discretion must still be exercised in accordance with ascertainable legal standards and if an appellate court is shown special or unusual circumstances which clearly indicate an abuse of discretion in that the trial court failed to apply correctly the proper standards, reversal is possible. Concededly appellate courts rarely find that the trial court abused its discretion.</p>

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0e34401-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is a principle well recognized in the federal courts that the granting or refusing of a new trial is a matter resting within the discretion of the trial court. The term “discretion,” however, when invoked as a guide to judicial action, means a sound discretion, exercised with regard to what is right and in the interests of justice. And an appellate court is not bound to stay its hand and place its stamp of approval on a case when it feels that injustice may result. Quite to the contrary, it is definitely recognized in numerous decisions that an abuse of discretion is an exception to the rule that the granting or refusing of a new trial is not assignable as error.</p>
</div>
<p id="c0e34402-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus an appellate court must still rule upon the propriety of an order for a new trial, even though the grounds for reversal are exceedingly narrow. But before any rational decision can be made, the reviewing court must know what standards the trial judge is bound to apply when ruling upon a motion for a new trial. These standards necessarily vary according to the grounds urged in support of the new trial. There is, however, little authority on what standards are to be applied in ruling on a motion for new trial on the grounds that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence beyond the simple maxim that the trial judge has wide discretion. The few available <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="645" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page645">p. 645</span>authorities are conflicting. Professor Moore concludes that while the trial judge has a responsibility for the result at least equal to that of the jury he should not set the verdict aside as contrary to the weight of the evidence and order a new trial simply because he would have come to a different conclusion if he were the trier of the facts. Professor Moore states in this connection:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0e36b13-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[S]ince the credibility of witnesses is peculiarly for the jury it is an invasion of the jury’s province to grant a new trial merely because the evidence was sharply in conflict. The trial judge, exercising a mature judicial discretion, should view the verdict in the overall setting of the trial; consider the character of the evidence and the complexity or simplicity of the legal principles which the jury was bound to apply to the facts; and abstain from interfering with the verdict unless it is quite clear that the jury has reached a seriously erroneous result. The judge’s duty is essentially to see that there is no miscarriage of justice. If convinced that there has been then it is his duty to set the verdict aside; otherwise not.</p>
</div>
<p id="c0e36b14-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professor Moore’s views are logical and persuasive and buttressed by some decisional authority. . . . </p>
<p id="c0e36b15-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What we have stated demonstrates that there is no consensus of opinion as to the exact standards to be used by a trial court in granting a new trial and that the criteria to be employed by an appellate tribunal charged with reviewing the trial judge’s decision in this respect are equally indefinite. New trials granted because (1) a jury verdict is against the weight of the evidence may be sharply distinguished from (2) new trials ordered for other reasons: for example, evidence improperly admitted, prejudicial statements by counsel, an improper charge to the jury or newly discovered evidence. In the first instance given it is the jury itself which fails properly to perform the functions confided to it by law. In the latter instances something occurred in the course of the trial which resulted or which may have resulted in the jury receiving a distorted, incorrect, or an incomplete view of the operative facts, or some undesirable element obtruded itself into the proceedings creating a condition whereby the giving of a just verdict was rendered difficult or impossible. In the latter instances, (2), supra, the trial court delivered the jury from a possibly erroneous verdict arising from circumstances over which the jury had no control. Under these conditions there is no usurpation by the court of the prime function of the jury as the trier of the facts and the trial judge necessarily must be allowed wide discretion in granting or refusing a new trial.</p>
<p id="c0e36b16-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But where no undesirable or pernicious element has occurred or been introduced into the trial and the trial judge nonetheless grants a new trial on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, the trial judge in negating the jury’s verdict has, to some extent at least, substituted his judgment of the facts and the credibility of the witnesses for that of the jury. Such an action effects a denigration of the jury system and to the extent that new trials are granted the judge takes over, if he does not usurp, the prime function of the jury as the trier of the facts. It then becomes the duty of the appellate tribunal to exercise a closer degree of scrutiny and supervision than is the case where a new trial is granted because of some undesirable or pernicious influence obtruding into the trial. Such a close scrutiny is required in order to protect the litigants’ right to jury trial.</p>

A prime example of subject matter lying well within the comprehension of jurors is presented by the circumstances at bar.</p>

We must conclude that the jury did believe this testimony and that the court below substituted its judgment for that of the jury on this issue and thereby abused its legal discretion.</p>

<p id="c0e36b1c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under [the traditional understanding of trial courts’ power to grant new trials] the only function of a reviewing court, once the trial court has ordered a new trial, is to see whether there can have been any basis in reason for the trial judge’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence and the injustice of the verdict. The majority do not challenge this view, though they do not state explicitly what their understanding of our role is.</p>
<p id="c0e36b1d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The present record discloses a sharp conflict of testimony whether Kaufman, the metropolitan sales manager, ever promised plaintiff, his subordinate district manager, a 1% commission on all gross sales of agents working under plaintiff. There are several remarkable aspects of this alleged promise which could reasonably have influenced the trial judge on this decisive issue. This commission would have more than quadrupled plaintiff’s salary of $150 per week, making him much higher paid than his immediate superior, Kaufman, or any other company executive, except the president. No other sales manager or supervisor received any such commission at all. Moreover, after the alleged promise was made, month after month elapsed with no payment of the 1% commission or indication of any step to fulfill such an obligation. Yet plaintiff himself admits that he made no formal demand for or inquiry about the large obligation for several years, and said nothing even informally about it to anyone for many months save for an occasional passing verbal inquiry said to have been addressed to Kaufman. The trial court may have reasoned that the amount said to have been promised was so abnormally large and plaintiff’s concern about nonpayment so unnaturally small as to make it incredible that the promise ever was made. In addition, the very vagueness of the alleged promise and the absence of any mention of time in it may have increased the incredulity of the judge who heard the evidence.</p>

<li class=""><p id="c0e39236-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why? If the trial judge granted defendant judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) that would end the case. Why bother also ruling on a motion for a new trial? Rule 50(c) contains the answer, permitting a party making a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law to make a conditional motion for a new trial, and requiring the court to rule on that conditional motion if she grants the Rule 50(b) motion. This conditional ruling comes into play only if “the judgment [notwithstanding the verdict] is later vacated or reversed.” <i>Lind</i> illustrates the need for such a conditional ruling because the judgment as a matter of law was in fact reversed. Without Rule 50(c), the defendant would have had to return to the trial court and, perhaps some years after the trial, make its motion for a new trial, long after perhaps-critical details had faded from the trial judge’s memory. Rule 50(c) allows the trial judge to rule on all post-trial motions with the case still fresh in mind and allows the appellate court to consider all of them at once—as it did in <i>Lind</i>. You can see the U.S. Supreme Court endorsing this reasoning toward the end of the opinion in <i>Unitherm Food Systems, Inc. v. Swift-Eckrich, Inc</i>. (supra page 637).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c0e39237-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notice that while the grant of a judgment as a matter of law constitutes a final judgment from which an appeal may be taken, the grant of a new trial, standing alone, does not create a final judgment—there will be no final judgment until after completion of the new trial. Accordingly, a party cannot <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="648" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page648">p. 648</span>appeal the grant of a new trial until after the second trial has occurred!

The judge, believing that the evidence strongly favored the plaintiff, orders a new trial. The second jury agrees with the first. Should the judge order still a third trial or simply conclude that he was wrong about the weight of the evidence? Because the new trial order is not appealable, the length of such a sequence is theoretically indefinite. Worry not: In practice, one of four things is likely to happen: The judge may finally get a jury that agrees with him, or the judge may decide that the juries were right and he was wrong. If neither of these occurs, the parties may well decide to settle rather than continue pouring money into repeated trials. Or, finally, defendant might eventually get an appellate court to grant a writ of mandamus (see infra page 689) to put him out of his misery.</p></li>

Consider a judge who concludes that the jury reasonably could have reached a verdict for the plaintiff but that its damage calculations are unreasonably low or high. May the judge grant a new trial limited to the issue of damages? The answer is yes, though the problems involved in reaching that answer are considerable.</p>

<p id="c0e3b94e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider the logical underpinnings of such a ruling. To be prepared to order a new trial limited to the issue of damages, the judge must be convinced that whatever influences led the jury astray on damages did not infect the judgment on liability as well. Take, for example, a verdict for the plaintiff combined with clearly insufficient damages. Can the judge be certain that the low award did not reflect considerable jury uncertainty that the plaintiff should recover at all—uncertainty that should have been reflected in a verdict for the defendant? The same doubt can exist in the case of clearly excessive damages; a jury passionately disposed toward the plaintiff regarding damages may have been so influenced on the issue of liability as well.</p>
<p id="c0e3b94f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet courts do order such partial new trials. Pingatore v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., 419 F.2d 1138 (6th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 398 U.S. 928 (1970), serves as an example. A rat leapt on and bit plaintiff’s knee while she was leaving a department store’s premises. She developed complications leading to partial paralysis in an arm and leg. Testimony divided over whether the damage was attributable to the treatment for the bite (a series of rabies inoculations), to “conversion hysteria” or “psychosis,” or to “malingering.” After a trial in which the plaintiff’s attorney ranted and swore at the defendant corporation, the jury awarded plaintiff $126,000 in damages and $25,000 to her husband. The court of appeals reversed <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="649" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page649">p. 649</span>the judgment on account of the plaintiff’s attorney’s misbehavior. But, without explaining more than that “there is substantial evidence to support the verdict of the jury on the question of liability,” the court limited the new trial to damages. Why was liability so clear? Because it was obvious that the plaintiff should get <i>something</i> for being bitten by a rat?</p>

<p id="c0e3b952-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Instead of ordering a new trial on damages, could the <i>Pingatore</i> court simply have reduced the amount of the damage award to one it thought reasonable? The answer is yes—under some circumstances. In such an action, known as <i>remittitur</i>, the judge orders a new trial unless the plaintiff agrees to accept reduced damages. Its damage-increasing analogue is <i>additur</i>. Both involve many of the problems inherent in the partial new trial as well as some special difficulties.</p>
<p id="c0e3b953-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the jury renders a verdict that is arguably excessive, the trial judge faces several questions. These questions apply, in reverse, to additur, the less common of the two devices. Essentially, the questions are: First, when should one grant such a reduction (or addition) in damages? And, second, how does one calculate the amount?</p>
<p id="c0e3b954-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider the choice to which the grant of remittitur puts a plaintiff. Assume a verdict of $150,000 for plaintiff that the court orders remitted to $75,000. If plaintiff refuses the remittitur, the consequence is, of course, that the court will grant a new trial. The Supreme Court has held that a plaintiff must get a choice between a new trial and accepting reduced compensatory damages. Hetzel v. Prince William County, 523 U.S. 208 (1998). What about punitive damages? In several cases (see Chapter 5), the Supreme Court has held that due process requires judicial scrutiny and reduction of some punitive damage awards. A number of courts have found that this line of cases overcomes what would otherwise be a Seventh Amendment requirement that the court give plaintiff a choice between reduced punitive damages and a new trial—plaintiff simply has to accept the reduced punitives. E.g., Johansen v. Combustion Engineering, Inc., 170 F.3d 1320 (11th Cir. 1999).</p>
<p id="c0e3b955-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose the plaintiff accepts the remittitur of compensatory damages. May she condition her acceptance on a right to appeal? If not, may the plaintiff at least raise the matter if the defendant appeals the remitted verdict? The Supreme Court has blocked the attempt of lower courts to permit appeals from conditionally accepted verdicts. According to the Court, the plaintiff had a choice: Accept the remittitur or prepare for a new trial. Donovan v. Penn Shipping Co., 429 U.S. 648, 649 (1977).</p>
<p id="c0e3b956-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Are remittitur and additur constitutional? Some years ago, the Supreme Court held that additur violates the Seventh Amendment but that remittitur does not. The theory was that remittitur simply involves modifying a decision actually made by a jury—lopping off the excess—while additur involves making an award that no jury has ever made. See Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474, 483 (1935). Critics have suggested that this is a distinction without a difference, but it is still the law in federal courts. Many states permit additur as well as remittitur.</p>

<p id="c0e3b959-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What happens if the evidence admitted at trial provides some basis for finding for either side? Recall that the second half of the Seventh Amendment provides: “[N]o fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.” What does that mean? At a minimum, as we have already seen, it prevents a judge from overturning a jury verdict merely because she, as a juror, would have voted differently than the actual jury did. How much further does it restrict judicial control over jury verdicts?</p>
<p id="c0e3b95a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose the jury is properly instructed in the law, proceeds to deliberate, and then returns a verdict. Suppose the losing party’s attorney interviews all the jurors after the verdict. (Jurors have no obligation to speak with the lawyers about the case, but lawyers are interested and jurors are frequently willing.) From these interviews it appears that the jurors misunderstood the jury instructions. Suppose the jurors further say that they would have decided the case for the losing party if they had understood the instructions. Suppose the jurors go one step further, and each executes a sworn affidavit to that effect. Should the court grant judgment notwithstanding the verdict or grant a new trial to ensure a rational result under the applicable law?</p>

<p id="c0e3e071-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Peterson filed this suit in district court under 42 U.S.C. §§1983 and 1988, as well as the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution after he was fired as grant director at Texas Southern University (TSU). He claims that his property interest in his employment at TSU was damaged or destroyed when it was arbitrarily and capriciously terminated. . . . After five days of trial, conducted by the magistrate judge with the consent of the parties, the jury found for Peterson and awarded him $152,235 for lost pay and benefits and $35,000 for past and future mental anguish. Following the verdict, Wilson renewed his motion for j.m.l. and supplemented it with his bare-bones alternative motion for a new trial.</p>
<p id="c0e3e072-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some four months later, in January 1996, the district court granted the new trial, ostensibly in response to Wilson’s motion, but in actuality on its own motion: The substantive language of the district court’s order granting a new trial eschews any conclusion other than that the ruling was granted sua sponte, and that it was not granted for insufficiency of the evidence or because the jury verdict was against the great weight of the evidence, but rather for the following reason:</p>

Instead, it appears that the jury considered improper factors in reaching its verdict. Accordingly, the Court deems it in the interest of justice to grant a new trial (emphasis added).</p>

<p id="c0e3e074-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . The inference is inescapable that, to impeach the jury’s verdict, the district court relied on information gleaned from the jurors themselves during the court’s post-verdict, ex parte meeting with the jury. The court voided the verdict because, in the court’s own words, the jury “completely disregarded the Court’s instructions.” Peterson timely filed a motion for reconsideration, which the district court did not grant. The case was re-tried in June 1996, and ended in a jury verdict in favor of Wilson, rejecting Peterson’s claims. . . . </p>
<p id="c0e3e075-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The jury, as the finder of facts and the maker of all credibility calls, reached its verdict in the first trial on the basis of the following record facts and inferences.</p>
<p id="c0e3e076-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Peterson is well educated, well trained, and widely experienced in his field of concentration, which is grant administration for institutions of higher education. When Peterson joined TSU in 1983 he assumed responsibility for administering grants, principally Title III grants. In addition, he was in charge of student affairs and was responsible for determining the residency status of foreign students. Peterson also supervised finances of the university and was in charge of Institutional Research. As Title III Director, Peterson generally reported directly to the Vice President for Academic Affairs: first Clarkson, then Moore, and eventually, Wilson. The programs supported by Title III grants included faculty development, equipment purchases, and institutional research, providing millions of dollars annually for expenditures at TSU. . . . </p>
<p id="c0e3e077-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Without reiterating every detail of the relevant testimony and documents, it suffices that the evidence heard and obviously credited by the jury painted a picture of Peterson as a highly principled, apolitical, objective grant administrator who repeatedly refused to “play ball” with high ranking TSU administrators when they attempted to obtain expensive equipment for unauthorized personal use or sought to have unauthorized job positions created and funded with grant money for their special “friends.” The jury also heard and obviously credited testimony of both direct and implied threats by Wilson of adverse job actions, including firing, that Peterson was in jeopardy of incurring if, on reflection, he should fail or refuse to accede to requests that would require the unauthorized expenditure of grant funds.</p>
<p id="c0e3e078-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The termination letter of January 3, 1991, from Wilson to Peterson purported to outline nine items constituting “cause” for the firing, each of which was set forth in a report prepared and submitted on request by one Joyce Deyon with whom, it turned out, Wilson never conferred after receiving the report. Wilson testified that he accepted the report and made his judgment based on it.</p>
<p id="c0e3e079-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The jury heard testimony and saw documents which, if believed—as the jury apparently did—methodically refuted or explained away each of the nine purported causes for termination and revealed that Wilson did not even understand some of the items. The jury also heard evidence which, if credited, was sufficient to support a conclusion that the termination and its purported causes were pretext intended to cover Wilson’s retaliation and desire to accomplish his actual or implied threats of <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="652" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page652">p. 652</span>getting rid of Peterson and replacing him with a grant director who would be more of a team player, i.e., would be more amenable to funding equipment purchases and job creations for “friends” of the higher-ups in the TSU administration with grant money.</p>
<p id="c0e4068a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That the jury unquestionably credited the testimony and documentation supporting Peterson’s version of the facts and rejected Wilson’s is confirmed by the “Yes” answer to Interrogatory No. I-A, “Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that Dr. Bobby Wilson acted arbitrarily and capriciously in terminating Dr. Peterson?” In the interrogatory that followed, the jury awarded Peterson $152,235 in lost pay and benefits, and $35,000 for past and future mental anguish.</p>

<p id="c0e4068d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The district court’s succinct but cryptic, three-sentence explanation for granting a new trial demonstrates beyond question that, following the verdict, the court impermissibly met with and interrogated the jurors outside the presence of the parties and their respective counsel, and then proceeded to act in direct reliance on the jurors’ comments as though they constituted newly discovered evidence of a kind that the court could properly consider. It was not. The conclusion is inescapable that, in impeaching the jury’s verdict in this case, the district court relied on information obtained from the jurors in the court’s post-verdict, ex parte meeting with them and that, by definition, any information thus obtained had to come directly from their internal deliberations qua jurors.</p>

<p id="c0e4068f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 606(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence (F.R.E.) tightly controls impeachment of jury verdicts. This rule states, in pertinent part:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c0e40690-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Upon an inquiry into the validity of a verdict. . . . , a juror may not testify as to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the jury’s deliberations or to the effect of anything upon that or any other juror’s mind or emotions as influencing the juror to assent to or dissent from the verdict. . . . or concerning the juror’s mental processes in connection therewith, except that a juror may testify on the question whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury’s attention or whether any outside influence was improperly brought to the jury’s attention or whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror. Nor may a juror’s affidavit or evidence of any statement by the juror concerning a matter about which the juror would be precluded from testifying be received for these purposes. . . . </p>

<p id="c0e40691-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The landmark Supreme Court case on this issue is <i>Tanner v. United States</i>. After acknowledging that “[b]y the beginning of this century, if not earlier, the <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="653" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page653">p. 653</span>near-universal and firmly established common-law rule in the United States flatly prohibited the admission of juror testimony to impeach a jury verdict,” the Court observed that “Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b) is grounded in the common-law rule against admission of jury testimony to impeach a verdict and the exception for juror testimony relating to extraneous influences.” Following <i>Tanner</i>, and more closely on point, we held in <i>Robles v. Exxon Corp</i>. that receiving testimony from the jurors after they have returned their verdict, for the purpose of ascertaining that the jury misunderstood its instructions, is absolutely prohibited by F.R.E. 606(b). We underscored that holding by noting that “the legislative history of the rule unmistakably points to the conclusion that Congress made a conscious decision to disallow juror testimony as to the jurors’ mental processes or fidelity to the court’s instructions.” What is pellucid here, from the court’s own unequivocal and unambiguous words, is that the jurors’ statements to the court related directly to matters that transpired in the jury room, that these matters comprehended the mental processes of the jurors in their deliberations on the case, and that the jurors’ statements formed the foundation of the court’s impeachment of the verdict grounded in the jury’s lack of “fidelity to the court’s instructions.” We cannot conceive of an example more explicitly violative of <i>Robles</i>. . . . </p>
<p id="c0e40692-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The Court of Appeals concluded that the district court did not find that the verdict was against the great weight of the evidence and that, even if it had, such a decision was contrary to the record.] We are thus left with no choice but to reverse the district court’s grant of a new trial, vacate the court’s judgment rendered on the basis of the jury verdict in the second trial, and reinstate the results of the first trial. We therefore remand this case to the district court for entry of judgment in favor of Peterson and against Wilson in the principal sum of $187,235 ($152,235 for lost pay and benefits and $35,000 for past and future mental anguish), and for the assessment of appropriate interest and costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred by Peterson in both trials and on appeal.</p>

As you have already seen, if summary judgment and judgment as a matter of law are operating properly, only close cases—cases that could rationally be decided either way—will go to the jury. In such cases, any verdict should be sustainable. And, some would add, in such cases the soft variables that constitute the jury’s sense of justice should come into play, even when those variables are hard to justify from the lofty plane of rationalism. By preventing too close an inquiry into a jury’s decision processes, one allows these considerations some free play.</p></li>

Instead, it answers a series of questions about the evidence: “Was the defendant negligent? If so, did the defendant’s negligence cause the plaintiff’s injuries? If so, was the plaintiff also negligent? If so, did the plaintiff’s negligence in some part contribute to his injuries?” When the jury has answered all the questions—or all those that are necessary—it delivers them as the verdict. In a general verdict with interrogatories, the jury renders a general verdict but also answers particular questions.</p></li>

Gallick v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, 372 U.S. 108 (1963). As a consequence of these problems, judges, in whose discretion the decision to allow a special verdict lies, often avoid them.</p></li>

Witnesses can change their stories and an occasional surprise will appear, but a well-prepared civil trial where both sides have made effective use of discovery will not look like a “Perry Mason” episode.</p>

In drama, the trial is the end of the road: The winners rejoice; the losers slink away in shame or anger. In litigation, the trial is a rare event, but even when it occurs, it may not be the end. Perhaps because trials are so rare, parties who have been unable to resolve their differences beforehand may not do so just because a judge or jury has announced a winner.

	<p id="c0eb59db-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appeals in U.S. litigation are a booming business. Over the past 50 years, federal civil appeals have increased at a rate one and one-half times faster than the increase in lawsuits filed. This increase has come even though one may appeal only from a judgment and, as we have seen, fewer than one-third of federal civil cases end in a judgment. Moreover, this increase has come even though fewer than 10 percent of federal cases are reversed on appeal.</p>
	<p id="c0eb59dc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appeals are the setting for particularly fierce battles between two goals of civil procedure: fairness and justice. Fairness dictates that parties should win or lose depending on their compliance with procedural rules and the quality of their arguments. Justice dictates that the “right” party should prevail, regardless of such technicalities. Because the system embraces both goals, one must frequently yield to the other, and the conflict appears starkly in appellate litigation.</p>
	<p id="c0eb59dd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unlike some other legal systems, the U.S. litigation system operates with a heavy presumption that most trial court decisions are correct. U.S. appellate courts do not supervise trial courts. They do not have jurisdiction to review many trial court decisions and orders that might have been erroneously decided. And when they can review trial court decisions, they may reverse only if an error appears in the record of the trial court proceedings, only if it is an error the appealing party pointed out below, and only if the error in question is harmful—that is, if it is likely to have changed the outcome of the case.</p>
	<p id="c0eb59de-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both practical and doctrinal walls insulate trial court decisions. A word about some of the practical ones is in order. Strategic decisions can turn out to be wrong: You think you have a fine venue, so pass on an objection to it, only <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="662" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page662">p. 662</span>to find that the judge seems to hate you. Having made so many evidentiary objections that the jury is becoming irritated, you make a tactical decision to pass on one—only to find out too late that the jury thought that document fatal to your cause. Page limits for appellate briefs require you to focus on one or two erroneous rulings—perhaps passing on one that the appellate court would have found substantial. These types of strategic decisions can make or break a case but cannot be appealed if they do not involve an error by the trial court. In a particularly egregious case, a disappointed party might be able to bring a malpractice action against her attorney, but she cannot appeal the trial court’s decision on these grounds.</p>
	<p id="c0eb59df-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This chapter focuses instead on errors by the trial court, and the doctrinal walls that shield U.S. trial court decisions. It will answer three questions about the availability of review: <i>Who</i>—which persons can seek review of a trial court decision? <i>When</i>—at what moment may one appeal a trial court decision? And <i>how</i>—with what depth will an appellate court scrutinize an appealable decision?</p>
	<p id="c0eb59e0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Understanding these doctrines has two virtues. It is obviously essential for any lawyer who wants to appeal a trial court decision. It is equally important for another reason: Understanding the barriers to appellate review helps one to comprehend that, as a practical matter, the trial court’s decision will likely be the <i>only</i> decision on most procedural and substantive matters. This practical autonomy of the trial court puts great weight on the trial judge—to make the right decision—and on the lawyers—to give the trial judge all the information needed to make the right decision.</p>

	<p id="c0eb59e3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In theory, one could imagine appellate courts functioning as the supervisors of trial courts, automatically reviewing cases to assure both that the results are correct and that the trial judges are following appropriate procedures. Or one might imagine a judicial inspector general who would have the power and duty to bring to the attention of appellate courts instances in which either the process or the result of a trial court decision seems questionable. Administrative systems follow such models, and some civil law systems approximate them.</p>
	<p id="c0eb59e4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The U.S. courts do not. Even a blatantly erroneous decision may be appealed only by a party to the lawsuit; a party, that is, who has not settled. A settlement agreement will invariably prevent further litigation of a claim. So, if a defendant grudgingly agrees to a settlement because he believes the trial court wrongly denied his motion to dismiss, he loses his right to appeal that decision by settling the case. Even more striking, a losing party who has not settled may nevertheless be unable to gain appellate reversal of a clearly erroneous trial court decision. Two doctrines create this result: those that allow appeals only by parties who have suffered an adverse outcome in the case, and those that deter appeals with various penalties.</p>

	<p id="c0eb80fb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A hallmark of modern procedure is the ease with which parties can join multiple claims in a single lawsuit. This poses a problem for appellate review: If plaintiff wins on one claim but loses on others, may plaintiff appeal the unsuccessful claims? Conversely, if a defendant prevails on one of several defenses, may he appeal his loss on the others? Contemporary appellate review is result-oriented, so the answer to this question requires one to look at the relief sought by the party prevailing on one but not all claims or defenses. If the relief sought under the losing theories was identical to that awarded in the winning claim, no appeal will lie, even if the appellate court thinks the trial court erred. If, on the other hand, the rejected claim or defense would have entitled the appealing party to more or different relief—to a different judgment—then the party can appeal. One can describe the principle as the requirement of an “adverse” judgment, a judgment granting relief less than what one requested.</p>

Both allow for compensatory damages, and the municipal housing code authorizes prevailing plaintiffs to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees.

If this happens, the policy provides funds so others can complete the project. In <i>Cunningham</i>, the contractor failed to complete the project, and Aetna, the insurer, stepped in. After the dust settled (so to speak) and the project was completed with Aetna’s money, Aetna tried to recover $32,000—the amount of its loss—from the contractor. At trial Aetna presented two claims: that the contractor/insured violated its contractual obligation to indemnify Aetna for these losses; and that, without regard to the policy terms, the contractor/insured had committed fraud in applying for the policy and that Aetna’s loss was traceable to that fraud. (Aetna did not seek punitive damages on the fraud claim.) The district court found for Aetna on the contract claim but ruled that the contractor had not committed fraud. Both Aetna and the contractor appealed; an issue on appeal was which party could raise which contentions of error on appeal. Note that (1) failed construction contractors often file for bankruptcy protection from their creditors and (2) under some conditions liabilities incurred as a result of fraud are not discharged in bankruptcy.]</p>
	<p id="c0eba818-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the outset there is some doubt as to whether Aetna can appeal from the judgment which was in its favor in the amount prayed. If the relief granted was all to which Aetna was entitled, the mere fact that it was granted on one ground rather than on another would not make Aetna an aggrieved party on appeal. But amount is not the sole measure of the relief to which a party may be entitled. The judgment may have different qualities and legal consequences dependent on the claim on which it is based. At the beginning of the trial, Aetna’s counsel, in response to an inquiry from the court, frankly stated his reason for insisting on the tort claim for fraud and <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="665" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page665">p. 665</span>deceit, “Because if we get a straight contract judgment it would be dischargeable in bankruptcy.”  . . . </p>
	<p id="c0eba819-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It would be premature for us to pass upon the effect of bankruptcy on a judgment on either claim, or upon whether the finding that Cunningham’s representations were not fraudulent would be <i>res judicata</i> as to the operation of a discharge in bankruptcy. It is enough at this time for us to hold that, if Aetna was denied judgment of the quality to which it laid claim [i.e., the fraud claim], it is a party aggrieved on appeal. . . . </p>

Imagine that Retailer sues Customer for nonpayment of a bill. Customer counterclaims for breach of warranty on the product involved. The trial court enters judgment for Retailer on its claim but also awards damages to Customer on its warranty claim. Customer appeals. On appeal, Retailer will argue the correctness of the trial court’s rulings on the claim of nonpayment. Retailer may also <i>cross-appeal</i>, arguing that the court erred in upholding the counterclaim for breach of warranty against it.

The doctrine affects not only appeals but also the justiciability of the suit because mootness undercuts the existence of an actual case or controversy required by Article III of the Constitution. There are, however, numerous exceptions to the doctrine.</p>

In Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393 (1975), for example, the plaintiff challenged Iowa’s one-year residency requirement for obtaining a divorce. The lower court upheld the requirement, but during the litigation the year passed and the plaintiff became able to obtain her divorce. The Supreme Court nevertheless refused to dismiss the case as moot, reasoning that other plaintiffs would find themselves in the same situation.</p></li>
	<li class=""><p id="c0ebcf34-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mootness can also result from settlement. Suppose a case goes to judgment in the trial court and the loser appeals. While the appeal is pending, the parties settle. That settlement moots the appeal and, on being notified, the appellate court will dismiss the case without deciding the issues raised by the appeal.</p></li>

	<p id="c0ebcf37-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider the framework of <i>Aetna v. Cunningham</i> (supra page 664) once more. Suppose that at trial the insurer’s evidence of fraud consisted not of misstatements by the contractor but of his failure to disclose the extent of his debts. Some jurisdictions recognize nondisclosure as a form of fraud. Suppose the contractor’s lawyer does not object to the evidence. If the trial court enters judgment against the contractor on the fraud count, may the contractor on appeal argue that nondisclosure was not sufficient to show fraud?</p>
	<p id="c0ebcf38-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Generally not: A party must present to the trial court the contentions on which it wants rulings. Failure to do so results in waiver. A century ago the party had not only to raise the contention below but then to make a formal “exception” to the trial court ruling in order to preserve the issue for appeal. Rule 46 did away with the need for exceptions; the “party need only state the action that it wants the court to take or objects to, along with the grounds.  . . . ” The abolition of the formal requirement did not, however, abolish the doctrine of waiver.</p>
	<p id="c0ebcf39-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts try to walk a narrow path here. On one hand, they want to avoid hypertechnicality and preserve the ability to do justice. On the other hand, they want to prevent a litigant from “sandbagging” opposing counsel or the trial court—by vaguely expressing opposition to a trial court’s decision, then proceeding through trial, hoping to win on the merits but thinking it has “banked” an appellate reversal in case of a loss. The doctrine of waiver on appeal prevents such a strategy. Think about how it should apply in the circumstances in the problems below.</p>

	<p id="c0ec1d77-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both legislatures and appellate courts take ambivalent stances toward appeal. We all want to correct erroneous outcomes, but appeals take time and money and we are just as eager to discourage ill-grounded appeals. In many respects the urge to discourage fruitless appeals mirrors the struggle over ungrounded complaints: Is there a way to discourage the unmeritorious appeals without burdening meritorious ones?</p>
	<p id="c0ec1d78-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has never held that there is a constitutional right to appeal a civil case, so a jurisdiction could in theory either forbid civil appeals absolutely or, less dramatically, make all civil appeals a matter of discretion rather than of right. Most jurisdictions, though, grant the right to at least one appeal in civil cases; further appeal is often discretionary.</p>
	<p id="c0ec1d79-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although legislatures permit appeals, they sometimes try to discourage them. The U.S. Supreme Court has explored the limits of such discouragement in several cases in which state statutes put special burdens on some appeals. In Lindsey v. Normet, 405 U.S. 56 (1972), the Court invalidated a state statute that required tenants appealing an eviction judgment to post a bond twice as great as the rent expected to accrue during the appeal. By contrast, in Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co. v. Crenshaw, 486 U.S. 71 (1988), the Court rejected a challenge to a Mississippi statute that imposed a 15 percent penalty on an unsuccessful appeal of a judgment for money damages. The penalty was imposed regardless of the merits of the appeal so long as the appellate court affirmed the damages award without alteration. Bankers Life suffered a $1.6 million punitive damage judgment, which it unsuccessfully appealed, with the appellate court adding a $243,000 penalty to the judgment because the original award was affirmed. Bankers Life argued that the statute had denied it equal protection of the law “because it singles out appellants from money judgments, and because it penalizes all such appellants who are unsuccessful, regardless of the merits of their appeal.” 486 U.S. at 81. The Supreme Court rejected this contention in language that revealed its general stance toward appeals:</p>
	<div class="epub-blockquote">
	<p id="c0ec1d7a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under this Court’s equal protection jurisprudence, Mississippi’s statute is “presumed to be valid and will be sustained if the classification. . . . is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.” The state interests assertedly served by the Mississippi statute were detailed by the Mississippi Supreme Court in Walters v. Inexco Oil Co., 440 So. 2d 268 (1983). The penalty statute. . . . “expresses the state’s interest in discouraging frivolous appeals. It likewise expresses a bona fide interest in providing a measure of compensation for the successful appellee, compensation for his having endured the slings and arrows of successful appellate litigation.” In a similar vein the statute protects the integrity of judgments by discouraging appellant-defendants from prolonging the litigation merely to “squeeze a favorable settlement out of an impecunious” appellee. Also, the penalty statute “tells the litigants that the trial itself is a momentous event, the <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="671" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page671">p. 671</span>centerpiece of litigation, not just a first step weighing station en route to endless rehearings and reconsiderations.” Finally, in part because it serves these other goals, the penalty statute furthers the State’s interest in conserving judicial resources.</p>

	<p id="c0ec1d7b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Id. at 81-82. The <i>Bankers Life</i> Court distinguished <i>Lindsey</i> on the grounds that the Oregon statute in <i>Lindsey</i> arbitrarily discriminated against tenants (because it applied only to them among all appellants) and was not needed to effectuate the state’s purpose of preserving the property at issue.</p>
	<p id="c0ec1d7c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Lindsey</i> and <i>Bankers Life</i> involved “extra” appellate costs. What about ordinary costs that rest on all litigants? Can they ever be unconstitutional? In M.L.B. v. S.L.J., 519 U.S. 102 (1996), the indigent petitioner sought to appeal from a trial court order terminating her parental rights on the grounds she was unfit as a mother. To appeal the state court decision, M.L.B. would have had to pay filing and transcript fees of about $2,300. The state supreme court refused to waive the fees. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed, basing its decision on a combination of due process (“a family association so undeniably important is at stake”) and equal protection; the 6-3 majority held “that Mississippi may not withhold from M.L.B. a record of sufficient completeness to permit proper consideration of her claims.”</p>
	<p id="c0ec1d7d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lest you think that appellate costs burden only the poor, consider Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., 481 U.S. 1 (1987). Many states require appellants to post <i>supersedeas</i> bonds to prevent judgment winners from executing the trial court judgment immediately while the case is on appeal. These bonds, which allow appeal to proceed, are often posted by insurers in return for a premium that is a fraction of the bond amount. Texaco suffered a $10 billion jury verdict in a takeover fight with a business rival. Although it was at the time the fifth-largest corporation in the United States, Texaco lacked the funds to post such a bond or to pay the premium for an insurer to do so—and was consequently unable to appeal the verdict. It argued to the U.S. Supreme Court that the size of the <i>supersedeas</i> bond violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses; the Court rejected the case on jurisdictional grounds without reaching the constitutional claims. Read together, <i>Lindsey, Bankers Life</i>, <i>M.L.B.</i>, and <i>Texaco</i> suggest that some burden on appeals is constitutional, even when those burdens fall heavily on particular litigants.</p>
	<p id="c0ec1d7e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Should legal systems seek generally to discourage appeals by requiring, for example, that the loser pay the winner’s attorneys’ fees? Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure (Fed. R. App. P.) 38 permits a court of appeals to award “just damages and single or double costs to the appellee” if the appellate court “determine[s] that an appeal is frivolous.” One finds occasional invocation of this Rule, but it is used far less frequently than is Rule 11, its analogue at the district court level. A quite different sort of sanction for meritless appeals that is increasingly used by state and federal appellate courts is the summary affirmance or unpublished decision. Such orders, which go under different names in different systems, often involve denial of the right to oral argument, a decision on the briefs and record alone, and either a one-word order (“affirmed”) or a short unpublished opinion. For an example, see <i>Haddle v. Garrison</i>, supra page 374. Some would argue that such “appeals” exist in name only.</p>

	<p id="c0ec4491-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The single most significant doctrine of appellate procedure in the United States is one that purports to be only about the timing of appeal. Under 28 U.S.C. §1291, appeals can be brought only after there is a final decision by the district court (with some significant exceptions). Most, but not all, states follow a similar pattern. <i>Reise v. Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin</i>, supra page 51, shows an appellate court refusing to review the trial court’s discovery decision on this ground.</p>
	<p id="c0ec4492-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The final judgment rule affects not just the timing of appeal but its availability. To see why, consider how modern procedure has altered the center of gravity in civil litigation. Once upon a time, most trial court decisions were made at trial. In such a system, decisions were promptly reviewable because the trial resulted in a judgment from which an appeal would lie. Modern procedure changes that pattern: Discovery and the pretrial process now dominate the procedural landscape. Many rulings entered during the pretrial stage do not immediately produce final judgments; they are “interlocutory.” An interlocutory decision cannot be appealed until there is a final judgment in the case, and many cases will never have final judgments because they settle. Under such circumstances, the final judgment rule does not just defer but eliminates appellate review.</p>
	<p id="c0ec4493-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So to note is not to condemn. The unavailability of appeal may be a good thing: Appeals take time, and most are unsuccessful. The unavailability of appeal may merely make justice faster and cheaper. Alternatively, one can see it as empowering trial judges to be petty dictators who can be secure in the knowledge that most of their rulings will never reach appellate scrutiny.</p>

The next case demonstrates the consequences that a wrong guess about the first function can have on the second. A bit of context may explain why this decision embarrassed the Court at least slightly. In the mid-1970s, the law regarding discrimination involving pregnancy was in flux. Some cases had ruled that it was a form of gender discrimination banned by civil rights legislation. Other cases had said that, although only women could become pregnant, discrimination on account of pregnancy was not gender discrimination. The Supreme Court had granted certiorari on several related cases to resolve the dispute—only to discover that it could not decide one of the cases on the merits.</p>

Had respondents sought only a declaratory judgment, and no other form of relief, we would of course have a different case. But even if we accept respondents’ contention that the District Court’s order was a declaratory judgment on the issue of liability, it nonetheless left unresolved respondents’ requests for an injunction, for compensatory and exemplary damages, and for attorneys’ fees.

The order, viewed apart from its discussion of Rule 54(b), constitutes a grant of partial summary judgment limited to the issue of petitioner’s liability. Such judgments are by their term interlocutory, and where assessment of damages or awarding of other relief remains to be resolved have never been considered to be “final” within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. §1292. Thus the only possible authorization for an appeal from the District Court’s order would be pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. §1292.</p>

And that court’s holding that its jurisdiction was pursuant to §1291 makes it clear that it thought itself obliged to consider on the merits petitioner’s appeal. There can be no assurance that had the other requirements of §1292(b) been complied with, the Court of Appeals would have exercised its discretion to entertain the interlocutory appeal.</p>
	<p id="c0ec92db-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Were we to sustain the procedure followed here, we would condone a practice whereby a district court in virtually any case before it might render an interlocutory decision on the question of liability of the defendant, and the defendant would thereupon be permitted to appeal to the court of appeals without satisfying any of the requirements that Congress carefully set forth. We believe that Congress, in enacting present §§1291 and 1292 of Title 28, has been well aware of the dangers of an overly rigid insistence upon a “final decision” for appeal in every case, and has in those sections made ample provision for appeal of orders which are not “final” so as to alleviate any possible hardship. We would twist the fabric of the statute more than it will bear if we were to agree that the District Court’s order of February 20, 1974, was appealable to the Court of Appeals.</p>

This has been so since the Judiciary Act of 1789. Note, however, that the final judgment rule does not always apply—as you will learn when you encounter the “practical finality” doctrine, infra page 682.</p></li>
	<li class=""><p id="c0ecb9f6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, some states allow interlocutory appeals in a wide range of situations. New York, for example, has formally rejected the final judgment rule. Its procedural code makes appealable by right “any final or interlocutory judgment” and further specifies a series of pretrial orders from which a losing party may take immediate appeal, including such broad categories as any order that “involves some part of the merits or. . . . affects a substantial right.” N.Y. Civ. Prac. L. &amp; R. 5701. Other states may, less formally, have created substantial loopholes by manipulating the availability of the extraordinary writs of mandamus and prohibition (see infra page 689).</p></li>
	<li class=""><p id="c0ecb9f7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A salient characteristic of modern procedure is its allowance of multiple claims and parties. How has the final judgment rule adapted to this reality?</p>

	<li class=""><p id="c0ecb9f8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One option would have been to allow no appeal until after all claims of all parties had been resolved. As noted in <i>Wetzel</i>, Rule 54(b) rejects this solution: “[T]he court may direct entry of a final judgment as to one or more, but fewer than all, claims or parties only if the court expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay.” If such a judgment is entered, it becomes appealable.</p></li>
	<li class=""><p id="c0ecb9f9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 54(b) requires that the “court expressly determine[s] that there is no just reason for delay” in making the decision immediately appealable. Suppose a case involving several plaintiffs against a single defendant. The court grants summary judgment against one of the plaintiffs. Or imagine a case involving one plaintiff against several defendants in which the court grants summary judgment in favor of one defendant. If the court so certifies under Rule 54(b), the loser can immediately appeal. What should guide the judge’s <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="678" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page678">p. 678</span>discretion in deciding whether to issue a Rule 54(b) certification in such a case? There are efficiency considerations: If the potential appeal contains an issue that persists in the remaining claims, an appellate decision may clarify it before trial. Or a judge might decide to allow an interlocutory appeal on precisely the opposite grounds—that the issues involved as to the loser are entirely different from those for the remaining case—such that a decision won’t complicate the case for the remaining parties.</p></li>
	<li class=""><p id="c0ecb9fa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, suppose a more ordinary case, in which a plaintiff has several claims against a defendant—perhaps a claim of copyright infringement and several state law contract claims. The defendant wins partial summary judgment on the copyright claim, which the plaintiff would like to appeal. But the judge does not certify that claim under Rule 54(b). Can the plaintiff voluntarily dismiss the remaining claims and thus create an appealable final judgment? Held: Yes, absent evidence of intent to manipulate appellate jurisdiction. James v. Price Stern Sloan, Inc., 283 F.3d 1064 (9th Cir. 2002). Consider how a court might assess whether there was an intent to manipulate appellate jurisdiction.</p></li>

	<p id="c0ece10f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The basic argument for the final judgment rule involves a cost-benefit calculation. The costs of allowing interlocutory appeals are the costs of an unnecessary extra appeal if the trial judge turns out to have been correct. The costs of not allowing interlocutory appeals are those of an unnecessary or an unnecessarily long trial if the trial judge turns out to have been wrong.</p>
	<p id="c0ece110-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Advocates of the final judgment rule would argue that the costs of interlocutory appeal are too high. If we assume that the costs of an unnecessary extra appeal are approximately the same as the costs of an unnecessary or unnecessarily long trial, the overall costs are proportional to the number of times the trial judge is right versus the number of times he is wrong. If trial judges are right more often <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="679" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page679">p. 679</span>than they are wrong (measured by eventual reversal when appeal finally occurs), then the general policy should disfavor interlocutory appeals. In fact, trial judges are reversed far less often than they are affirmed (the federal courts report a reversal rate of between 10-20 percent), and many decisions are not even appealed. From this perspective, the general policy seems wise.</p>
	<p id="c0ece111-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those opposed to the final judgment rule might argue that some of these premises are wrong. First, trials, which require elaborate pretrial preparation, witnesses, and sometimes juries, will generally be more expensive than appeals. Second, in some undetermined number of cases, parties will abandon meritorious positions (that is, settle the case) because they cannot afford to wait for vindication on appeal. To point to the absence of appeal in such cases as evidence of a satisfactory trial is to ignore the realities of litigation.</p>
	<p id="c0ece112-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Beyond that, one can make a historical argument. Whatever one thinks of the original merits of the final judgment rule, its effect has changed dramatically with the advent of modern procedure. Before the Federal Rules (and equivalent state systems’ rules of procedure) came into effect, there were essentially two stages in litigation, pleading and trial. If a case ended at the pleading stage, appeal was immediately available. If it didn’t, trial would follow shortly, after which appeal was again available to the loser. Modern procedure, with its emphasis on discovery and a multistage pretrial process, adopts many of the main features of equity practice. Unlike the common law, equity permitted appeal from all interlocutory rulings. By adopting equity procedure but retaining the common law rule for appealability, modern process has delegated substantial amounts of unreviewable power to the trial court. That might be a good idea, but it has to be defended in light of the current structure of litigation.</p>

	<p id="c0ece115-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even when one is alert to the dire jurisdictional consequences of failure to heed the final judgment rule, it is not always easy to locate the precise point at which a judgment becomes final—or even, for that matter, to identify the judicial act that constitutes a judgment. One difficulty is that the judge’s belief that she is entering a judgment can be second-guessed by the appellate court. Recall that in <i>Wetzel</i> both parties understandably thought that the judge’s announcement that “final judgment be entered” meant what it said, but the Supreme Court ruled otherwise.</p>
	<p id="c0ece116-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider the matter from the perspective of a party wishing to appeal. The only step required to bring an appeal from a ruling of the district court is the timely filing of a notice of appeal with the clerk of the district court. Fed. R. App. P. 3(a)(1). That notice must be filed within the time allowed by Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A)—30 days for the typical appeal; 60 days for an appeal involving the United States. The issue of timing is critical because, as you have seen, the courts of appeals have repeatedly held that the time limits are jurisdictional—that is, that the court of appeals has no jurisdiction to hear the appeal if the notice of appeal is filed too late. Two provisions of 28 U.S.C. §2107 and the appellate rules slightly alleviate the problem of late filings. Section 2107 and Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6) empower the district court to extend this time for a party who did not receive notice of the entry of the judgment in question if no prejudice to other parties results. Section 2107 <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="680" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page680">p. 680</span>and Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5) also allow the district court to extend the time for filing the notice of appeal up to 30 days on a showing of “excusable neglect or good cause.”</p>
	<p id="c0ece117-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An equally serious problem confronts litigants who file their appeals <i>too early</i>. As we have seen, under 28 U.S.C. §1291, appeals lie “from all final decisions of the district courts.” By negative implication appeals do not lie from decisions of the district courts that are not final. In the distinction lies what the comments to Fed. R. App. P. 4 term “a trap for an unsuspecting litigant.” Before the Rule was amended, the trap was sprung if the appellant filed a notice of appeal after the judgment but while a post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law or new trial was pending. Until these motions are decided, the final outcome—and judgment—in the case has not occurred. A number of unfortunate would-be appellants discovered this point in sorrow-producing ways. The amended rule, Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(B), alleviates the difficulty by providing that when a party seeks to appeal from an order that would be final but for the interposition of one of these common post-trial motions, the appeal is held in abeyance until the disposition of these motions, at which point it becomes effective, thus preserving the jurisdiction of the court of appeals.</p>
	<p id="c0ece118-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even with these provisions, timing remains critical, and rulemakers have therefore tried to make the moment of judgment extremely clear. Rule 58 requires that “[e]very judgment and amended judgment must be set out in a separate document. . . . ” In United States v. Indrelunas, 411 U.S. 216 (1973), the Court said that the separate-document requirement must be “mechanically applied.” The problem is that the separate document rule applies not to litigants but to court clerks and judges. These officials don’t always do what the Rules require, and when they fail, the litigants, not the officials, suffer the consequences. As the Rules Advisory Committee noted in 2002, “This simple separate document requirement has been ignored in many cases. . . . [with the result that] there have been many and horridly confused problems under Appellate Rule 4(a).” The current version of Rule 58 tries to set guidelines for some of the worst problems.</p>

	<li class=""><p id="c0ed0834-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many statutes and a number of contracts now have fee-shifting provisions attached to them (see supra pages 349-57). Rule 54(d)(2) establishes a procedure for claiming and proving such fees. Suppose a judgment on the merits of the case has been entered, but there is a pending motion for attorney’s fees; can the losing party appeal the case? Or does the pendency of the fees motion mean that the judgment is not yet final? (Note that, in almost all cases, the answer matters because most fee disputes will take longer to resolve than the 30 days in which Fed. R. App. P. 4(a) requires that a notice of appeal must be filed.) In a pair of cases the U.S. Supreme Court has answered that question: “Whether the claim for attorney’s fees is based on a statute, a contract, or both, the pendency of a ruling on an award for fees and costs does not prevent, as a general rule, the merits judgment from becoming final for purposes of appeal.” Ray Haluch Gravel Co. v. Central Pension Fund, 134 S. Ct. 773 (2014). The consequence in the cited case was that the appellant, who had waited to appeal until the ruling on fees was entered, was far too late, and the appellate court therefore lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal.</p></li>

Petitioner Lauro Lines s.r.l., an Italian company, owns the Achille Lauro. Respondents filed suits against Lauro Lines in the District Court for the Southern District of New York to recover damages for injuries sustained as a result of the hijacking, and for the wrongful death of passenger Leon Klinghoffer. Lauro Lines moved before trial to dismiss the actions, citing the forum-selection clause printed on each passenger ticket. This clause purported to obligate the passenger to institute any suit arising in connection with the contract in Naples, Italy, and to renounce the right to sue elsewhere.</p>
	<p id="c0ed2e52-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District Court denied petitioner’s motions to dismiss, holding that the ticket as a whole did not give reasonable notice to passengers that they were waiving the opportunity to sue in a domestic forum. Without moving for certification for immediate appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1292(b), Lauro Lines sought to appeal the District Court’s orders. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit dismissed petitioner’s appeal on the ground that the District Court’s orders denying petitioner’s motions to dismiss were interlocutory and not appealable under §1291. The court held that the orders did not fall within the exception to the rule of nonappealability carved out for collateral final orders in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541 (1949). We granted certiorari to resolve a disagreement among the Courts of Appeals. We now affirm.</p>

	<p id="c0ed2e54-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Title 28 U.S.C. §1291 provides for appeal to the courts of appeals only from “final decisions of the district courts of the United States.” For purposes of §1291, a final judgment is generally regarded as “a decision by the District Court that ’ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.’” Van Cauwenberghe v. Biard, 486 U.S. 517, 521 (1988), quoting Catlin v. United States, 324 U.S. 229, 233 (1945). An order denying a motion to dismiss a civil action on the ground that a contractual forum-selection clause requires that such suit be brought in another jurisdiction is not a decision on the merits that ends the litigation. On the contrary, such an order “ensures that litigation will continue in the District Court.” <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="683" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page683">p. 683</span>Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., 485 U.S. 271, 275 (1988). Section 1291 thus permits an appeal only if an order denying a motion to dismiss based upon a forum-selection clause falls within the “narrow exception to the normal application of the final judgment rule [that] has come to be known as the collateral order doctrine.” Midland Asphalt Corp. v. United States, 489 U.S. 794, 798 (1989). That exception is for a “small class” of prejudgment orders that “finally determine claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, [and that are] too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.” <i>Cohen</i>, supra, at 546. We have held that to fall within the <i>Cohen</i> exception, an order must satisfy at least three conditions: “It must ’conclusively determine the disputed question,’ ’resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,’ and ’be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.’” Richardson-Merrell Inc. v. Koller, 472 U.S. 424, 431 (1985), quoting Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 468 (1978). For present purposes, we need not decide whether an order denying a dismissal motion based upon a contractual forum-selection clause conclusively determines a disputed issue, or whether it resolves an important issue that is independent of the merits of the action, for the District Court’s orders fail to satisfy the third requirement of the collateral order test.</p>
	<p id="c0ed2e55-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We recently reiterated the “general rule” that an order is “effectively unreviewable” only “where the order at issue involves ’an asserted right the legal and practical value of which would be destroyed if it were not vindicated before trial.’” <i>Midland Asphalt Corp</i>., quoting United States v. MacDonald, 435 U.S. 850, 860 (1978). If it is eventually decided that the District Court erred in allowing trial in this case to take place in New York, petitioner will have been put to unnecessary trouble and expense, and the value of its contractual right to an Italian forum will have been diminished. It is always true, however, that “there is value. . . . in triumphing before trial, rather than after it,” <i>MacDonald</i>, supra, at 860, n.7, and this Court has declined to find the costs associated with unnecessary litigation to be enough to warrant allowing the immediate appeal of a pretrial order. See <i>Richardson-Merrell Inc.</i>, supra, at 436 (“the possibility that a ruling may be erroneous and may impose additional litigation expense is not sufficient to set aside the finality requirement imposed by Congress” in §1291). Instead, we have insisted that the right asserted be one that is essentially destroyed if its vindication must be postponed until trial is completed.</p>
	<p id="c0ed2e56-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have thus held in cases involving criminal prosecutions that the deprivation of a right not to be tried is effectively unreviewable after final judgment and is immediately appealable. Similarly, in civil cases, we have held that the denial of a motion to dismiss based upon a claim of absolute immunity from suit is immediately appealable prior to final judgment, “for the essence of absolute immunity is its possessor’s entitlement not to have to answer for his conduct in a civil damages action.” Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 525 (1985). And claims of qualified immunity may be pursued by immediate appeal, because qualified immunity too “is an immunity from suit.” On the other hand, we have declined to hold the collateral order doctrine applicable where a district court has denied a claim, not that the defendant has a right not to be sued at all, but that the suit against the defendant is not properly before <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="684" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page684">p. 684</span>the particular court because it lacks jurisdiction. In Van Cauwenberghe v. Biard, 486 U.S. 517 (1988), a civil defendant moved for dismissal on the ground that he had been immune from service of process because his presence in the United States had been compelled by extradition to face criminal charges. We noted that, after <i>Mitchell</i>, “[t]he critical question. . . . is whether ’the essence’ of the claimed right is a right not to stand trial,” 486 U.S., at 524, and held that the immunity from service of process defendant asserted did not amount to an immunity from suit—even though service was essential to the trial court’s jurisdiction over the defendant.</p>
	<p id="c0ed2e57-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lauro Lines argues here that its contractual forum-selection clause provided it with a right to trial before a tribunal in Italy, and with a concomitant right not to be sued anywhere else. This “right not to be haled for trial before tribunals outside the agreed forum,” petitioner claims, cannot effectively be vindicated by appeal after trial in an improper forum. There is no obviously correct way to characterize the right embodied in petitioner’s forum-selection provision: “all litigants who have a meritorious pretrial claim for dismissal can reasonably claim a right not to stand trial.” <i>Van Cauwenberghe</i>. The right appears most like that to be free from trial if it is characterized—as by petitioner—as a right not to be sued at all except in a Neapolitan forum. It appears less like a right not to be subjected to suit if characterized—as by the Court of Appeals—as “a right to have the binding adjudication of claims occur in a certain forum.” Even assuming that the former characterization is proper, however, petitioner is obviously not entitled under the forum-selection clause of its contract to avoid suit altogether, and an entitlement to avoid suit is different in kind from an entitlement to be sued only in a particular forum. Petitioner’s claim that it may be sued only in Naples, while not perfectly secured by appeal after final judgment, is adequately vindicable at that stage—surely as effectively vindicable as a claim that the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant—and hence does not fall within the third prong of the collateral order doctrine.</p>
	<p id="c0ed5568-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner argues that there is a strong federal policy favoring the enforcement of foreign forum-selection clauses, citing The Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., 407 U.S. 1 (1972), and that “the essential concomitant of this strong federal policy. . . . is the right of immediate appellate review of district court orders denying their enforcement.” A policy favoring enforcement of forum-selection clauses, however, would go to the merits of petitioner’s claim that its ticket-agreement requires that any suit be filed in Italy and that the agreement should be enforced by the federal courts. Immediate appealability of a prejudgment order denying enforcement, insofar as it depends upon satisfaction of the third prong of the collateral order test, turns on the precise contours of the right asserted, and not upon the likelihood of eventual success on the merits. The Court of Appeals properly dismissed petitioner’s appeal, and its judgment is affirmed.</p>

	<p id="c0ed556b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The reason we say that the right not to be sued elsewhere than in Naples is “adequately vindicable,” by merely reversing any judgment obtained in violation of it is, quite simply, that the law does not deem the right important enough to be vindicated by, as it were, an injunction against its violation obtained through interlocutory appeal. The importance of the right asserted has always been a significant part of our <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="685" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page685">p. 685</span>collateral order doctrine. When first formulating that doctrine in <i>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp</i>. we said that it permits interlocutory appeal of final determinations of claims that are not only “separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action,” but also, we immediately added, “<i>too important</i> to be denied review” (emphasis added). Our later cases have retained that significant requirement. . . . </p>
	<p id="c0ed556c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While it is true, therefore, that the “right not to be sued elsewhere than in Naples” is not fully vindicated—indeed, to be utterly frank, is positively destroyed—by permitting the trial to occur and reversing its outcome, that is vindication enough because the right is not sufficiently important to overcome the policies militating against interlocutory appeals. We have made that judgment when the right not to be tried in a particular court has been created through jurisdictional limitations established by Congress or by international treaty. The same judgment applies—if anything, a fortiori—when the right has been created by private agreement.</p>

A competent appellate lawyer could have told the appellant that this was a very long shot, given the existing law. Why did the appellant nevertheless think it was a shot worth taking? Without knowing for sure, we offer two speculations. First, if this case ends like most, it will settle—in which case no appeal is possible. Second, the underlying events would make the cruise line extremely reluctant to try the case to a New York jury. The pirates had singled out Leon Klinghoffer, the deceased passenger, as a Jew, then shot him to death and pushed him in his wheelchair into the ocean. Klinghoffer was a New York native. The issue before the jury would be whether the cruise line had taken adequate security measures to prevent these acts. Does that explain why the appellant may have thought that the long odds of an appeal were nevertheless its best odds?</p>

Such a glance may be particularly important in a case like <i>Lauro Lines</i>. Such cases are very unlikely to go to trial, and a settlement will not be appealable. Thus, the interlocutory review of the court order is likely to be the only review. Might this be the point of Justice Scalia’s concurrence?</p>
	<p id="c0ed7c8b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Concerns about “practical finality” often arise in cases concerning the official immunity defense for government officials. Government officials sued for violating the constitutional rights of citizens have a powerful defense: “official immunity"—both absolute and qualified, as <i>Lauro Lines</i> describes. These doctrines intend not only to shield them from liability but also to shield them from the obligation to stand trial—including the necessity to endure discovery. As <i>Lauro Lines</i> recognizes, the “right not to stand trial” can only be vindicated if immediate appeal lies from a trial court order that—erroneously—holds that official immunity does not apply. See Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731 (1982) (allowing immediate appeal of trial court’s refusal to dismiss claim against President of the United States on grounds of absolute official immunity); Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511 (1985) (allowing immediate appeal of trial court’s refusal to dismiss a suit against a former United States Attorney General on qualified immunity grounds). <i>Ashcroft v. Iqbal</i> in Chapter 6 is another case that was appealed up to the Supreme Court following the denial of a motion to dismiss on qualified immunity grounds. (Note, however, that the Supreme Court’s opinion in <i>Iqbal</i> focused not on qualified immunity—the immediately appealable issue—but on pleading standards, which are not subject to collateral review.)</p>

	<p id="c0edcac8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Additional efforts to release some of the tension created by the final judgment rule are found in several statutes. The terms of 28 U.S.C. §1292(b) permit a district court to certify interlocutory appeals from non-final judgments. A district court judge wishing to create the possibility for such an interlocutory appeal must certify that the order “involves a controlling question of law as to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion” and that “an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.” For the interlocutory appeal to occur, not only must the district court judge so certify, but the appellate court must agree.</p>
	<p id="c0edcac9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statute is infrequently used. A study at the close of the 1980s, a period when overall appeals increased dramatically, revealed that out of the 40,000+ federal appeals in an average year only about 300 were certified by district courts, and of those only about one-third, 100 cases, were accepted by the courts of appeals. Michael Solomine, <i>Revitalizing Interlocutory Appeals in the Federal Courts</i>, 58 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1165 (1990). Note that one of the cases you may soon read, <i>Mosley v. General Motors Corp.</i>, infra page 788, was one of those relatively few exceptions.</p>
	<p id="c0edcaca-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another approach appears in Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f). Acting under the authority granted by 28 U.S.C. §2072(c), which permits the Rules to define “when a ruling of a district court is final for purposes of appeal,” Rule 23(f) now provides: “A court of appeals may permit an appeal from an order granting or denying class-action certification under this rule if a petition for permission to appeal is filed with the circuit clerk within fourteen days after the order is entered.” The district court need not agree. Do you think §1292(b) should be amended in a similar fashion?</p>

	<p id="c0edcacd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A <i>writ of mandamus</i> is not quite an interlocutory appeal, but it has a similar function. A party seeking a writ of mandamus essentially brings suit in an appellate court against the trial judge in the case, seeking an order that that judge perform an act required by law. For example, in LaBuy v. Howes Leather, 352 U.S. 249 (1957), where the district court had declined to try an antitrust case, instead referring it to a special master, the defendants sought a writ of mandamus from the court of appeals, ordering the district court to try the case. The court of appeals issued the writ and the writ was upheld by the Supreme Court. The Seventh Circuit had previously expressed its displeasure with referral of such cases to masters, and the Supreme Court was even more emphatic in describing the district court’s action as an “abdication of the judicial function.” The difficulty with mandamus arises because it can become a tempting route for the avoidance of the rules against interlocutory appeals explored in the preceding material. To prevent this evasion of the final judgment rule, the availability of the writ must be limited, as courts regularly remind:</p>
	<div class="epub-blockquote">
	<p id="c0edf1de-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The remedy of mandamus is a drastic one, to be invoked only in extraordinary situations. As we have observed, the writ “has traditionally been used in the federal courts only ’to confine an inferior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="690" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page690">p. 690</span>to compel it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to do so.’” And, while we have not limited the use of mandamus by an unduly narrow and technical understanding of what constitutes a matter of “jurisdiction,” the fact still remains that “only exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial ’usurpation of power’ will justify the invocation of this extraordinary remedy.”</p>

	</div>
	<p id="c0edf1e0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In spite of such limitations, one does find cases where appellate courts are prepared to issue writs of mandamus. One area in which mandamus seems freely available, with little discussion of the usual stated limitations, is that in which the trial judge has denied a jury trial. Thus, in Beacon Theatres v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500 (1959) (granting a writ of mandamus and ordering a jury trial in a case combining legal and equitable claims), the propriety of interlocutory appellate review was largely assumed. Another exception to the general stinginess of the courts in issuing the writ is to prevent the transfer of a case, under 28 U.S.C. §1404(a), out of the circuit. The rationale is that the statutory basis for the writ, 28 U.S.C. §1651, authorizes writs to be issued by courts “in aid of their respective jurisdictions.” Because a transfer out of the circuit would deprive the court of appeals of its eventual jurisdiction on appeal, the appellate court has jurisdiction to consider the propriety of such a transfer order. The Seventh Circuit has adopted an apparently unique use of mandamus. In seeking the recusal of judges under 28 U.S.C. §455(a) (on the broad ground that “impartiality might reasonably be questioned”), that Circuit requires parties to use mandamus rather than appeal. The Circuit’s theory is that in such broadly based recusal motions, an aggrieved party who waits to appeal until after trial will have great difficulty demonstrating an effect on his “substantial rights.” As you will see in the next section, only an effect on “substantial rights” can constitute reversible error; therefore, in order to create some avenue by which denial of a §455(a) motion can be reviewed, mandamus is available. However tortured the Seventh Circuit’s reasoning, the result makes sense: In most cases mandamus on these grounds will be sought early in the case, before time has been wasted on proceedings that must be set aside.</p>

The principal issue in <i>Schlagenhauf</i> was whether the district court could order a series of mental and physical examinations of a defendant bus driver whose bus had collided with another vehicle that he later claimed he did not see. The Supreme Court ruled that, of the numerous examinations ordered by the district court, only the eye examination was justified. The court of appeals had refused to issue a writ of mandamus ordering the district court to rescind its order for the additional examinations. One would therefore expect the Supreme Court to remand to the court of appeals for it to issue the writ of mandamus. Instead, the Court remanded the case to the district court for proceedings consistent with its opinion. (The Court did not note that the mandamus action before it, being an original action in the court of appeals, could not be remanded to the district court and that the original action was still in the district court.)</p></li>

	<p id="c0ee8e3e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because a finding of intentional discrimination is a finding of fact, the standard governing appellate review. . . . is that set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a): “Findings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.”  . . . </p>
	<p id="c0ee8e3f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the meaning of the phrase “clearly erroneous” is not immediately apparent, certain general principles. . . . may be derived from our cases. The foremost of these principles, as the Fourth Circuit itself recognized, is that a “finding is ’clearly erroneous’ when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.” United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395 (1948). . . . Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder’s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.</p>
	<p id="c0ee8e40-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is so even when the district court’s findings do not rest on credibility determinations, but are based instead on physical or documentary evidence or inferences from other facts. To be sure, various Courts of Appeals have on occasion asserted the theory that an appellate court may exercise de novo review over findings not based on credibility determinations. . . . </p>
	<p id="c0ee8e41-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rationale for deference to the original finder of fact is not limited to the superiority of the trial judge’s position to make determinations of credibility. The trial judge’s major role is the determination of fact, and with experience in fulfilling that role comes expertise. Duplication of the trial judge’s efforts in the court of appeals would very likely contribute only negligibly to the accuracy of fact determination at a huge cost in diversion of judicial resources. . . . As the Court has stated in a different <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="694" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page694">p. 694</span>context, the trial on the merits should be “the ’main event’. . . . rather than a ’tryout on the road.’” Wainwright v.

The District Court’s finding was based on essentially undisputed evidence regarding the respective backgrounds of petitioner and Mr. Kincaid and the duties. . . . of Recreation Director. The District Court, after considering the evidence, concluded that the position. . . . carried with it broad responsibilities for creating and managing a recreation program involving not only athletics, but also other activities for citizens of all ages and interests. The court determined that petitioner’s more varied educational and employment background and her extensive involvement in a variety of civic activities left her better qualified to implement such a rounded program. . . . </p>
	<p id="c0ee8e44-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Fourth Circuit, reading the same record, concluded that the basic duty of Recreation Director was to implement an athletic program. . . . Accordingly, it seemed evident to the Court of Appeals that Mr. Kincaid was in fact better qualified than [Ms. Anderson].</p>
	<p id="c0ee8e45-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Based on our reading of the record, we cannot say that either interpretation of the facts is illogical or implausible. Each has support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record. . . . The question we must answer, however, is not whether the Fourth Circuit’s interpretation of the facts was clearly erroneous, but whether the District Court’s finding was clearly erroneous. . . . </p>
	<p id="c0ee8e46-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Somewhat different concerns are raised by the Fourth Circuit’s treatment of the District Court’s finding that petitioner, alone among the applicants. . . . , was asked questions regarding her spouse’s feelings. . . . Here the error of the Court of Appeals was its failure to give due regard to the ability of the District Court to interpret and discern the credibility of oral testimony. . . . The Court of Appeals rested its rejection of the District Court’s finding. . . . on its own interpretation of testimony by Mrs. Boone. . . . </p>

We therefore cannot agree that the judge’s conclusion that the remark was facetious was clearly erroneous. . . . </p>
	<p id="c0eedc7a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Fourth Circuit’s refusal to accept the District Court’s finding that the committee members were biased against hiring a woman was based to a large extent on its rejection of the finding that petitioner had been subjected to questioning that the other applicants were spared. Given that that finding was not clearly erroneous, the finding of bias cannot be termed erroneous. . . . </p>
	<p id="c0eedc7b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our determination that the findings of the District Court regarding petitioner’s qualifications, the conduct of her interview, and the bias of the male committee members were not clearly erroneous leads us to conclude that the court’s finding that petitioner was discriminated against on account of her sex was also not clearly erroneous. . . . </p>
	<p id="c0eedc7c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In so holding, we do not assert that our knowledge of what happened 10 years ago in Bessemer City is superior to that of the Court of Appeals; nor do we claim to have greater insight than the Court of Appeals into the state of mind of the men on the selection committee. . . . Even the trial judge, who has heard the witnesses directly. . . . cannot always be confident that he “knows” what happened. Often, he can only determine whether the plaintiff has succeeded in presenting an account of the facts that is more likely to be true than not. Our task—and the task of appellate tribunals generally—is more limited still: we must determine whether the trial judge’s conclusions are clearly erroneous. On the record before us, we cannot say that they are. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>

	<li class=""><p id="c0ef0395-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s holding might rest on the empirical belief that the trial judge is more likely than an appellate court to be correct in his judgments about which witnesses are telling the truth. If so, then the holding could be challenged by a showing that people in general, even judges, are in fact rather bad at detecting lies, even when they see the witness face to face. There is some empirical evidence that many people lack the capacity to detect untruth. Indeed, that same evidence suggests that people are <i>better</i> at detecting lies when they read a transcript than when they hear and see the witnesses. Guy Wellborn, <i>Demeanor</i>, 76 Cornell L. Rev. 1075 (1991) (reviewing a substantial body of essentially unanimous social science literature). If the clearly erroneous rule rests on such an empirical belief, it is itself clearly erroneous.</p></li>
	<li class=""><p id="c0ef0396-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alternatively, the holding may have a different justification. Under Rule-driven procedure, cases that get to trial will have evidence supporting both sides; otherwise summary judgment would have occurred. So in such cases a rational trier of fact could come down on either side. Notwithstanding this uncertainty, a judgment has to be rendered. Precisely because of this uncertainty, it makes sense to adopt the view of the first hearer of the case unless there is powerful reason for thinking him wrong. Perhaps that is what the “clearly erroneous” rule is about.</p></li>

	<li class=""><p id="c0ef0397-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 52(a)(6) now codifies one of <i>Anderson</i>’s points: “Findings of fact, <i>whether based on oral or other evidence</i>, must not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.” (Emphasis added.)</p></li>
	<li class=""><p id="c0ef2aa8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many decisions are up to the sound discretion of the trial judge: Think of how many sections of the Rules say “may” rather than “must.” Appellate courts can review such decisions for abuse of discretion. As in <i>Anderson</i>’s insistence that factual findings be reversed only if clearly erroneous, the Supreme Court has expressed its impatience with appellate courts that “cheat” on the abuse-of-discretion standard by applying it too stringently. In General Electric v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136 (1997), a trial court had refused to allow some expert witnesses to testify. Such decisions are within the court’s discretion. The Eleventh Circuit reversed, citing a generalized preference for admissibility, and conceding that it was applying a particularly stringent standard of review. The Supreme Court reversed, ordering that the usual abuse-of-discretion standard be applied.</p></li>
	<li class=""><p id="c0ef2aa9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a jury rather than a judge has found the fact in question, the principle of <i>Anderson</i>, or even a more stringent standard, may be constitutionally required. The “reexamination clause” of the Seventh Amendment provides that “no fact, tried by a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of common law.” The Supreme Court has said that this clause permits trial court scrutiny of jury verdicts via Rule 50 and Rule 59 motions. The Court has also suggested, however, that the same reexamination <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="697" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page697">p. 697</span>by an appellate court, because it has not been historically sanctioned, is at least doubtful. Does this suggest that jury verdicts get even more insulation than do judges’ factual findings?</p></li>
	<li class=""><p id="c0ef2aaa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In one area the Court has not only permitted but required searching appellate review of facts and their application to law: punitive damage awards. In a pair of cases, the Supreme Court held that due process requires (a) that a state or federal appellate court must review a jury award of punitive damages, Honda Motor Co. v. Oberg, 512 U.S. 415 (1994); and (b) that the appellate review must be de novo, Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc., 532 U.S. 424 (2001), thus stripping both jury and trial judge of the deference granted to such fact-finding and law-application.</p></li>
	<li class=""><p id="c0ef2aab-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Anderson</i> deals with one side of the law-fact distinction, holding that findings of fact are entitled to a deferential standard of review. The other side of that distinction is equally important: the proposition that trial court conclusions of law are not entitled to any deference. What does it tell us about the function of appellate review that a trial court may be “a little wrong” about facts, but not about law?</p></li>

	<p id="c0ef51c9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To state a claim under §1983, a plaintiff must allege (1) that the defendant acted under color of state law, and (2) that the alleged conduct deprived the plaintiff of a constitutionally protected federal right.</p>
	<p id="c0ef51ca-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Van Zee claims that Hanson’s conduct violated his right of privacy under the Fourteenth Amendment. “[T]o violate the constitutional right of privacy the information disclosed must be either a shocking degradation or an egregious humiliatio. . . . , or a flagrant bre[a]ch of a pledge of confidentiality which was instrumental in obtaining the personal information.” Cooksey v. Boyer, 289 F.3d 513, 516 (8th Cir. 2002) (internal quotation omitted). “To determine whether a particular disclosure satisfies this exacting standard, we must examine the nature of the material. . . . to assess whether the person had a legitimate expectation that the information would remain confidential while in the state’s possession.” Eagle v. Morgan, 88 F.3d 620, 625 (8th Cir. 1996). The district court concluded that Van Zee lacked a legitimate expectation of privacy in his juvenile records due to his signed release forms, and that Hanson’s disclosure was neither shockingly degrading nor egregiously humiliating.</p>
	<p id="c0ef51cb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Van Zee argues that because the pleadings do not include his release forms, the district court’s reliance on them converted Hanson’s motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment, without permitting him the opportunity to respond. “If, on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6. . . . , matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d). “All parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present all the material that is pertinent to the motion.” <i>Id.</i> “[C]onstructive notice that the court intends to consider matters outside the complaint can be sufficient.” Country Club Estates, L.L.C. v. Town of Loma Linda, 213 F.3d 1001, 1005 (8th Cir. 2000). “Consideration of matters outside the pleading is harmless where the nonmoving party had an adequate opportunity to respond to the motion and material facts were neither disputed nor missing from the record.” BJC Health Sys. v. Columbia Cas Co., 348 F.3d 685, 688 (8th Cir. 2003) (internal quotation omitted).</p>
	<p id="c0ef51cc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Van Zee had (at least) constructive notice that the district court intended to consider matters outside the complaint when the court, by memorandum to counsel in August 2009, requested copies of any release forms Van Zee signed when enlisting in the Army. Van Zee’s counsel responded, forwarding copies of Van Zee’s signed forms. <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="699" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page699">p. 699</span>The court dismissed Van Zee’s complaint in February 2010.

	<p id="c0ef51cd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to Van Zee, the district court deprived him of the opportunity to dispute whether Hanson received a copy of the release, and if so, the legal effect of it. While these issues might affect whether Hanson committed a common-law tort or violated South Dakota law, they have no effect on whether she violated Van Zee’s Fourteenth Amendment rights. To demonstrate a breach of privacy amounting to a constitutional violation, Van Zee must allege facts showing a legitimate expectation that his juvenile records would not be disclosed to the recruiter. Van Zee does not dispute that he told the recruiter he had a juvenile record and signed forms requesting the release of his juvenile records to the recruiter. The undisputed facts indicate Van Zee expected his juvenile records to be disclosed as part of his background check. Any Rule 12(d) error committed by the district court was harmless. . . . </p>

Under 28 U.S.C. §1291 the courts of appeals have jurisdiction only to hear appeals from final judgments; 28 U.S.C. §1292(a)(1) expands that jurisdiction to make certain interlocutory judgments—including either the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction or similar order—immediately appealable. The remaining choices all result in non-final orders that would not be appealable until a final judgment in the case.</p>

A is incorrect because the outcome—the quantum of damages—on the implied warranty theory is the same as for the express warranty; Customer therefore did not suffer an adverse judgment: He got exactly what he would have gotten had he prevailed on the implied warranty theory. D is incorrect, because only a party who suffers an “adverse” judgment—one that yielded a worse result than he was arguably entitled to—can appeal. B is correct because the Retailer did suffer an adverse judgment. C is correct because the measure of damages on the misrepresentation claim might be greater than on the warranty claims (given the availability of punitive damages for the misrepresentation claim), and to that extent Customer suffered an adverse outcome.</p>

A is wrong because findings of fact, whether made by a judge or jury, are protected by the clearly erroneous standard (see Rule 52(a)(6) and <i>Anderson v. Bessemer City</i>, supra page 692). D is wrong because reviewing courts hold trial courts to a higher standard on questions of law than for those of fact: A trial court that gets a salient legal standard wrong will be reversed, even if it’s just a “little” wrong, unless the error had no effect on the outcome of the case.</p>

D is correct because the Rules drafters have provided this as an alternate route designed to protect litigants from judges who fail to carry through by providing the “separate document” embodying the judgment.

	<p id="c0f3228b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Procedural rules serve two masters. They aim to air disputes completely and to reach an accurate and just outcome. They also seek to end disputes—even if the resting condition is less than optimal. Writers sometimes loftily describe this second goal as “finality” or “repose.” Several branches of law serve the goal of finality. Statutes of limitations bar litigation that begins too late. Precedent limits dispute about governing legal principles. And appellate courts have only limited power to overturn trial court findings. This chapter focuses on two other common law doctrines that serve to bring lawsuits to an end: <i>claim preclusion</i> and <i>issue preclusion</i>.</p>
	<p id="c0f3228c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both doctrines form part of the broader topic of <i>former adjudication</i>—the effect of judgments on subsequent litigation. These doctrines answer a pair of related questions: What does it mean for a lawsuit to be over? What does a concluded lawsuit decide? Suppose, for instance, that Pamela sues Donald for injuries sustained in an auto accident, and the case goes to a final judgment. The loser can, of course, appeal. But can there be a second lawsuit? For example, may Pamela bring a second suit concerning the same accident, this time seeking recovery for damage to her automobile? Today most courts would say no, based on claim preclusion. See, for example, <i>Ison v. Thomas</i>, in Chapter 1 (supra page 48). Claim preclusion forbids a party from litigating a claim that was, or could and should have been, raised in former litigation.</p>
	<p id="c0f3228d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Issue preclusion comes into play when a claim is not barred from subsequent litigation, but some issue involved in that claim was actually previously litigated. Suppose Pamela and Donald had the misfortune to become involved in a second collision the week after the first. Pamela’s suit against Donald for injuries sustained <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="704" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page704">p. 704</span>in the first accident would not prevent her from bringing suit concerning the second one. But she and Donald might find themselves prevented from relitigating issues decided in that first suit that are relevant to the second, such as whether at the time of the accidents either was required to wear glasses while driving.</p>
	<p id="c0f3228e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Much of this chapter will be devoted to exploring the conditions that enable a party to invoke issue or claim preclusion. You will find that in examining these questions courts sometimes use an older set of terminology to refer to these concepts. They refer to claim preclusion as <i>res judicata</i> and to issue preclusion as <i>collateral estoppel</i>. They also occasionally use <i>res judicata</i> to refer to the entire topic of former adjudication. The underlying ideas are identical; only the terminology varies.</p>

	<p id="c0f32291-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Claim preclusion—barring an entire second action—occurs when the case concerns the same claim as a prior action, is litigated by the same parties to the prior action, and when the first action resulted in a final judgment on the merits. In this section, we will consider the meaning of each of these phrases: “same claim,” “same parties,” “final judgment,” and “judgment on the merits.” As we do, we will explore the underlying goals of claim preclusion: efficiency, finality, and the avoidance of inconsistency.</p>

	<p id="c0f32294-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The standard doctrinal formulation says that claim preclusion bars the same claim from relitigation. Thus stated, the principle sounds both uncontroversial and obvious. In practice, matters become much more interesting because claim preclusion has two goals—the fostering of efficiency and the prevention of inconsistency. In pursuit of these goals, claim preclusion goes much further than that simple statement might suggest.</p>
	<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead" id="c0f32295-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d">

	<p id="c0f32297-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Claim preclusion grows from pleading. A common law pleader could not combine different writs in a single suit. Because it seemed unfair to block a second suit if the pleader’s only mistake lay in selecting the wrong writ, common law courts precluded a plaintiff only from bringing a second claim on the same writ; the plaintiff remained free to try a different writ on the same facts.</p>
	<p id="c0f32298-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The two great pleading reforms of the past 150 years, the Field Codes in the nineteenth century and the Rules in the twentieth, freed pleaders from the confines of the writs. But to the extent they thereby made pleading easier, they made claim preclusion broader. A pleader under the Codes or the Rules was free to combine claims resting on different legal theories and different facts. Did she <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="705" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page705">p. 705</span>therefore <i>have</i> to do so at the risk of finding them precluded? To put the problem at its most extreme, under Rules 8 and 18, a pleader may state as many claims as she has against the opposing party. If she brings only one such claim, are all others forever precluded? No court has ever gone this far, but, short of this extreme, how broadly should preclusion sweep? In the next case the court contrasts two answers to that question.</p>

	<p id="c0f349ae-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The City of Vandalia is fairly small (the population is less than 2,500), and apparently its police have maintained informal ways. When Charles Frier parked one of his cars in a narrow street, which forced others to drive on someone else’s lawn to get around Frier’s car, the police left two notes at Frier’s house asking him to move the car. That did not work, so an officer called a local garage, which towed the car back to the garage. The officer left a note, addressed to “Charlie,” telling him where he could find the car. The officer did not issue a citation for illegal parking, however; he later testified that he wanted to make it easier for Frier to retrieve the car.</p>
	<p id="c0f349af-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Frier balked at paying the $10 fee the garage wanted. He also balked at keeping his cars out of the street. The police had garages tow four of them in 1983—a 1963 Ford Falcon, a 1970 Plymouth Duster, a 1971 Opal GT, and a 1971 Dodge van. Instead of paying the garages, Frier filed suits in the courts of Illinois seeking replevin. Each suit named as defendants the City of Vandalia and the garage that had towed the car.</p>
	<p id="c0f349b0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of the suits (which sought to replevy two cars) was dismissed voluntarily when Frier got his cars back. We do not know whether he paid for the tows and the subsequent daily storage fees or whether the garage thought it cheaper to surrender the cars than to defend the suit. The other two cases were consolidated and litigated. The police testified to the circumstances under which they had called for the tows. The court concluded that the police properly took the cars into the City’s possession to remove obstructions to the alley, and it declined to issue the writ of replevin because the City had the right to remove the cars from the street. Frier then retrieved another car;<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100A3_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N100A3_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">1</a></span> so far as we can tell, a garage still has the 1970 Plymouth Duster.</p>
	<p id="c0f349b2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After losing in state court, Frier turned to federal court. His [federal] complaint maintained that the City had not offered him a hearing either before or after it took the cars and that it is the “official policy” of the City not to do so. The complaint invoked the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. §1983, and it sought equitable relief in addition to $100,000 in compensatory and $100,000 in punitive damages. The district court, after reviewing the transcript of the replevin action, dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted. (Because the judge considered the transcript he should have treated the <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="706" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page706">p. 706</span>motion to dismiss as one for summary judgment. We analyze the decision as if he had done so.) The court found that Frier had notice of each tow and knew how to get his cars back. Frier also had a full hearing in the replevin action on the propriety of the tows. Although the judicial hearing came approximately one month after the tows, the court thought the delay permissible.</p>
	<p id="c0f349b3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A month is a long wait for a hearing when the subject is an automobile. The automobile is “property” within the meaning of the Due Process Clause, and the City therefore must furnish appropriate process. Sutton v. City of Milwaukee, 672 F.2d 644 (7th Cir. 1982), holds that a hearing is not necessary before the police tow a car but suggests that one must be furnished promptly after the tow. <i>Sutton</i> also suggests, in line with many other cases, that the City must establish the process and tender an opportunity for a hearing; it may not sit back and wait for the aggrieved person to file a suit.</p>
	<p id="c0f349b4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The City, for its part, maintains that a few isolated tows without hearings are not the “policy” of the City and may not be imputed to it, and that anyway a month’s delay in holding a hearing about seized property is permissible. . . . </p>
	<p id="c0f349b5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A court ought not resolve a constitution[al] dispute unless that is absolutely necessary. Here it is not. Frier had his day in court in the replevin action. The City has argued that this precludes further suits. (The City raised this argument in the motion to dismiss, which is irregular but not fatally so. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c).) The district court bypassed this argument because, it believed, Frier could not have asserted his constitutional arguments in a replevin action. This is only partially correct.</p>
	<p id="c0f349b6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Frier could not have obtained punitive damages or declaratory relief in a suit limited to replevin. But he was free to join one count seeking such relief with another seeking replevin. See Welch v. Brunswick Corp., 10 Ill. App. 3d 693 (1st Dist. 1973), revd. in part on other grounds, 57 Ill. 2d 461 (1974); Hanaman v. Davis, 20 Ill. App. 2d 111 (2d Dist. 1959), both of which allow one count seeking replevin to be joined with another count seeking different relief. As we show below, the law of Illinois, which under 28 U.S.C. §1738 governs the preclusive effect to be given to the judgment in the replevin actions, see Marrese v. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 470 U.S. 373 (1985), would bar this suit. The City therefore is entitled to prevail on the ground of claim preclusion, although the district court did not decide the case on that ground. See Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Ludwig, 426 U.S. 479 (1976).</p>
	<p id="c0f349b7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Illinois recognizes the principles of claim preclusion (also called <i>res judicata</i> or estoppel by judgment). Jones v. City of Alton, 757 F.2d 878, 884-85 (7th Cir. 1985) (summarizing the law of preclusion in Illinois). One suit precludes a second “where the parties and the cause of action are identical.” “Causes of action are identical where the evidence necessary to sustain a second verdict would sustain the first, i.e., where the causes of action are based upon a common core of operative facts.” Two suits may entail the same “cause of action” even though they present different legal theories, and the first suit “operates as an absolute bar to a subsequent action. . . . ‘not only as to every matter which was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but as to any other admissible matter which might have been offered for that purpose.’”  . . . </p>

City of Alton</i>, where procedural obstacles impeded litigation of the federal claim). The actions also involve both the same “common core of operative facts” and the same transactions. Frier argues that the City towed his cars wrongfully. Each complaint seeking replevin asserted [that] Frier owned each car and that it had not been “seized under lawful process”—in other words, that there had been no citation and no hearing at which anyone had found that the cars were illegally parked. The replevin statute requires a plaintiff to show that the property was taken without “lawful process.” Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 110, §19-104. “Process,” even in its technical sense, initiates or follows a hearing. Had there been process and a hearing at which a magistrate found the cars to have been illegally parked, Frier would have had no claim for replevin no matter how strongly he contested the substantive issue. The “operative facts” in the replevin and §1983 actions therefore are the same. Frier urges that he owned the car (the property interest) and that the City did not offer him a hearing to adjudicate the legality of his parking (the absence of due process).</p>
	<p id="c0f349ba-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The replevin actions diverged from the path of this §1983 suit only because the state judge adjudicated on the merits the propriety of the seizures. Having found the seizures proper, the judge had no occasion to determine whether the City should have offered Frier an earlier hearing. But this divergence does not mean that the two legal theories require a different “core of operative facts.”  . . . </p>
	<p id="c0f349bb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To the extent there is any doubt about this, we look. . . . to the purpose of doctrines of preclusion. Claim preclusion is designed to impel “parties to consolidate all closely related matters into one suit.” This prevents the oppression of defendants by multiple cases, which may be easy to file and costly to defend. There is no assurance that a second or third case will be decided more accurately than the first and so there is no good reason to incur the costs of litigation more than once. When the facts and issues of all theories of liability are closely related, one case is enough. Here the replevin theory contained the elements that make up a due process theory, and we are therefore confident that the courts of Illinois would treat both theories as one “cause of action.” The final question is whether it makes a difference that only two of the replevin actions went to judgment, while here Frier challenges the towing of four cars. Under Illinois law the answer is no. The defendant may invoke claim preclusion when the plaintiff litigated in the first suit a subset of all available disputes between the parties. See Baird &amp; Warner, Inc. v. Addison Industrial Park, Inc., 70 Ill. App. 3d 59 (1st Dist. 1979), which holds that a suit on three of six disputed parcels of land precludes a subsequent suit on all six. We doubt that Illinois would see difference between three lots out of six and two cars out of four.</p>

Rather than trying to squeeze a <i>res judicata</i> solution into a mold that does not fit, I would review the facts to determine whether Frier’s procedural due process claims could withstand a summary judgment motion. Because I believe the City was entitled to summary judgment, I concur in the result.</p>

	<p id="c0f370d1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In determining whether the disposition of a claim in State court precludes a subsequent suit on the same claim in federal court, the federal court must apply the State’s law of <i>res judicata</i>. Because Illinois continues to adhere to the narrow, traditional view of claim preclusion, as opposed to the broader approach codified in the Restatement (Second) of Judgments §§24, 25 (1982), I would hold that Frier’s substantive traffic law claim does not preclude this subsequent procedural due process claim. Under the more modern view of the new Restatement, all claims arising from a single “transaction”—broadly defined to include matters related in time, space, origin, and motivation—must be litigated in a single, initial lawsuit, or be barred from being raised in subsequent litigation. There was only one transaction in the case at bar: the seizure of Frier’s cars. Accordingly, Frier should have raised both his substantive and procedural objections to the seizure in one initial lawsuit.</p>
	<p id="c0f370d2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Illinois, however, has not adopted the view of the new Restatement.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1010F_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N1010F_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">1</a></span> Rather, as the majority recognizes, the Illinois courts focus on the similarities between the causes of action alleged in both suits, not on whether there is a common factual transaction. One suit precludes a second “where the parties and the cause of action are identical.” Redfern v. Sullivan, 111 Ill. App. 3d 372, 444 N.E.2d 205, 208 (1983). “Causes of action are identical where the evidence necessary to sustain a second verdict would sustain the first, i.e., where the causes of action are based upon a common core of operative facts.” Id. . . . </p>
	<p id="c0f370d4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, the common set of facts that must be shown to invoke Illinois’ doctrine of claim preclusion is defined as those facts necessary to sustain the cause of action, not as those facts that could be conveniently litigated in one lawsuit. This focus on the elements of the causes of action and the proofs at trial—rather than on the policy advantages of trying both actions in one suit—dooms any attempt to invoke claim preclusion in the case at bar. To be sure, both actions arise from the same seizure of the same cars. Yet, both the theory of recovery and focus of factual inquiry are dramatically different in each case. Frier’s replevin claim was substantive in nature; to replevy property, the claimant must show his superior possessory rights. Frier’s <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="709" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page709">p. 709</span>possessory rights turned on the legality of his parking. Because the trial court found that “the officer reasonably believed and had a right to believe that. . . . [Frier’s] vehicle obstructed the free use and passage way of that street at that time,” it concluded that, therefore, Frier did not enjoy the “superior right to possession of the property” necessary to sustain a replevin action.</p>
	<p id="c0f370d5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Frier’s procedural due process claim requires an entirely different factual showing. The legality or reasonableness of the seizure is irrelevant. Because of the “risk of error inherent in the truth-finding process,” an individual is entitled to certain procedural safeguards regardless of whether the deprivation of property was substantively justified. The focus of the inquiry, then, is the adequacy of procedures attending the seizure, not the seizure itself.</p>
	<p id="c0f370d6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority urges that Frier could have joined a separate constitutional claim to his replevin action. This precise argument was rejected in <i>Fountas</i>, 455 N.E.2d at 204. . . . Illinois law focuses on the similarities and differences between the various causes of action. That two wholly different causes of action arising out of the same transaction could be joined together as one convenient trial unit is irrelevant for the purposes of Illinois law, though this would be dispositive under the new Restatement.</p>

Frier eventually recovered two of his cars. Thus, the replevin action, and this action, concern only two of the cars. Frier could have recovered one of those cars immediately by paying a $10.00 towing fee to the owner of the service station that towed the car. However, Frier was informed that any further delay in reclaiming the car would result in a $2.50 per day storage charge. Frier was free to reclaim the other car without paying any fee. I would hold that, on the basis of these uncontested facts, the City was entitled to summary judgment against Frier’s procedural due process claim. . . . </p>

This holding would not necessarily conflict with recent decisions of other courts requiring more immediate and elaborate postdeprivation process. More elaborate process may well be required in those cases because the towing practices of the various municipalities were more burdensome on the respective petitioners: Immediate reclamation required significantly more than $10.00 and the litigants had standing to represent indigents who could afford no fee. We need not reach such troublesome issues in the case at bar.</p>
	<p id="c0f396eb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I would find, as a matter of law, no procedural due process violation under these facts. Accordingly, I concur with the majority’s decision to affirm the judgment below.</p>

While a compulsory joinder of parties rule might be desirable in certain cases, in Reid v. Spadone Machine Co., 119 N.H. 198 (1979), the court, noting that no such compulsory joinder rule exists, allowed a wife to sue for loss of consortium after her husband had won a claim for an employment-related injury.

Respondent removed the case to the United States District Court for the Central District of California on the basis of diversity of citizenship, and successfully moved to dismiss petitioner’s claims as barred by California’s 2-year statute of limitations. In its order of dismissal, the District Court, adopting language suggested by respondent, dismissed petitioner’s claims “in [their] entirety on the merits and with prejudice.”. . . . Petitioner [then]. . . . brought suit against respondent in the State Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, alleging the same causes of action, which were not time barred under Maryland’s 3-year statute of limitations. . . . Following a hearing, the Maryland state court granted respondent’s motion to dismiss on the ground of <i>res judicata</i>. . . . The [Maryland] Court of Special Appeals affirmed, holding that, regardless of whether California would have accorded claim-preclusive effect to a statute-of-limitations dismissal by one of its own courts, the dismissal by the California federal court barred the complaint filed in Maryland, since the <i>res judicata</i> effect of federal diversity judgments is prescribed by federal law, under which the earlier dismissal was on the merits and claim preclusive. . . . </p>

Rochereau, 88 U.S. 130, 135 (1875), which held that the <i>res judicata</i> effect of a federal diversity judgment “is such as would belong to judgments of the State courts rendered under similar circumstances,” and may not be accorded any “higher sanctity or effect.” Since, petitioner argues, the dismissal of an action on statute-of-limitations grounds by a California state court would not be claim preclusive, it follows that the similar dismissal of this diversity action by the California federal court cannot be claim preclusive. While we agree that this would be the result demanded by <i>Dupasseur</i>, the case is not dispositive because it was decided under the Conformity Act of 1872 [the pre-Rules legislation] which required federal courts to apply the procedural law of the forum State in nonequity cases. . . . </p>

	<p id="c0f40c4e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Implicit in this reasoning is the unstated minor premise that all judgments denominated “on the merits” are entitled to claim-preclusive effect.

	<p id="c0f40c4f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In short, it is no longer true that a judgment “on the merits” is necessarily a judgment entitled to claim-preclusive effect; and there are a number of reasons for believing that the phrase “adjudication upon the merits” does not bear that meaning in Rule 41(b). . . . </p>
	<p id="c0f40c50-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And even apart from the purely default character of Rule 41(b), it would be peculiar to find a rule governing the effect that must be accorded federal judgments by other courts ensconced in rules governing the internal procedures of the rendering court itself. Indeed, such a rule would arguably violate the jurisdictional limitation of the Rules Enabling Act: that the Rules “shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right,” 28 U.S.C. §2072(b). . . . In the present case, for example, if California law left petitioner free to sue on this claim in Maryland even after the California statute of limitations had expired, the federal court’s extinguishment of that right (through Rule 41(b)’s mandated claim-preclusive effect of its judgment) would seem to violate this limitation.</p>
	<p id="c0f40c51-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, as so interpreted, the Rule would in many cases violate the federalism principle of Erie R. Co. v.

Plumer</i>. See also <i>Guaranty Trust Co. v. York</i>. With regard to the claim-preclusion issue involved in the present case, for example, the traditional rule is that expiration of the applicable statute of limitations merely bars the remedy and does not extinguish the substantive right, so that dismissal on that ground does not have claim-preclusive effect in other jurisdictions with longer, unexpired limitation periods. Out-of-state defendants sued on stale claims in California and in other States adhering to this traditional rule would systematically remove state-law suits brought against them to federal court—where, unless other<div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="715" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page715">p. 715</span>wise specified, a statute-of-limitations dismissal would bar suit everywhere.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN102DD_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N102DD_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">1</a></span> We think the key to a more reasonable interpretation of the meaning of “operates as an adjudication upon the merits” in Rule 41(b) is to be found in Rule 41(a)[(1)(B)], which, in discussing the effect of voluntary dismissal by the plaintiff, makes clear that an “adjudication upon the merits” is the opposite of a “dismissal without prejudice”:</p>

Rochereau</i>, as petitioner contends, nor by Rule 41(b), as respondent contends, we turn to consideration of what determines the issue. Neither the Full Faith and Credit Clause, U.S. Const., <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="716" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page716">p. 716</span>Art. IV, §1, nor the full faith and credit statute, 28 U.S.C. §1738, addresses the question. By their terms they govern the effects to be given only to state-court judgments (and, in the case of the statute, to judgments by courts of territories and possessions). And no other federal textual provision, neither of the Constitution nor of any statute, addresses the claim-preclusive effect of a judgment in a federal diversity action. . . . </p>
	<p id="c0f4336c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is left to us, then, to determine the appropriate federal rule. And despite the sea change that has occurred in the background law since <i>Dupasseur</i> was decided—not only repeal of the Conformity Act but also the watershed decision of this Court in <i>Erie</i>—we think the result decreed by <i>Dupasseur</i> continues to be correct for diversity cases. Since state, rather than federal, substantive law is at issue there is no need for a uniform federal rule. And indeed, nationwide uniformity in the substance of the matter is better served by having the same claim-preclusive rule (the state rule) apply whether the dismissal has been ordered by a state or a federal court. This is, it seems to us, a classic case for adopting, as the federally prescribed rule of decision, the law that would be applied by state courts in the State in which the federal diversity court sits. See <i>Gasperini v. Ctr. for Humanities, Inc</i>. As we have alluded to above, any other rule would produce the sort of “forum-shopping. . . . and. . . . inequitable administration of the laws” that <i>Erie</i> seeks to avoid, since filing in, or removing to, federal court would be encouraged by the divergent effects that the litigants would anticipate from likely grounds of dismissal.

	<p id="c0f4336d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This federal reference to state law will not obtain, of course, in situations in which the state law is incompatible with federal interests. If, for example, state law did not accord claim-preclusive effect to dismissals for willful violation of discovery orders, federal courts’ interest in the integrity of their own processes might justify a contrary federal rule. No such conflict with potential federal interests exists in the present case. Dismissal of this state cause of action was decreed by the California federal court only because the California statute of limitations so required; and there is no conceivable federal interest in giving that time bar more effect in other courts than the California courts themselves would impose.</p>
	<p id="c0f4336e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the claim-preclusive effect of the California federal court’s dismissal “upon the merits” of petitioner’s action on statute-of-limitations grounds is governed by a federal rule that in turn incorporates California’s law of claim preclusion (the content of which we do not pass upon today), the Maryland Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that the dismissal necessarily precluded the bringing of this action in the Maryland courts.

Moreover, the Maryland court was correct in one respect. Federal courts have regularly said that involuntary dismissals under Rule 41(b) bar not only the claim pleaded but all claims arising from the transaction or occurrence behind the pleaded claim. To see the breadth of this doctrine, suppose the claim in question had arisen under federal law, the federal court had dismissed with prejudice, and the plaintiff then sought to bring a related claim under state law in a state court.

	<p id="c0f45a90-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notice something about one commonly offered justification for preclusion—that it is efficient. It certainly can be. For example, on the facts of <i>Ison v. Thomas</i>, considered in Chapter 1, it might well have saved time for George Ison to combine his property damage and personal injury claims in the same lawsuit: The witnesses, jury, and judge would have had to consider the same evidence—the defendant’s negligence, whether that negligence caused Ison’s injuries, and the extent if any of Ison’s own negligence—only once.</p>
	<p id="c0f45a91-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the facts of <i>Frier v. City of Vandalia</i> should also make us just a bit wary about accepting efficiency as the sole justification for preclusion doctrines. Would it really have been more efficient to try Charles Frier’s replevin and due process claims in the same lawsuit? Except for the fact of towing the cars, the evidence presented by the parties would overlap very little: In the replevin action, the central question would be who owned the cars; in the due process claim, the relevant inquiry would center on the circumstances leading to the towing (did the cars pose a hazard or a significant obstruction to traffic) and on the post-towing procedures available to Frier. So one might wonder whether more was at work than efficiency. And, in fact, the cases suggest that besides efficiency, preclusion aims at preventing inconsistent judgments. Consider a very simple case, in which Creditor sues Debtor on an unpaid promissory note and prevails. Could Debtor now turn around and sue Creditor for fraud, claiming that the very note on which Creditor had just won a judgment was the product of fraud? No; in the words of an often-cited case:</p>

Thus, for example, a judgment rendered on a promissory note is conclusive as to the validity of the instrument and the amount due upon it, although it be subsequently alleged that perfect defenses actually existed, of which no proof was offered, such as forgery, want of consideration, or payment. If such defenses were not presented in the action, and established by competent evidence, <i>the subsequent allegation of their existence is of no consequence.</i></p>

	<p id="c0f4a8c9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most commonly, claim preclusion will operate only between those who were the parties to both the first and second lawsuits; by contrast, different parties possess different claims for preclusion purposes, even when those claims arise out of the same transaction. To use <i>Frier</i> again as an example, suppose Charles Frier had a roommate, who also parked cars in the alley, and they were similarly towed. The decision in <i>Frier</i> would not bar roommate’s claim (though Frier’s case might provide a precedential barrier to roommate’s claim).</p>
	<p id="c0f4a8ca-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The proposition that claim preclusion operates only between the same parties has, however, several exceptions. Imagine, for example, that the owner of Suburbanacre sues Neighbor for trespass, and the court rules that Neighbor enjoys a permanent easement over Owner’s land. If Owner sells Suburbanacre to Buyer, Buyer will be bound by the judgment, even though he was not a party to the action. In buying the land, he “buys” the result of litigation defining the nature of Owner’s rights. Courts describe Buyer as being bound because he is “in privity” with Owner, a phrase that makes sense given the transaction between Owner and Buyer. Courts have sometimes gone even further than this, finding that someone not formally named as a party is so closely connected to a suit that it is appropriate to treat her as if she were named. When they do so, they use the same phrase, “in privity,” to describe the party bound by the first suit. That term is harmless as long as one understands that it merely expresses the conclusion that the person whose name was not on the caption of the first case should nevertheless be bound. When that should happen is the issue before the court in the next case.</p>

Rather, they ask us to abandon the attempt to delineate discrete grounds and clear rules altogether. Preclusion is in order, they contend, whenever “the relationship between a party and a non-party is ‘close enough’ to bring the second litigant within the judgment.” Courts should make the “close enough” determination, they urge, through a “heavily fact-driven” and “equitable” inquiry. . . . </p>

A party’s representation of a nonparty is “adequate” for preclusion purposes only if, at a minimum: (1) the interests of the nonparty and her representative are aligned, see <i>Hansberry</i>; and (2) either the party understood herself to be acting in a representative capacity or the original court took care to protect the interests of the nonparty, see <i>Richards.</i> In addition, adequate representation sometimes requires (3) notice of the original suit to the persons alleged to have been represented.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10584_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10584_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">6</a></span> In the class-action context, these limitations are implemented by the procedural safeguards contained in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.</p>

These protections, grounded in due process, could be circumvented were we to approve a virtual representation doctrine that allowed courts to “create de facto class actions at will.”</p>

Most obviously, it could significantly complicate the task of district courts faced in the first instance with preclusion questions.

	<p id="c0f51e27-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally. . . . the FAA maintains that nonparty preclusion should apply more broadly in “public-law” litigation than in “private-law” controversies. To support this position, the FAA offers two arguments. First, the FAA urges, our decision in <i>Richards</i> acknowledges that, in certain cases, the plaintiff has a reduced interest in controlling the litigation “because of the public nature of the right at issue.”  . . . </p>
	<p id="c0f51e28-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[W]e said in <i>Richards</i> only that, for the type of public-law claims there envisioned, [state and federal legislatures] are free to adopt procedures limiting repetitive litigation [involving public rights]. . . . It hardly follows, however, that this Court should proscribe or confine successive FOIA suits by different requesters. Indeed, Congress’ provision for FOIA suits with no statutory constraint on successive actions counsels against judicial imposition of constraints through extraordinary application of the common law of preclusion.</p>
	<p id="c0f51e29-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The FAA next argues that “the threat of vexatious litigation is heightened” in public-law cases because “the number of plaintiffs with standing is potentially limitless.”  . . . </p>
	<p id="c0f51e2a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But we are not convinced that this risk justifies departure from the usual rules governing nonparty preclusion. First, <i>stare decisis</i> will allow courts swiftly to dispose of repetitive suits brought in the same circuit. Second, even when <i>stare decisis</i> is not dispositive, “the human tendency not to waste money will deter the bringing of suits based on claims or issues that have already been adversely determined against others.” This intuition seems to be borne out by experience: The FAA has not called our attention to any instances of abusive FOIA suits in the Circuits that reject the virtual-representation theory respondents advocate here.</p>

Several lawsuits challenging the legality of the tax were filed. The first of these, Bedingfield v. Jefferson County, 520 So. 2d 1270 (Ala. 1988), went to the Alabama Supreme Court, which upheld the tax. When Richards filed a separate action, raising federal law challenges to the tax, the Alabama Supreme Court held “that the federal claims as well as the state claims were barred by the adjudication in <i>Bedingfield</i>. . . . [because a] judgment is generally ‘<i>res judicata</i> not only as to all matters litigated and decided by it, but as to all relevant issues which could have been but were not raised and litigated in the suit,’” (quoting Jefferson County v.

	<p id="c0f56c63-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">State courts are generally free to develop their own rules for protecting against the relitigation of common issues or the piecemeal resolution of disputes. We have long held, however, that extreme applications of the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> may be inconsistent with a federal right that is “fundamental in character.”  . . . </p>
	<p id="c0f56c64-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The limits on a state court’s power to develop estoppel rules reflect the general consensus “’in Anglo-American jurisprudence that one is not bound by a judgment in personam in a litigation in which he is not designated as a party or to which he has not been made a party by service of process.’ <i>Hansberry v. Lee</i> [infra page 831]. . . . This rule is part of our ‘deep-rooted historic tradition that everyone should have his own day in court.’” <i>Martin v. Wilks</i> [infra page 819] . . . . </p>
	<p id="c0f56c65-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, these principles do not always require one to have been a party to a judgment in order to be bound by it. Most notably, there is an exception when it can be said that there is “privity” between a party to the second case and a party who is bound by an earlier judgment. For example, a judgment that is binding on a guardian or trustee may also bind the ward or the beneficiaries of a trust. Moreover. . . . the term “privity” is now used to describe various relationships between litigants that would not have come within the traditional definition of that term. See generally Restatement (Second) of Judgments, ch. 4 (1980). . . . [The Court said the procedure followed in this case did not satisfy the conditions for “privity."]</p>
	<p id="c0f56c66-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We begin by noting that the parties to the <i>Bedingfield</i> case failed to provide petitioners with any notice that a suit was pending which would conclusively resolve their legal rights. That failure is troubling because, as we explained in <i>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co.</i> [supra page 165], the right to be heard ensured by the guarantee of due process “has little reality or worth unless one is informed that the matter is pending and can choose for himself whether to appear or default, acquiesce or contest.”  . . . </p>

	<p id="c0f56c69-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . [T]here is no reason to suppose that the <i>Bedingfield</i> court took care to protect the interests of petitioners in the manner suggested in <i>Hansberry</i>. Nor is there any reason to suppose that the individual taxpayers in <i>Bedingfield</i> understood their suit to be on behalf of absent county taxpayers. Thus, to contend that the plaintiffs in <i>Bedingfield</i> somehow represented petitioners, let alone represented them in a constitutionally adequate manner, would be “to attribute to them a power that it cannot be said that they had assumed to exercise.” <i>Hansberry</i>. . . . </p>
	<p id="c0f56c6a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, we are aware that governmental and private entities have substantial interests in the prompt and determinative resolution of challenges to important legislation. We do not agree with the Alabama Supreme Court, however, that, given the amount of money at stake, respondents were entitled to rely on the assumption that the <i>Bedingfield</i> action “authoritatively established” the constitutionality of the tax. A state court’s freedom to rely on prior precedent in rejecting a litigant’s claims does not afford it similar freedom to bind a litigant to a prior judgment to which he was not a party. That general rule clearly applies when a taxpayer seeks a hearing to prevent the State from subjecting him to a levy in violation of the Federal Constitution.</p>

	<p id="c0f5ba9d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not all final judgments, even though they involve the same claim and the same parties, receive preclusive effect. All agree that a judgment after a full trial is undoubtedly entitled to preclusive effect. Short of that, however, when ought preclusive effect to attach? The problem is difficult because courts might want to assign preclusive effect to a judgment for two quite different reasons. One reason, of course, is that the court considered and decided the merits of the lawsuit. A different reason would be that the party had misbehaved (for example, refused to obey court orders) and the court dismissed the suit as a sanction. Such a dismissal would have nothing to do with the merits of the complaint, but the sanction would be futile unless it barred the refiling of the suit. Unfortunately, courts sometimes discuss this problem by stating that preclusive effect ought to attach only to judgments “on the merits.” Like “in privity,” this phrase conceals more than it explains, because it begs the real question: For what reasons and under what circumstances should we attach preclusive effect to a judgment? In studying this question, try to put the deceptive “on the merits” phrase out of your mind.</p>

This problem—how to treat a judgment following a dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Rule 12(b)(6)—presents an issue that calls one’s entire understanding of procedure into question. On the one hand, such a dismissal can be for essentially formal reasons: The plaintiff’s lawyer forgot that one must allege an agreement as part of a breach of contract suit. If the underlying facts suggest an agreement, it seems unjust to preclude when a sentence added to the pleading would have cured the problem. On the other hand, if the plaintiff’s lawyer has alleged all that can truthfully be alleged and the complaint is still dismissed, isn’t that a statement about the merits of a claim?</p>

	<li class=""><p id="c0f5e1bd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One might think that one reason to treat Rule 12(b)(6) dismissals as preclusive flows from the ease of amending pleadings. It is axiomatic that a trial court should not dismiss a pleading for failure to state a claim without granting plaintiff at least one opportunity to amend; a trial court’s dismissal without leave to amend would be strong grounds for reversal. Suppose plaintiff does amend, and the trial court nevertheless dismisses the amended complaint. Is the opportunity to amend—after being instructed by the trial court what was wrong with the original complaint—a sufficient assurance that plaintiff has stated any possible claim, and therefore justification for assigning preclusive effect? In Federated Department Stores v. Moitie, 452 U.S. 394 (1981), the Supreme Court apparently accepted such reasoning, in a footnote that, in its entirety, reads: “The dismissal for failure to state a claim under Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6) is a ‘judgment on the merits.’” Id. at 399 n.3. The statement was necessary to the decision of the case and is thus a holding, but the Court did not explain its justification for this conclusion.</p></li>

App. 3d 812, 391 N.E.2d 35 (1979) (under Illinois procedural law, dismissal for failure to plead enough facts to state a claim does not bar a second suit with the necessary facts added; presumably it would bar bringing a suit based on an identically worded complaint); Keidatz v. Albany, 39 Cal. 2d 826, 249 P.2d 264 (1952) (dismissal on demurrer bars subsequent action on complaint alleging same facts but does not bar claim raising new issues or new facts in support of same claim).

Sometimes the analysis of that question will be easy. For example, suppose the United States sues Student civilly, seeking nonpayment of two student loans, both signed on the same day and containing an identical, allegedly fraudulent statement regarding Student’s assets. Student defends on the grounds that the statements in the loan documents are true. If Student loses the first lawsuit, the fraudulence of the statement in question will be precluded in a second suit as well.</p>

Suppose that the government prevails in the student loan lawsuits, establishing fraudulent misstatements. The United States then prosecutes Student criminally, basing its charge on the proposition that Student obtained the loans fraudulently. Student defends on grounds that the statements are true. Does the government’s previous victory in the civil lawsuit preclude Student from his defense? No: Civil and criminal proceedings operate under different burdens of proof. To prevail, as the government did, on a civil burden of preponderance of the evidence<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10965_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10965_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*3</a></span> does not mean that one can establish the same issue beyond a reasonable doubt.

For example, in <i>Gargallo v.

	<p id="c0f740b8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider another explanation: Professor Martin Shapiro has argued that “it must always be remembered that the basic aim of a trial is to resolve a conflict or to impose social controls, not to find the facts. Much of what may appear to be unsatisfactory as pure fact-finding, if we were applying general scientific canons for empirical inquiry, may be quite satisfactory in the specific context of trials.” Shapiro, Courts: A Comparative and Political Analysis 44 (1981). If Professor Shapiro’s analysis is correct, courts are understandably hesitant to transplant the “findings” to a second dispute because it is a different dispute.

Parks</i>, the court declined to apply preclusion because the opacity of the general verdict made it difficult to determine what the first judgment had decided. Sometimes courts face the opposite problem: too many findings in support of a judgment. In a trial to the bench, Rule 52(a) requires the judge to set forth findings of fact and conclusions of law. Imagine that the trial in <i>Parks</i> had taken place before a judge, who had determined (1) that Illinois Central had not been negligent and (2) that Jessie Parks had been contributorily negligent. Under these circumstances, should the court in a subsequent claim between the same parties hold Jessie precluded from relitigating both those issues? Or neither one? That question, though it occurs infrequently, reveals the values underlying the doctrine. The first Restatement of Judgments took the position that when alternative grounds for decision existed, <i>both</i> should be precluded in subsequent litigation. The Restatement (Second) of Judgments §27 comment i says that <i>neither</i> determination should be binding in subsequent litigation.

	<p id="c0f767e2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What idea lies behind the importance that the Restatement (Second) attaches not just to the opportunity to appeal but to actual appellate litigation of alternative grounds? Put yourself in the position of the plaintiff in the hypothetical lawsuit. You have just lost big in federal district court, with the judge throwing your lawsuit out of court on two alternative grounds. One of those grounds was that the defendant had insufficient contacts with the state to permit personal jurisdiction. You think that finding rests on very flimsy grounds, so you say to your lawyer, “We should appeal.”</p>
	<p id="c0f767e3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Your lawyer will explain why an appeal claiming that the personal jurisdiction ruling was erroneous isn’t worth his time or your money. Even if you’re right about the personal jurisdiction ruling, the court of appeals will affirm the judgment—because the other ground for dismissal stands. Recall that appellate courts in the United States do not review the correctness of each trial court ruling—just whether the resulting judgment was justified—and here it was.</p>
	<p id="c0f767e4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider that the Restatement (Second) position is based on an image of litigation not <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="744" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page744">p. 744</span>as a search for truth but as a set of incentives and disincentives. In that world, a judge will have less reason to be careful about any particular finding if there are other independent grounds leading to the same result. The losing litigant will have less incentive to appeal any particular finding if it seems likely that the appellate court will affirm on the basis of the other, independent grounds for decision. Under those circumstances, the theory goes, too few people have an incentive to make sure the findings are accurate. That being the case, we should be reluctant to import those findings into a second lawsuit.</p>

	<p id="c0f767e7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have thus far dealt with situations in which the former and the present lawsuits involve the same parties. Common law required this identity of parties (called “mutuality") for both claim preclusion and issue preclusion. It continues to be a requirement for claim preclusion; in recent decades, however, many courts have abandoned this requirement for issue preclusion.</p>
	<p id="c0f767e8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To see how such a scheme might operate, consider a variation on the facts in <i>Illinois Central Gulf Railroad v. Parks</i>. Wife alone sues Railroad for injuries suffered in a crossing collision. Wife wins a judgment. Husband now sues for his injuries sustained in the same accident. Railroad cannot argue that his claim is precluded by the first lawsuit: Biologically separate individuals possess separate claims, and no rule compels such individuals, even when married to each other, to prosecute their claims together. So Husband’s suit can go forward.</p>
	<p id="c0f767e9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Husband v. Railroad</i>, can either party take advantage of issue preclusion? Seventy-five years ago, the answer was a clear no. Like claim preclusion, issue preclusion applied only if the parties in the second suit both had been parties in the first suit, and, because Husband was not a party to that first lawsuit, the conditions for issue preclusion were not met: “Mutuality”—conditions under which both parties could benefit from or be burdened with preclusion—did not exist. The last several decades have seen that principle of mutuality erode. Many courts today would permit Husband, even though he had not been a party to the first suit, to take advantage of an issue fully litigated and determined in that suit. In such a case Railroad’s negligence, causation, and proximate causation would all be candidates for preclusion in the second action. The rationale for that extension of issue preclusion is that the victim of issue preclusion (here, Railroad) had a full and fair opportunity to litigate those issues in the first suit.</p>
	<p id="c0f767ea-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now change one factor: What if Railroad had won the first suit, demonstrating to the jury’s satisfaction that it was not negligent? Could it take advantage of that determination in a second action brought by Husband? The answer is no. Whether they attribute this result to simple fairness or to due process, all agree that a party who has never had an opportunity to litigate an issue cannot be precluded from doing so. (<i>Taylor v. Sturgell,</i> supra page 720, illustrates these principles in the claim preclusion context.) The abandonment of mutuality thus creates a potential asymmetry: If Railroad loses the first case brought by Wife, it will be saddled by that loss in subsequent litigation with Husband. If it wins against Wife, however, <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="745" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page745">p. 745</span>it must still defend against Husband. The anomaly has its logic; as one pioneering decision put it:</p>

	<p id="c0f78efb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The criteria for determining who may assert a plea of [issue preclusion] differ fundamentally from the criteria for determining against whom [such] a plea. . . . may be asserted. The requirements of due process of law forbid the assertion of a plea of. . . . [issue preclusion] against a party unless he was bound by the earlier litigation in which the matter was decided. He is bound by that litigation only if he has been a party thereto or in privity with a party thereto.

The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed, holding that a party who has had issues of fact determined against him after a full and fair opportunity to litigate in a nonjury trial is collaterally estopped from obtaining a subsequent jury trial of these same issues of fact. The appellate court concluded that “the Seventh Amendment preserves the right to jury trial only with respect to issues of fact, [and] once those issues have been fully and fairly adjudicated in a prior proceeding, nothing remains for trial, either with or without a jury.” Because of an inter-Circuit conflict, we granted certiorari.</p>

	<p id="c0f7b624-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Blonder-Tongue</i> case involved defensive use of collateral estoppel—a plaintiff was estopped from asserting a claim that the plaintiff had previously litigated and lost against another defendant. The present case, by contrast, involves offensive use of collateral estoppel—a plaintiff is seeking to estop a defendant from relitigating the issues which the defendant previously litigated and lost against another plaintiff. In both the offensive and defensive use situations, the party against whom estoppel is asserted has litigated and lost in an earlier action. Nevertheless, several reasons have been advanced why the two situations should be treated differently.</p>
	<p id="c0f7b625-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, offensive use of collateral estoppel does not promote judicial economy in the same manner as defensive use does. Defensive use of collateral estoppel precludes a plaintiff from relitigating identical issues by merely “switching adversaries.” <i>Bernhard v. Bank of America Natl.

Offensive use of collateral estoppel, on the other hand, creates precisely the opposite incentive. Since a plaintiff will be able to rely on a previous judgment against a defendant but will not be bound by that judgment if the defendant wins, the plaintiff has every incentive to adopt a “wait and see” attitude, in the hope that the first action by another plaintiff will result in a favorable judgment. <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="748" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page748">p. 748</span>Thus offensive use of collateral estoppel will likely increase rather than decrease the total amount of litigation, since potential plaintiffs will have everything to gain and nothing to lose by not intervening in the first action.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C02_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10C02_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">13</a></span> A second argument against offensive use of collateral estoppel is that it may be unfair to a defendant. If a defendant in the first action is sued for small or nominal damages, he may have little incentive to defend vigorously, particularly if future suits are not foreseeable. The <i>Evergreens v. Nunan</i>; cf. <i>Berner v. British Commonwealth Pac. Airlines</i> (application of offensive collateral estoppel denied where defendant did not appeal an adverse judgment awarding damages of $35,000 and defendant was later sued for over $7 million). Allowing offensive collateral estoppel may also be unfair to a defendant if the judgment relied upon as a basis for the estoppel is itself inconsistent with one or more previous judgments in favor of the defendant.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C0E_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10C0E_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">14</a></span> Still another situation where it might be unfair to apply offensive estoppel is where the second action affords the defendant procedural opportunities unavailable in the first action that could readily cause a different result.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C17_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10C17_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">15</a></span></p>

	<p id="c0f7dd3b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have concluded that the preferable approach for dealing with these problems in the federal courts is not to preclude the use of offensive collateral estoppel, but to grant trial courts broad discretion to determine when it should be applied.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C27_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10C27_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">16</a></span> The general rule should be that in cases where a plaintiff could easily have joined in the earlier action or where, either for the reasons discussed above or for other reasons, the application of offensive estoppel would be unfair to a defendant, a trial judge should not allow the use of offensive collateral estoppel.</p>
	<p id="c0f7dd3d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the present case, however, none of the circumstances that might justify reluctance to allow the offensive use of collateral estoppel is present. The application of <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="749" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page749">p. 749</span>offensive collateral estoppel will not here reward a private plaintiff who could have joined in the previous action, since the respondent probably could not have joined in the injunctive action brought by the SEC even had he so desired.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C33_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10C33_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">17</a></span> Similarly, there is no unfairness to the petitioners in applying offensive collateral estoppel in this case. First, in light of the serious allegations made in the SEC’s complaint against the petitioners, as well as the foreseeability of subsequent private suits that typically follow a successful Government judgment, the petitioners had every incentive to litigate the SEC lawsuit fully and vigorously.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C3B_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10C3B_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">18</a></span> Second, the judgment in the SEC action was not inconsistent with any previous decision. Finally, there will in the respondent’s action be no procedural opportunities available to the petitioners that were unavailable in the first action of a kind that might be likely to cause a different result.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C41_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10C41_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">19</a></span> We conclude, therefore, that none of the considerations that would justify a refusal to allow the use of offensive collateral estoppel is present in this case. Since the petitioners received a “full and fair” opportunity to litigate their claims in the SEC action, the contemporary law of collateral estoppel leads inescapably to the conclusion that the petitioners are collaterally estopped from relitigating the question of whether the proxy statement was materially false and misleading.</p>

	<p id="c0f8528c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is a glaring exception to the Court’s endorsement of nonmutual preclusion: the federal government. In United States v. Mendoza, 464 U.S. 154 (1984), the Court held that the United States could not be subjected to nonmutual issue preclusion. The ordinary rules of issue preclusion apply if Party and the United States are involved in two successive lawsuits, but if <i>A</i> sues the United States and prevails, <i>B</i> may not in a later suit use against the United States those issues determined in <i>A</i>’s favor. Otherwise put, the principles of <i>Parklane</i> do not apply to the United States. Why not? The <i>Mendoza</i> Court did not do a very good job of justifying its result, but one can imagine two reasons.</p>
	<p id="c0f8528d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is a practical problem. At present the United States appeals selectively, choosing only those cases in which some principle of law or fact important to the United States is at stake. (The office of the Solicitor General makes these discretionary judgments.) The <i>Mendoza</i> Court worried that applying <i>Parklane</i> to the United States would force the government to appeal virtually every case it lost, for fear of its effect in subsequent cases. Note that this same problem afflicts other large litigants—state governments, Microsoft, General Motors, large insurers—but no such exception has been carved out for them.</p>
	<p id="c0f8528e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The United States faces another problem. Some of the suits to which it is a party involve constitutional questions. As things now stand, an unappealed decision of a district court involving a constitutional question affects only the parties involved in the case itself. It does not even bind other courts in the same district. If one applied <i>Parklane</i> to the United States, all that would change. A single district court decision against the United States on a constitutional issue would become—by virtue of issue preclusion—super-precedent that would bind all other courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court. For example, suppose a district court in the course of a criminal trial ruled that all searches of automobiles without a warrant were unconstitutional. If that ruling stood, it could be applied against the United States by all subsequent defendants. Moreover, unlike ordinary precedent, the ruling would not be subject to reconsideration or “overruling” by the U.S. Supreme Court. Is this a good enough reason not to extend <i>Parklane</i> to the United States? Or does it suggest a narrower exception involving only questions of constitutional law?</p>

Fifty of those businesses sued Century Home Components (one of the strip-mall tenants), alleging that its negligent treatment of a dumpster full of sawdust and oil had caused the fire to break out. The first two cases tried resulted in defense verdicts. On appeal the first judgment was reversed on account of defendant’s failure to produce a document in discovery. The third case tried resulted in a plaintiff’s verdict, as did the first case on retrial. At that point the remaining litigants moved to preclude defendant on the issues of negligence and causation, leaving only damages to be tried. Plaintiffs reasoned that there were two plaintiff’s verdicts, the issues were identical, and because Oregon had adopted nonmutual preclusion, they were entitled to take advantage of preclusion. The Oregon Supreme Court thought otherwise:</p>

	<p id="c0f85293-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The “multiple-claimant anomaly” was first hypothesized by Brainerd Currie as one instance where, absent mutuality, the unrestrained application of collateral estoppel might produce unfair results. Currie, Mutuality of Collateral Estoppel: Limits of the Bernhard Doctrine, 9 Stan. L. Rev. 281 (1957). Currie posed the situation of a train wreck resulting in 50 separate claims being filed against the railroad for negligence. If the defendant railroad won the first 25 cases and subsequently lost the 26th, Currie characterized as an “absurdity” the notion that the remaining 24 claimants could ride in on the strength of the 26th plaintiff’s judgment and estop the defendant on the issue of negligence. The reason was that the 26th judgment would clearly seem to be an aberration. Currie then reasoned that, if we should be unwilling to give preclusive effect to the 26th judgment, we should not afford such effect to an adverse judgment rendered in the <i>first</i> action brought because “we have no warrant for assuming that the aberrational judgment will not come as the first in the series.” Currie, supra. Currie thus concluded that, absent mutuality, collateral estoppel should not be applied where a defendant potentially faces more than two successive actions.</p>
	<p id="c0f879a4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those courts which have discarded the rule of mutuality and permit the offensive assertion of collateral estoppel have generally rejected Currie’s solution to the multiple-claimant anomaly in situations where the <i>first</i> judgment is adverse to the defendant, and have precluded a defendant from relitigating multiple claims where it has been concluded that the defendant had in actuality the incentive and complete opportunity to contest the issue fully in the first action. Currie’s reservations were based on the apprehension that the first judgment might well be an aberration, but this view failed to recognize that the very notion of collateral estoppel demands and assumes a certain confidence in the integrity of the end result of our adjudicative process. . . . </p>
	<p id="c0f879a5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the foregoing discussion would indicate, however, we are not free to disregard incongruous results when they are looking us in the eye. If the circumstances are such that our confidence in the integrity of the determination is severely undermined, or that the result would likely be different in a second trial, it would work an injustice to deny the litigant another chance. Thus, <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="754" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page754">p. 754</span>where it is apparent that the verdict was the result of a jury compromise, the losing party should not be precluded by the judgment. . . . It has also been held that if the prior determination was manifestly erroneous the judgment should not be given preclusive effect. Restatement (Second) of Judgments §88(7) and Comment i. (Tent. Draft No. 2, 1975). And the existence of newly discovered or crucial evidence that was not available to the litigant at the first trial would provide a basis for denying preclusion where it appears the evidence would have a significant effect on the outcome.</p>

	<p id="c0f9161b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This chapter has focused on a pair of common law doctrines that prevent subsequent lawsuits from undermining judgments. Claim preclusion, by preventing subsequent litigation of the same claim, requires the parties to include related grievances in the same suit. Issue preclusion prevents inconsistent findings when subsequent litigation is permitted. We turn now to two principles that ensure that courts heed the doctrines of former adjudication without producing unfair hardship.</p>
	<p id="c0f9161c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To see their relationship, consider a hypothetical case. Motorists from New York and New Jersey collide with each other. New Jersey plaintiff sues New York defendant in New Jersey state court and loses. Could plaintiff try again by going to New York and suing there in either state or federal court? Or suppose that after the <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="758" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page758">p. 758</span>original case has gone to judgment, plaintiff discovers a witness who supplies the crucial missing evidence of defendant’s negligence; moreover, plaintiff discovers that defendant knew of the witness but failed to reveal his existence in response to interrogatories. Can plaintiff somehow bring this evidence before the court? The doctrines of claim preclusion do not answer the first question because, as common law doctrines under state law, they speak only to the courts of a given jurisdiction: On the facts given, they tell the New Jersey courts that N.J. Motorist cannot bring a second suit in that state; but they say nothing to the courts of New York. As the next section shows, principles of full faith and credit back up the common law by insisting that courts of one jurisdiction heed the judgments of another, here telling N.Y. courts to heed the N.J. judgment. But the doctrines of former adjudication, reinforced by full faith and credit, have the potential to work injustice if, for example, they perpetuate defendant’s fraudulent concealment of evidence in the second hypothetical. To prevent that, legislatures have created the opportunity, in very limited circumstances, to reopen a judgment.</p>

	<p id="c0f9161f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The common law doctrines of claim and issue preclusion require courts of any given political unit to heed the judgments of courts of that unit. They give, however, no guidance respecting the judgments of sister jurisdictions—other states or the federal government. Two provisions of law fill that silence. The Constitution, in Article IV, obligates state courts to recognize sister-state judgments—to give them, in the Constitution’s words “Full Faith and Credit.” Section 1738 of 28 U.S.C. demands that all courts, state and federal, give the same full faith and credit to state court judgments as those states would themselves give. This rule makes sense: Parties litigating in the courts of one state should know in advance what the preclusive effects of any ruling will be.</p>

	<p id="c0f91620-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Though §1738 does not mention full faith and credit to federal court judgments, that requirement has always been assumed and is not questioned, either as a proposition of federal common law or, as some would have it, an implication of the Supremacy Clause, found in Article VI ("This Constitution and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof. . . . shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereb. . . . ").</p>

	<p id="c0f91621-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If one puts these provisions together with the common law of preclusion, they create an apparently seamless web. Within any given political unit, the applicable common law doctrine of preclusion prevents attacks on the judgment. Although, as we have seen, the doctrine of preclusion may differ in certain ways from state to state (for example, some states recognize the “same transaction or occurrence” test for the scope of claim preclusion, while others may recognize a “same evidence” test), the generally applied doctrine is clear: Any claim that was or could have been litigated in the previous case may not be relitigated, and any issue that was litigated may not be relitigated in a second proceeding by a disappointed litigant. Put in legal terms, “collateral attack” on the outcome of Case 1 is not available in Case 2. Across the boundaries of political units—what is called “interjurisdictional preclusion”—the principles of full faith and credit require that the courts of one unit <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="759" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page759">p. 759</span>give to sister courts’ judgments the same effect they would have in the unit that rendered them. We have already seen these principles in operation in <i>Gargallo v. Merrill Lynch et al.</i>, supra page 732, and <i>Frier v. City of Vandalia</i>, supra page 705.</p>
	<p id="c0f91622-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is, however, a hole—of indeterminate size—in this doctrinal tapestry: Under some circumstances one may collaterally attack a judgment—that is, contest the enforceability in Case 2 of a judgment reached in Case 1—on the ground that the court rendering the judgment lacked jurisdiction to decide it. (That is one of the holdings of <i>Pennoyer v. Neff</i>, supra page 68.) In principle, this makes sense: A party should not be bound by a judgment reached by a court that lacked power to render it. Nineteenth-century courts often asserted this proposition in sweeping terms, saying that a judgment entered without jurisdiction was “void.” One implication of that proposition was that such a judgment was not entitled to full faith and credit—and that giving it full faith and credit might itself violate the Constitution. Again, <i>Pennoyer v. Neff</i>, where personal jurisdiction over the defendant was lacking in the first case, is a classic example of this proposition.</p>
	<p id="c0f91623-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Put in the most general terms, the objection that a judgment was invalid for want of jurisdiction created a significant exception to the doctrines of finality. More recent decisions have clarified and limited this “jurisdictional” exception, helping to maintain the power of the doctrine of preclusion to produce genuine finality in litigation. For example, <i>Pennoyer v. Neff</i> makes clear that lack of personal jurisdiction in Case 1 can be a legitimate basis for collaterally attacking the judgment reached in that case in Case 2. Can the same be said when the problem in Case 1 is the absence of <i>subject matter</i> jurisdiction? The next case (involving the subject matter jurisdiction of a state rather than a federal court) considers that question.</p>

V.L. then filed an adoption petition in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia. E.L. also appeared in that proceeding. While not relinquishing her own parental rights, she gave her express consent to V.L.’s adoption of the children as a second parent. The Georgia court determined that V.L. had complied with the applicable requirements of Georgia law, and entered a final decree of adoption allowing V.L. to adopt the children and recognizing both V.L. and E.L. as their legal parents.</p>

	<p id="c0f93c40-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Constitution provides that “Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State.” That Clause requires each State to recognize and give effect to valid judgments rendered by the courts of its sister States. It serves “to alter the status of the several states as independent foreign sovereignties, each free to ignore obligations created under the laws or by the judicial proceedings of the others, and to make them integral parts of a single nation.”</p>
	<p id="c0f93c41-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With respect to judgments, “the full faith and credit obligation is exacting.” “A final judgment in one State, if rendered by a court with adjudicatory authority over the subject matter and persons governed by the judgment, qualifies for recognition throughout the land.” A State may not disregard the judgment of a sister State because it disagrees with the reasoning underlying the judgment or deems it to be wrong on the merits. On the contrary, “the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution precludes any inquiry into the merits of the cause of action, the logic or consistency of the decision, or the validity of the legal principles on which the judgment is based.”</p>
	<p id="c0f93c42-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A State is not required, however, to afford full faith and credit to a judgment rendered by a court that “did not have jurisdiction over the subject matter or the relevant parties.” “Consequently, before a court is bound by [a] judgment rendered in another State, it may inquire into the jurisdictional basis of the foreign court’s decree.” That jurisdictional inquiry, however, is a limited one. “[I]f the judgment on its face appears to be a ‘record of a court of general jurisdiction, such jurisdiction over the cause and the parties is to be presumed unless disproved by extrinsic evidence, or by the record itself.’”</p>
	<p id="c0f93c43-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="761" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page761">p. 761</span>Those principles resolve this case. Under Georgia law, as relevant here, “[t]he superior courts of the several counties shall have exclusive jurisdiction in all matters of adoption.” Ga. Code Ann. §19-8-2(a) (2015). That provision on its face gave the Georgia Superior Court subject-matter jurisdiction to hear and decide the adoption petition at issue here. The Superior Court resolved that matter by entering a final judgment that made V.L. the legal adoptive parent of the children. Whatever the merits of that judgment, it was within the statutory grant of jurisdiction over “all matters of adoption.” The Georgia court thus had the “adjudicatory authority over the subject matter” required to entitle its judgment to full faith and credit.</p>
	<p id="c0f93c44-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Alabama Supreme Court reached a different result by relying on Ga. Code Ann. §19-8-5(a). That statute states (as relevant here) that “a child who has any living parent or guardian may be adopted by a third party. . . . only if each such living parent and each such guardian has voluntarily and in writing surrendered all of his or her rights to such child.” The Alabama Supreme Court concluded that this provision prohibited the Georgia Superior Court from allowing V.L. to adopt the children while also allowing E.L. to keep her existing parental rights. It further concluded that this provision went not to the merits but to the Georgia court’s subject-matter jurisdiction. . . . </p>
	<p id="c0f93c45-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That analysis is not consistent with this Court’s controlling precedent. Where a judgment indicates on its face that it was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, such jurisdiction “is to be presumed unless disproved.” There is nothing here to rebut that presumption. The Georgia statute, on which the Alabama Supreme Court relied, does not speak in jurisdictional terms; for instance, it does not say that a Georgia court “shall have jurisdiction to enter an adoption decree” only if each existing parent or guardian has surrendered his or her parental rights. . . . </p>
	<p id="c0f93c46-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 19-8-5(a) does not become jurisdictional just because it is “mandatory” and “must be strictly construed.” This Court “has long rejected the notion that all mandatory prescriptions, however emphatic, are properly typed jurisdictional.” Indeed, the Alabama Supreme Court’s reasoning would give jurisdictional status to <i>every</i> requirement of the Georgia adoption statutes, since Georgia law indicates those requirements are all mandatory and must be strictly construed. That result would comport neither with Georgia law nor with common sense.</p>
	<p id="c0f93c47-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As Justice Holmes observed more than a century ago, “it sometimes may be difficult to decide whether certain words in a statute are directed to jurisdiction or to merits.” In such cases, especially where the Full Faith and Credit Clause is concerned, a court must be “slow to read ambiguous words, as meaning to leave the judgment open to dispute, or as intended to do more than fix the rule by which the court should decide.” That time-honored rule controls here. The Georgia judgment appears on its face to have been issued by a court with jurisdiction, and there is no established Georgia law to the contrary. It follows that the Alabama Supreme Court erred in refusing to grant that judgment full faith and credit.</p>
	<p id="c0f93c48-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The petition for writ of certiorari is granted. The judgment of the Alabama Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. <i>It is so ordered.</i></p>

Ironically, the choice of appealing in timely fashion the Georgia adoption decree through the Georgia appellate system was not realistically available to E.L., because at that time she was actually in support of the adoption decree. In reality, once that decree was entered by the Georgia court, E.L. never had a legally recognized opportunity to attack or contest it.</p></li>
	<li class=""><p id="c0f96362-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Does the U.S. Supreme Court adequately recognize that there was no genuine adversarial quality to the adoption proceeding, and whether that should militate in favor of permitting collateral attack once the relationship dissolved and E.L. took a different position on the validity of the adoption?</p></li>

	<li class=""><p id="c0f96363-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The analysis and result in <i>V.L. v. E.L.</i> demonstrates that the requirement of full faith and credit to sister-state judgments is, as Justice Ginsburg has put <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="763" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page763">p. 763</span>it, “exacting.” Baker v. General Motors Corp., 522 U.S. 222, 233 (1998). Apart from collateral attacks on jurisdiction and the reopening of judgments as discussed below, full faith and credit is due to sister-state judgments, period. In particular, the fact that the court in the first case may have made an obvious error—basing its decision on an incorrect reading of the facts, or misapplying the law governing the case—is not a basis for the courts of another state to deny full faith and credit to the judgment. This has been the rule at least since Justice Holmes’s opinion for the Court in Fauntleroy v. Lum, 210 U.S. 230 (1908), which is quoted briefly in <i>V.L. v. E.L.</i></p></li>
	<li class=""><p id="c0f96364-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Pennoyer v. Neff</i> establishes that a party over whom the court lacks personal jurisdiction, and who does not appear in the case, may collaterally challenge the resulting judgment. That proposition is still good law. After all, in the case of such a default judgment, the validity of personal jurisdiction was never explicitly found, and no defendant was there to raise the issue. The opposite proposition—that a party who appears and contests personal jurisdiction is bound by the court’s decision on the jurisdictional question—was decided in Baldwin v. Iowa State Traveling Men’s Assn., 283 U.S. 522 (1931). So collateral attack is not available simply because the losing party disagrees with the first court’s decision on personal jurisdiction. If the first court explicitly found that it had jurisdiction over the defendant, that finding may not be relitigated.</p></li>
	<li class=""><p id="c0f96365-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Durfee v. Duke, 375 U.S. 106 (1963), the Supreme Court established the same basic principle when it is subject matter jurisdiction that was allegedly lacking in the first case: Lack of subject matter jurisdiction may, in principle, be a basis for collateral attack, but if the defendant has appeared in the first case and the court has actually found that it had subject matter jurisdiction, no collateral attack is available. It is worth noting that, whereas the U.S. Constitution itself holds that a judgment entered in the absence of constitutionally valid personal jurisdiction is void, the kinds of subject matter jurisdiction issues that arise in state court do not always raise such grandiose constitutional issues; often they simply concern state rules directing various types of litigation to different state courts or determining what kinds of remedies a court can issue. Thus, while state court judgments rendered without proper subject matter jurisdiction are not, as a general matter, entitled to full faith and credit in the courts of other states, that is not necessarily because the initial assertion of subject matter jurisdiction itself violated the Constitution.</p></li>
	<li class=""><p id="c0f96366-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With these principles as background, what made E.L. think she could proceed as she did—mounting a collateral attack on the Georgia court’s ruling on adoption? Suppose that the question a party sought to relitigate was an ordinary factual one: the date of a purported deed conveying land. If a court in State <i>A</i> had decided that question, ordinary preclusion doctrine would bar its relitigation in any subsequent action between the same parties. The Full Faith and Credit Clause (and 28 U.S.C. §1738) would require that the court of a sister state (or a federal court) give the same effect to that decided issue as a court in State <i>A</i>.</p></li>
	<li class=""><p id="c0f96367-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Armed with the knowledge that lack of jurisdiction in Case 1 is an exception to the full faith and credit obligation, E.L. simply tried to argue in the Alabama <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="764" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page764">p. 764</span>courts (initially with some success) that the Georgia courts had lacked jurisdiction to enter the adoption decree. You can see that the U.S. Supreme Court did not buy the argument. The Georgia statute cited by E.L. (and allegedly ignored or wrongly applied by the Georgia court) was not one regulating the jurisdiction of the Georgia trial court; it was one that simply established the prerequisites for granting an adoption under the circumstances faced by V.L. and E.L. Given the prevailing doctrine of full faith and credit, losing parties will have an incentive to characterize laws that were allegedly improperly applied by the first court as <i>jurisdictional</i> in nature, even if such a characterization is dubious.</p>

	<li class=""><p id="c0f96368-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>V.L. v. E.L.</i> takes the doctrine of <i>Durfee v. Duke</i> one small step further, holding that one who appears and fails to challenge subject matter jurisdiction is bound by the resulting judgment, unless she can “rebut that presumption” that the court had jurisdiction. In other words, it is not necessary that the court explicitly rule that it had subject matter jurisdiction in order for its ruling on the merits to be entitled to full faith and credit; if the court proceeds to exercise such jurisdiction under a statute that appears to grant it that power, the validity of the first court’s jurisdiction will be presumed (unless the presumption can be rebutted) in any later collateral attack on the judgment. Thus, E.L. did technically have the opportunity in the Alabama case to collaterally challenge the Georgia courts’ subject matter jurisdiction, but the “rebuttable presumption” approach taken by the Supreme Court unquestionably set a high bar for E.L.</p></li>

In the federal courts, this principle is embodied in Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h). The state judicial systems have various procedures for attaining the same result.</p></li>

General Motors Corp., 522 U.S. 222 (1998), the U.S. Supreme Court held that the courts in State <i>B</i> are not required by the Full Faith and Credit Clause or the federal statute to enforce according to its terms an injunction entered by a court in State <i>A</i>. Ronald Elwell, a former GM engineer who testified against GM in a Georgia state case, reached a settlement with GM in their ensuing legal dispute; that settlement included Elwell’s agreement to a permanent injunction barring Elwell from testifying against GM in other product liability cases. When Elwell nevertheless testified in such a case in a federal court in Missouri, GM sought interstate enforcement of the injunction. The Supreme Court held that full faith and credit did not require enforcement of the injunction by the federal court in Missouri: “Enforcement measures [such as injunctions] do not travel with the sister state judgment as preclusive effects do; such measures remain subject to the even-handed control of forum law.” Of course, the duty of enforcing sister-state money judgments remains firm.</p></li>

Under the full faith and credit statute, 28 U.S.C. §1738, and its requirement to give the “same” full faith and credit as the rendering state, the second state must look to the effect that the first state gives its own judgments from courts lacking subject matter jurisdiction.</p></li>

In the great majority of cases, litigants wishing to challenge the correctness of a judgment must appeal the decision to a higher court rather than file a second lawsuit. This principle, intended to force <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="766" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page766">p. 766</span>challenges into regular channels, can itself work injustice. Consider the case of a litigant who discovers that her opponent has won a victory by unlawful means: Perhaps he failed to serve her with process and thus obtained a default judgment; perhaps he concealed a crucial piece of evidence by failing to produce it in response to an appropriate discovery request. In such a case, appeal will not work because the original court committed no error; the complaint is instead about evidence that never reached the court’s attention. But if the plaintiff simply begins a second lawsuit, she will face the defense of claim preclusion.</p>
	<p id="c0f96375-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The escape from this dilemma lies in the opportunity to reopen a judgment. See Rule 60(b). We approach this subject carefully because any discussion of it tends to overstate its practical availability. The basic mechanisms for correcting errors are post-trial motions in the trial court and appeals. To the extent that another post-judgment remedy is available, it necessarily undercuts the appellate system. For this reason, courts insist repeatedly that relief under Rule 60(b) is not a substitute for appeal.</p>

Consider its effort to define the line between interests in finality of adjudication and the inclination to correct injustices when they occur. Now consider what should happen, under Rule 60, if, after a final judgment, the losing litigant discovers that the opposition has failed during discovery to produce highly relevant, perhaps dispositive, materials in its possession. Compare your intuition to the results of the next case.</p>

If so, it would belong to Beggerly, and the United States would have to purchase it; if not, the U.S. government would already own it. That case settled on the eve of trial for a relatively modest sum, reflecting the uncertainty of Beggerly’s title.] Judgment was entered based on this settlement agreement. In 1994, some 12 years after that judgment, respondents sued in the District Court to set aside the settlement agreement and obtain a damage award for the disputed land. . . . </p>
	<p id="c0f98a8d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During discovery in the <i>Adams</i> litigation, respondents sought proof of their title to the land. Government officials searched public land records and told respondents that they had found nothing proving that any part of Horn Island had ever been granted to a private landowner. Even after the settlement in the <i>Adams</i> litigation, however, respondents continued to search for evidence of a land patent that supported their claim of title. In 1991 they hired a genealogical record specialist to conduct research in the National Archives in Washington. The specialist found materials that, according to her, showed that on August 1, 1781, Bernardo de Galvez, then the Governor General of Spanish Louisiana, granted Horn Island to [a private party].</p>

They asked the court to set aside the 1982 settlement agreement and award them damages. . . . The District Court concluded that it was without jurisdiction to hear respondents’ suit and dismissed the complaint.</p>
	<p id="c0f98a8f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeals reversed. It concluded that there were two jurisdictional bases for the suit. First, the suit satisfied the elements of an “independent action,” as the term is used in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). . . . </p>
	<p id="c0f98a90-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Government’s primary contention is that the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that it had jurisdiction over respondents’ 1994 suit. It first attacks the lower court’s conclusion that jurisdiction was established because the suit was an “independent action” within the meaning of Rule 60(b). . . . [The Government argued that although] the District Court had jurisdiction over the original <i>Adams</i> litigation because the United States was the plaintiff, 28 U.S.C. §1345, there was no statutory basis for the Beggerlys’ 1994 action, and the District Court was therefore correct to have dismissed it.</p>
	<p id="c0f98a91-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think the Government’s position is inconsistent with the history and language of Rule 60(b). Prior to the 1937 adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the availability of relief from a judgment or order turned on whether the court was still in the same “term” in which the challenged judgment was entered. . . . If the term had expired, resort had to be made to a handful of writs, the precise contours of which were “shrouded in ancient lore and mystery.”  . . . </p>
	<p id="c0f98a92-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The 1946 Amendment [to Rule 60]. . . . made clear that nearly all of the old forms of obtaining relief from a judgment, i.e., coram nobis, coram vobis, audita querela, bills of review, and bills in the nature of review, had been abolished. The revision made equally clear, however, that one of the old forms, i.e., the “independent action,”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN110AA_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N110AA_d54426b4-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">2</a></span> still survived. The Advisory Committee notes confirmed this, indicating that “if the right to make a motion is lost by the expiration of the time limits fixed in these rules, the only other procedural remedy is by a new or independent action to set aside a judgment upon those principles which have heretofore been applied in such an action.”  . . . </p>
	<p id="c0f98a94-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Government is therefore wrong to suggest that an independent action brought in the same court as the original lawsuit requires an independent basis for jurisdiction. This is not to say, however, that the requirements for a meritorious independent action have been met here. If relief may be obtained through an independent action in a case such as this, where the most that may be charged against the Government is a failure to furnish relevant information that would at best form the basis for a Rule 60(b)(3) motion, the strict 1-year time limit on such motions would be set at naught. Independent actions must, if Rule 60(b) is to be interpreted as a coherent whole, be reserved for those cases of “injustices which, in certain instances, are deemed sufficiently gross to demand a departure” from rigid adherence to the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i>.

	<p id="c0f98a98-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The sense of these expressions is that, under the Rule, an independent action should be available only to prevent a grave miscarriage of justice. In this case, it should be obvious that respondents’ allegations do not nearly approach this demanding standard. Respondents allege only that the United States failed to “thoroughly search its records and make full disclosure to the Court” regarding the Boudreau grant. Whether such a claim might succeed under Rule 60(b)(3) we need not now decide; it surely would work no “grave miscarriage of justice,” and perhaps no miscarriage of justice at all, to allow the judgment to stand. We therefore hold that the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that this was a sufficient basis to justify the reopening of the judgment in the <i>Adams</i> litigation.</p>

Perhaps as a consequence, although the Rule itself does not make any distinction between judgments entered at different stages of the litigative process, the courts have in practice made a very sharp distinction between default judgments and others. The effect has been to make it comparatively easy to open a default judgment <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="770" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page770">p. 770</span>on the showing of some negligence and meritorious defense. (See <i>Peralta</i>, supra page 525, for an example.) Numerous decisions state, in one way or another, a very strong policy against judgments without consideration of the merits. Indeed, this policy is so strong that some practitioners advise against taking a default judgment unless there is absolutely no alternative. These lawyers have seen too many default judgments taken and defended in clear and justifiable circumstances, only to be set aside in the trial court or on appeal. The net result is considerable expense and a multiyear delay in the litigation.</p></li>

	<p id="c0fa0002-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q1.</b> B and C are correct. A is wrong because claim preclusion requires a judgment, and a settlement is not a judgment—and thus B is correct. C is correct because, if the release was properly drafted, GrowCo can plead it as an affirmative defense and bar Jane’s second suit.</p>
	<p id="c0fa0003-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q2.</b> A is correct. Because there was an answer (which is a “pleading”—see Rule 7), Rule 13(a) comes into play. Because Jane’s complaint alleged claims surrounding intellectual property in new plant strains, most courts would find that GrowCo’s claim concerning trade secrets involved the same transaction or occurrence or series of transactions or occurrences—and was therefore a compulsory counterclaim, waived when omitted from the answer.</p>
	<p id="c0fa0004-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q3.</b> B is correct. The civil case determined only that it was more likely than not that Student committed fraud. The issue in the criminal case will be whether a fact-finder can conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that fraud was committed—a different issue.</p>
	<p id="c0fa0005-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q4.</b> Only A is correct. A is correct because federal courts not sitting in diversity attach broad preclusive effect to 12(b)(6) dismissals—precluding not only the claim brought but transactionally related claims that could be brought. (Here the state law claim could have come into federal court under supplemental jurisdiction.) The second court—state or federal—must give the federal judgment the scope the rendering court would give it. B is wrong because a state court is bound to give the federal judgment the same preclusive effect as the court that rendered it. C is wrong because a 12(b)(6) motion addresses only whether the complaint states a claim.</p>
	<p id="c0fa0006-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q5.</b> A is the correct response. Borrower <i>B</i> can bring her claim because she has not had an opportunity to present her claim. B is wrong because the first lawsuit established only that Borrower <i>A</i> did not so persuade the court; Borrower <i>B</i> is entitled to her own day in court.</p>
	<p id="c0fa0007-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="773" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page773">p. 773</span><b>Q6.</b> B and C are correct. A is wrong because Borrower <i>B</i> has a right to bring his own claim; there is no requirement of joinder. B is correct for the reason just stated. C is correct because federal courts have allowed nonmutual issue preclusion; so long as Lender’s opportunity and incentive to litigate were similar in the first and second suits, and Borrower <i>B</i> could not have joined Borrower <i>A</i>’s suit, preclusion on this issue will apply.</p>
	<p id="c0fa0008-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q7.</b> D is the only correct response. A is wrong because although Frier’s due process claim might be precluded (as the court held), Roommate’s isn’t. B is wrong because Lawsuit #1 established only whether Frier was entitled to get his car back. C is wrong because Frier’s entitlement to get his car back will have no bearing on whether the City violated due process.</p>
	<p id="c0fa0009-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q8.</b> Only A is correct. The court’s decision in Frier’s case will have precedential effect (whether that effect is binding or only persuasive will depend on what court issued the ruling). B is wrong because the ability to join Frier’s claim is not sufficient to warrant claim preclusion (see <i>Taylor v. Sturgell</i>). C is wrong because issue preclusion cannot be asserted against one not a party to the prior suit.</p>

Indeed, differences in available procedures may sometimes justify not allowing a prior judgment to have estoppel effect in a subsequent action even between the same parties, or where defensive estoppel is asserted against a plaintiff who has litigated and lost. The problem of unfairness is particularly acute in cases of offensive estoppel, however, because the defendant against whom estoppel is asserted typically will not have chosen the forum in the first action.

	<p id="c0ff302a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This section combines the approaches taken in the two sections that precede it. Part I took a top-down view, looking at the ways in which the U.S. Constitution establishes constraints for civil litigation. Part II started at the bottom, taking the individual lawsuit as its unit of examination.</p>
	<p id="c0ff302b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We turn now to opportunities and problems that arise when procedural rules expand the confines of a lawsuit. Our forum for that examination is the rules of joinder, the principles that allow parties to modern civil litigation to combine claims and add additional parties. Those principles constitute one of the respects in which contemporary civil litigation differs sharply from its predecessors: A modern lawsuit can, to a large extent, aim at resolving an entire dispute by encompassing all the claims and all the parties involved.</p>
	<p id="c0ff302c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those same principles, however, challenge both the jurisdictional scheme elaborated in Part I and the litigation process explored in Part II. In many cases jurisdictional problems will either limit or defeat joinder that would otherwise be available. From one standpoint, these limitations are undesirable restrictions on a lawsuit that would otherwise provide a comprehensive resolution to a dispute. From another <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="776" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page776">p. 776</span>standpoint, jurisdictional limits prevent what might otherwise become a monster from devouring both the court system and the litigants swept into it. Joinder poses a similar issue for the design of the procedural system. Flexible joinder rules permit parties to frame issues broadly and to include everyone who has a stake in the resolution of those issues. Carried to its logical conclusion, however, this principle of inclusion can create a lawsuit that cannot resolve anything—because it is unmanageable. The Rules consequently walk a fine line, seeking broad inclusion but trying to keep inclusiveness from preventing resolution of the dispute.</p>
	<p id="c0ff302d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issues thus raised provide a review of much of this course. At the threshold of many cases will be both a pleading problem and a jurisdictional problem. The pleading problem will require you to consider whether the party or claim fits within the joinder rule’s definition. If it does, there will sometimes be a second level of inquiry: Assuming that the party or claim can be joined as a matter of pleading, does the court’s jurisdictional reach extend far enough to allow joinder of this claim or this party? Just beyond the pleading and jurisdictional inquiries may lie a question about claim or issue preclusion—one party seeking to achieve it, another to avoid it by manipulating joinder rules. This interplay among principles already explored makes joinder challenging—and useful as a test of your grasp of the preceding material.</p>

	<p id="c1001a8f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Modern civil procedure in the United States has three distinguishing features. One, notice pleading (to the extent it survives <i>Iqbal</i>), allows plaintiffs to start lawsuits with less than complete information. The second, discovery, increases the factual depth of any given lawsuit. The third, broad joinder of claims and parties, increases the breadth of a suit. To achieve this breadth, modern process turned from the single-mindedness of common law procedure to focus on the transaction rather than on the writ or legal theory. This focus permits parties to combine various claims. A larger litigative package confers advantages: It allows a court in a single suit to adjudicate multiple claims against multiple parties and for litigation to reflect some of life’s complexity. Disadvantages can also flow from this freedom: Litigation can become intricate, and considerable procedural skirmishing can occur long before the merits come into view, as parties dispute whether a particular party or claim is properly joined.</p>

We first consider joinder issues in the context of a lawsuit between a single plaintiff and a <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="778" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page778">p. 778</span>single defendant.

	<p id="c10041a7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At common law the rules governing joinder of claims were simple: Plaintiff could join only claims using the same writ but could do so regardless of whether the claims were factually related. For example, plaintiff could join claims for assaults on two separate occasions or a slander on one day and an act of negligence months later (because both used the same writ), but could not join a claim for assault with a claim for slander, even if both arose from the same incident, because slander and assault required different writs. Plaintiff also could join alternative versions of the same grievance by alleging each in a separate count, as if each count referred to a separate occurrence. But, again, each version had to be within the same form of action; plaintiff could not set forth one count in assumpsit and another in trover, even if both arose from the same allegedly wrongful taking. This principle becomes more understandable if one remembers that different writs used different forms of pretrial and trial processes and that the goal of much common law procedure was to frame a single, straightforward question for the jury. Also bear in mind that the scope of former adjudication was correspondingly narrow (see supra page 704).</p>
	<p id="c10041a8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At common law, a mistake in joinder had severe consequences. Misjoinder could lead to dismissal or even the upsetting of a verdict; the defect was not waived by failure to make an early objection. One can still find cases from the early twentieth century throwing out verdicts because of misjoinder.</p>
	<p id="c10041a9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As noted in Chapters 5 and 6, as England emerged into the modern era there were separate courts for law and equity. Each operated its own system: If, for example, one wanted specific performance of a contract, one went to Chancery, the court system that administered equitable remedies, such as injunctions. If one wanted instead damages as a remedy for breach of contract, one went to the courts of common law—King’s (or Queen’s) Bench and Common Pleas, as they were known. For present purposes, the critical point is that courts of equity were more relaxed than courts of law regarding joinder; indeed, its broader scope was one reason for parties’ resort to claims for relief that brought claims into courts of equity. Although standards for joinder in equity were never made completely clear, joinder was generally permitted when claims shared a transactional relationship and raised common issues. There were limits, however, and a bill in equity could be found objectionable for <i>multifariousness</i>, meaning that it combined too many claims.</p>

	<p id="c10041ac-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Rules changed all this: They eliminated all barriers to joinder of claims by a plaintiff. Read Rule 18. A single plaintiff can join any and all claims he has against a single defendant. This freedom can create trial management problems. If one <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="779" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page779">p. 779</span>imagines a case between Amazon or Microsoft and one of its major business partners, the possibilities are mind-boggling. The Rules solve this problem by permitting the judge, under Rule 42(b), to sever claims for trial convenience. Such severed claims may be as distinct for pretrial and trial purposes as if the plaintiff had brought entirely separate suits.</p>
	<p id="c10041ad-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although Rule 18 permits joinder, it does not compel it. So far as the <i>Rules</i> are concerned, there is no compulsory joinder of claims. The Rules do not, however, tell the whole story. The principles of claim preclusion, explored in Chapter 11, force a plaintiff to join related claims: If the plaintiff fails to join a claim, and a later court finds it is related to one adjudicated, it will be barred. Moreover, plaintiff will often want to join all claims, or at least all related claims, he has against a defendant for efficiency’s sake. The combination of these two factors creates a powerful incentive for plaintiffs to join claims, even in the absence of a Rule requiring that they do so.</p>

	<p id="c10041b0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although preclusion and strategy encourage broad joinder, jurisdiction sometimes presents an obstacle. Review of a few fundamental propositions may be helpful in setting the stage.</p>
	<p id="c10041b1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Assume Ann, a citizen of Illinois, sues Barbara, also a citizen of Illinois, on a federal claim. Can <i>A</i> join a state claim against <i>B</i>? That question poses two sub-questions: (1) Do the Rules permit combining these claims?; and (2) Assuming the Rules allow joinder, does the federal court have jurisdiction over the state claim thus joined?</p>
	<p id="c10041b2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 18 creates no joinder problem in this situation because it permits a plaintiff to join as many claims as she wishes, whether related or unrelated. The problem is jurisdictional: The court may lack subject matter jurisdiction over Ann’s state law claim.</p>
	<p id="c10041b3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recall that federal courts have limited jurisdiction: They do not have jurisdiction unless a provision of the Constitution and a statute grant it to them. In the example above, the basis for jurisdiction over the plaintiff’s original claim is straightforward: It arises under federal law, over which Article III and 28 U.S.C. §1331 confer jurisdiction.</p>
	<p id="c10068c4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Jurisdiction over the state law claim is more difficult. There is no diversity of citizenship between plaintiff and defendant. The claim arises under state rather than federal law, so there is no federal question jurisdiction. If there is jurisdiction, it exists only by virtue of the supplemental jurisdiction conferred by 28 U.S.C. §1367. Read that statute and consider what question would have to be answered to resolve the jurisdictional issue here.</p>
	<p id="c10068c5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 1367 has a particularly important feature for our exploration of joinder. Its grant of supplemental jurisdiction depends on four variables: (1) the relationship between the original claim and the claim to be joined; (2) the basis of the original jurisdiction over the case; (3) the identity of the party—plaintiff or defendant—seeking to invoke supplemental jurisdiction; and (4) the Rule authorizing the joinder of the party or claim over whom supplemental jurisdiction is sought. <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="780" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page780">p. 780</span>In the sections below, we will have repeated occasion to explore these variables; in order to gain a basic orientation, consider some elementary problems.

Such problems of personal jurisdiction will affect the ability of both state and federal courts to hear joined claims. As a quick review of jurisdictional concepts, explain why §1367 will not help with such problems of personal jurisdiction. The litigants and the courts must apply the ordinary principles of personal jurisdiction: If Edith lacks sufficient contacts with California, she can’t be joined to a suit brought in that state.</p></li>

At common law, the rules governing defendant’s claims were simple: They did not exist. The defendant who had a claim against plaintiff could bring a separate suit or, in a limited number of cases, “set off” her claim against the plaintiff’s (that is, reduce the plaintiff’s recovery) but could not herself recover in the original action. Today Rule 13 permits—and sometimes requires—defendants to assert such claims. Rule 13 divides counterclaims into two categories, <i>compulsory</i> and <i>permissive</i>. Read the Rule and then read the next case. As you do, consider what it means for a counterclaim to be compulsory and why it matters.</p>

	<p id="c100de1c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As noted, federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, and absent jurisdiction conferred by statute, they lack the power to adjudicate claims. Supplemental jurisdiction permits a federal court to entertain a claim over which it would not have an independent basis of subject matter jurisdiction. In 1990, Congress passed the supplemental jurisdiction statute, 28 U.S.C. §1367, which provides that in any case properly brought in federal court, the district court “shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the <i>same case or controversy</i> under Article III.” §1367(a) (emphasis added).</p>
	<p id="c100de1d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs focus their argument on the contention that because the counterclaims are permissive under Rule 13, the counterclaims must have an independent basis for jurisdiction to be brought in this action. Rule 13 divides counterclaims into two basic categories: compulsory and permissive. If the counterclaim “arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party’s claim,” then the party must either assert it under the compulsory counterclaim provision in Rule 13(a) or waive the right to recover on it. It is well established that federal courts have supplemental jurisdiction over compulsory counterclaims because to be compulsory <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="784" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page784">p. 784</span>counterclaims in the first place, they have already passed the more stringent test of arising out of the same “transaction or occurrence” as the jurisdiction-invoking claim, and therefore, by definition, satisfy §1367(a)’s “same case or controversy” standard.</p>
	<p id="c100de1e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the defendant’s claim is independent of the plaintiff’s claim, however, then the defendant has the option of bringing it in a separate suit or of asserting it under Rule 13(b) as a permissive counterclaim. In contrast to compulsory counterclaims, permissive counterclaims must either be supported by independent grounds of federal jurisdiction <i>or</i> fall within the supplemental jurisdiction of the court under 28 U.S.C. §1367.</p>
	<p id="c100de1f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs’ argument ignores §1367. Before Section 1367 was passed in 1990, courts, including the Fifth Circuit, routinely held that permissive counterclaims required an independent jurisdictional basis before a federal court could exercise subject matter jurisdiction over such claims. . . . Although the Fifth Circuit has not addressed the issue, the consensus among the courts of appeals and the numerous district courts that have considered the issue is that §1367 supersedes case law on supplemental jurisdiction, and it is no longer the case that permissive counterclaims must be supported by an independent basis for jurisdiction, but rather must only meet the test for supplemental jurisdiction under §1367(a). Thus. . . . “the appropriate focus should be whether the counterclaims satisfy the requirements of §1367—that is, whether the state law claims are so related to a federal claim as to form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the Constitution—rather than on whether the counterclaim is compulsory or permissive.”  . . . </p>

Voltaire alleges that Cordero committed fraud by submitting work statements to it with “falsified and inflated hours,” and that he submitted bills for time and expenses that were expended on personal and private projects. . . . To prove his FLSA claim, Cordero will have to present evidence showing how many hours he worked, how much he was paid for those hours and how much he should have been paid for those hours. Similarly, to prove its fraud counterclaim, Voltaire will have to present evidence showing that Cordero billed it for false and/or inflated hours and for work expended on personal and private projects. Thus, both claims focus on whether Cordero is owed overtime compensation under the Act and if so, the amount actually owed. . . . Based upon the foregoing, the Court recommends that the District Court deny Plaintiff Cordero’s Motion to Dismiss Defendant’s fraud counterclaim for lack of jurisdiction.</p>

Voltaire’s counterclaims do not share common facts with the FLSA claims and a different body of evidence will be required to prove those claims. The only nexus between the FLSA claims and Voltaire’s counterclaims is the employment relationship between the parties. “The mere fact that the parties were once linked by an employer-employee relationship is insufficient when the claims would stir such different issues and rely on such different facts and evidence.” Thus, numerous courts have found that there was no supplemental jurisdiction over unrelated counterclaims in FLSA actions.</p>

This is an implication of calling a counterclaim compulsory. Some say that an unbrought counterclaim later held to be compulsory is precluded by doctrines of former adjudication.

Instead, most cases are like <i>Cordero</i>: Plaintiffs assert a federal claim; defendant interposes counterclaims under state law for which there is no independent federal jurisdiction; plaintiffs move to dismiss the counterclaims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction; and defendant argues that the counterclaims are compulsory and, thus, within the supplemental jurisdiction of the federal court.</p></li>

Pursuant thereto, the EEOC made a reasonable cause finding that General Motors, Fisher Body Division and Chevrolet Division, and the Union had engaged in unlawful employment practices in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Accordingly, the charging parties were notified by EEOC of their right to institute a civil action in the appropriate federal district court. . . . </p>

All of the individual plaintiffs requested injunctive relief, back pay, attorneys’ fees and costs. Counts XI and XII of the complaint were class action counts against the two individual divisions of General Motors. They also sought declaratory and injunctive relief, back pay, attorneys’ fees and costs. . . . </p>
	<p id="c1012c70-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The district court ordered that “insofar as the first ten counts are concerned, those ten counts shall be severed into ten separate causes of action,” and each plaintiff was directed to bring a separate action based upon his complaint, duly and separately filed. The court also ordered that the class action would not be dismissed, but rather would be left open “to each of the plaintiffs herein, individually or collectively. . . . to allege a separate cause of action on behalf of any class of persons which such plaintiff or plaintiffs may separately or individually represent.”</p>
	<p id="c1012c71-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In reaching this conclusion on joinder, the district court followed the reasoning of <i>Smith v. North American Rockwell Corp</i>. which, in a somewhat analogous situation, found there was no right to relief arising out of the same transaction, occurrence or series of transactions or occurrences, and that there was no question of law or fact common to all plaintiffs sufficient to sustain joinder under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 20(a). Similarly, the district court here felt that the plaintiffs’ joint actions against General Motors and the Union presented a variety of issues having little relationship to one another; that they had only one common problem, i.e., the defendant; and that as pleaded the joint actions were completely unmanageable. Upon entering the order, and upon application of the plaintiffs, the district court found that its decision involved a controlling question of law as to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion and that any of the parties might make application for appeal under 28 U.S.C. §1292(b).

In this manner, the scope of the civil action is made a matter for the discretion of the district court, and a determination on the question of joinder of parties will be reversed on appeal only upon a showing of abuse of that discretion. To determine whether the district court’s order was proper herein, we must look to the policy and law that have developed around the operation of Rule 20.</p>
	<p id="c1012c78-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The purpose of the rule is to promote trial convenience and expedite the final determination of disputes, thereby preventing multiple lawsuits. 7 C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure §1652, at 265 (1972). Single trials generally tend to lessen the delay, expense and inconvenience to all concerned. Reflecting this policy, the Supreme Court has said: “Under the Rules, the impulse is toward entertaining the broadest possible scope of action consistent with fairness to the parties; joinder of claims, parties and remedies is strongly encouraged.” United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715 (1966).</p>
	<p id="c1012c79-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Permissive joinder is not, however, applicable in all cases. The rule imposes two specific requisites to the joinder of parties: (1) a right to relief must be asserted by, or against, each plaintiff or defendant relating to or arising out of the <i>same transaction or occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences;</i> and (2) <i>some question of law or fact common</i> to all the parties must arise in the action.</p>
	<p id="c101528a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In ascertaining whether a particular factual situation constitutes a single transaction or occurrence for purposes of Rule 20, a case by case approach is generally pursued. 7 C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure §1653, at 270 (1972). No hard and fast rules have been established under the rule. However, construction of the terms “transaction or occurrence” as used in the context of Rule 13(a) counterclaims offers some guide to the application of this test. For the purposes of the latter rule, “’Transaction’ is a word of flexible meaning. It may comprehend a series of many occurrences, depending not so much upon the immediateness of their connection as upon their logical relationship.” Moore v. New York Cotton Exchange, 270 U.S. 593 (1926). Accordingly, all “logically related” events entitling a person to institute a legal action against another generally are regarded as comprising a transaction or occurrence. 7 C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure §1653, at 270 (1972). The analogous interpretation of the terms as used in Rule 20 would permit all reasonably related claims for relief by or against different parties to be tried in a single proceeding. Absolute identity of all events is unnecessary.</p>
	<p id="c101528b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This construction accords with the result reached in United States v. Mississippi, 380 U.S. 128 (1965), a suit brought by the United States against the State of Mississippi, the election commissioners, and six voting registrars of the State, charging them with engaging in acts and practices hampering and destroying the right of black citizens of Mississippi to vote. The district court concluded that the complaint improperly attempted to hold the six county registrars jointly liable for what amounted to nothing more than individual torts committed by them separately against separate applicants. In reversing, the Supreme Court said:</p>
	<div class="epub-blockquote">
	<p id="c101528c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the complaint charged that the registrars had acted and were continuing to act as part of a state-wide system designed to enforce the registration laws in a way that would <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="791" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page791">p. 791</span>inevitably deprive colored people of the right to vote solely because of their color. On such an allegation the joinder of all the registrars as defendants in a single suit is authorized by Rule 20(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. . . . These registrars were alleged to be carrying on activities which were part of a series of transactions or occurrences the validity of which depended to a large extent upon “question[s] of law or fact common to all of them.”</p>
	</div>
	<p id="c101528d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here too, then, the plaintiffs have asserted a right to relief arising out of the same transactions or occurrences. Each of the ten plaintiffs alleged that he had been injured by the same general policy of discrimination on the part of General Motors and the Union. Since a “state-wide system designed to enforce the registration laws in a way that would inevitably deprive colored people of the right to vote” was determined to arise out of the same series of transactions or occurrences, we conclude that a company-wide policy purportedly designed to discriminate against blacks in employment similarly arises out of the same series of transactions or occurrences. Thus the plaintiffs meet the first requisite for joinder under Rule 20(a).</p>
	<p id="c101528e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second requisite necessary to sustain a permissive joinder under the rule is that a question of law or fact common to all the parties will arise in the action. The rule does not require that <i>all</i> questions of law and fact raised by the dispute be common. Yet, neither does it establish any qualitative or quantitative test of commonality. For this reason, cases construing the parallel requirement under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) provide a helpful framework for construction of the commonality required by Rule 20. In general, those cases that have focused on Rule 23(a)(2) have given it a permissive application so that common questions have been found to exist in a wide range of contexts. 7 C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure §1763 at 604 (1972). Specifically, with respect to employment discrimination cases under Title VII, courts have found that the discriminatory character of a defendant’s conduct is basic to the class, and the fact that the individual class members may have suffered different effects from the alleged discrimination is immaterial for the purposes of the prerequisite. <i>Hicks v.

	<p id="c1015290-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The right to relief here depends on the ability to demonstrate that each of the plaintiffs was wronged by racially discriminatory policies on the part of the defendants General Motors and the Union. The discriminatory character of the defendants’ conduct is thus basic to each plaintiff’s recovery. The fact that each plaintiff may have suffered different effects from the alleged discrimination is immaterial for the purposes of determining the common question of law or fact. Thus, we conclude that the second requisite for joinder under Rule 20(a) is also met by the complaint.</p>

The Plaintiffs are residents of five different cities and four different states who worked in four separate AT&amp;T offices located in three states. While the Plaintiffs were directly supervised by different managers in each office, it appears they were indirectly supervised by the same centralized PIP upper management group. The Plaintiffs contend the PIP management systematically discriminated against them because of their sex and allege discriminatory actions by some of the same individuals in PIP management. However, the Plaintiffs identify no specific discriminatory policy or practice to which they were all subjected. In addition to the claims of sex discrimination, Plaintiff Harryman asserts claims of race, age, and national origin discrimination, while Plaintiff Bryan asserts a claim of age discrimination. All the Plaintiffs also assert various state law claims against the Defendants.

AT&amp;T further contends that in a single trial, the jury will hear evidence that may be relevant to the claims of one Plaintiff, but that is completely irrelevant and prejudicial to the claims of the remaining Plaintiffs. According to AT&amp;T, a single trial will unnecessarily complicate evidentiary rulings and will deprive this Court of its discretion to rule on the admissibility of marginally relevant but highly prejudicial evidence.</p>

Assume <i>A</i> has similar claims against <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>.

The causes of action against Latco include breach of the construction contract, fraudulent misrepresentation of the caliber of materials to be used, and negligence and wantonness in the construction. Latco moved to file a Third Party Complaint against, inter alios, ITW on February 21, 2001, approximately six months after the case had been removed to the Middle District of Alabama. . . . In the Third Party Complaint, Latco alleges that ITW, a nail manufacturer, defectively designed the nails used in the construction of the chicken houses. The specific causes of action include breach of warranty, violation of the Alabama Extended Manufacturer’s Liability Doctrine, and common law indemnity. ITW argues that it was improperly impleaded under Rule 14 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or, alternatively, that the Third Party Complaint is barred by the equitable doctrine of laches.</p>
	<p id="c101c7e7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under Rule 14(a), a defendant may assert a claim against anyone not a party to the original action if that third party’s liability is in some way dependent upon the outcome of the original action. There is a limitation on this general statement, however. Even though it may arise out of the same general set of facts as the main claim, a third party claim will not be permitted when it is based upon a separate and independent claim. Rather, the third party liability must in some way be derivative of the original claim; a third party may be impleaded only when the original defendant is trying to pass all or part of the liability onto that third party.</p>
	<p id="c101c7e8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Latco argues that ITW is the prototypical third party defendant under Rule 14. It asserts that ITW can be found liable for the warranty surrounding its products if Latco is first found liable for faulty construction. Furthermore, insists Latco, this derivative liability merely involves a shift in the overall responsibility of the allegedly defective chicken houses. ITW contends, however, that because Rule 14 is merely a procedural rule, the propriety of its application depends upon the existence of a right to indemnity under the substantive law. ITW accurately states the law in this regard, but its conclusion that there is no viable substantive claim under Alabama law is incorrect.</p>
	<p id="c101c7e9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Conceding that Alabama does not recognize a right to contribution among joint tortfeasors, Latco directs the court’s attention to the concept of implied contractual indemnity. Under this doctrine, Alabama courts recognize that a manufacturer of a product has impliedly agreed to indemnify the seller when 1) the seller is without fault, 2) the manufacturer is responsible, and 3) the seller has been required to pay a monetary judgment. Under Latco’s theory, should it be found liable for its construction of the chicken houses, it can demonstrate that the true fault lies with the nail guns and the nails manufactured by ITW.</p>
	<p id="c101c7ea-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alabama case law, not to mention the parties’ briefs, is especially sparse with respect to the contours of the doctrine of implied indemnity. . . . [The opinion went on to find that Alabama’s law resembled that of Illinois on the point in question and that Illinois would permit a claim for implied indemnity under the circumstances of the case.] The court finds that Alabama law provides Latco a cause of action under common law indemnity against ITW.</p>
	<p id="c101c7eb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It must be noted, however, that, under Alabama law, the doctrine permits recovery only when the party to be indemnified is “without fault.” Whether, in fact, <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="796" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page796">p. 796</span>such a factual scenario will be proven at trial is irrelevant for present purposes. The only issue before the court is whether there exists a legal basis to implead ITW, not whether ITW is, in fact, liable to Latco. Since Rule 14 permits Latco to implead any party who “may be liable,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 14(a), it follows that the court must permit development of the factual record so the extent of that liability may be determined. . . . </p>
	<p id="c101c7ec-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Furthermore, since Latco has established a basis upon which it may properly implead ITW, the court need not address the applicability of Rule 14 to the other claims in Latco’s Third Party Complaint. It is well established that a properly impleaded claim may serve as an anchor for separate and independent claims under Rule 18(a).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN104AD_d5444dc6-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N104AD_d5444dc6-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">3</a></span>. . . . In short, the court finds that Latco has properly impleaded ITW under Rule 14(a).

Less obviously, it gives such defendants a way of delaying the case and making litigation more expensive for the plaintiff by adding another party. Inevitably, a three-party case will take longer than a two-party case: For the added party there will be a flurry of pleadings and related motions; there will be additional discovery; scheduling three sets of lawyers’ meetings increases time conflicts exponentially; and so on. Moreover, from the plaintiff’s standpoint, this added delay and expense does nothing for her, so long as she has identified a solvent defendant and has a strong claim. Impleader is for defendant’s benefit. Not surprisingly, then, plaintiffs are often unenthusiastic about defendant’s impleading additional parties. (Footnote 3 of <i>Price</i> exemplifies the concerns that plaintiffs may have.)</p>

Yes, the construction company now has someone who may pay all or part of the damages if the chicken houses are judged defective. But the construction company now has <i>two</i> parties who will bend their litigative efforts to showing that the construction was shoddy: In addition to the plaintiff, the nail manufacturer will want to show that poor construction practices, not bad nails, caused the houses to fail.</p>

If that isn’t enough, Rule 4(k)(1)(B) gives an extra 100-mile boost to the court’s jurisdiction. Read that provision and apply it to the following situation. Plaintiff sues Defendant, a Pennsylvania corporation, in federal court in Philadelphia, alleging a breach of contract arising out of some work Defendant performed in Wilmington, Delaware, about 35 miles south of Philadelphia. Defendant wants to implead Employee, who lives and works in Wilmington, and has insufficient contacts with Pennsylvania to subject him to personal jurisdiction there.

If a claim carries with it an independent jurisdictional basis, that question is quickly resolved. For example, if a crossclaim arises under federal law, there will be no problem. Similarly, if a defendant/third-party plaintiff and a third-party defendant meet the requirements of diversity of citizenship, there will be no difficult jurisdictional issue. But what happens if the federal court would not otherwise have jurisdiction over a compulsory counterclaim, third-party claim, or crossclaim? Does supplemental jurisdiction extend to cover these essentially defensive claims? In many circumstances, the answer is yes. Section 1367 permits many, but not all, defensive claims to come in under the umbrella of supplemental jurisdiction. Reread that provision and explain why a federal district court will always have subject matter jurisdiction over Nails and SteelCo in the hypothetical in Note 5.</p></li>

But what if Price and Nails are citizens of the same state? No supplemental jurisdiction. To understand why, look at §1367(b), which precludes supplemental jurisdiction in diversity-only cases “over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under Rule 14  . . . ” if doing so would defeat diversity. This restriction predated the statute; the Supreme Court made clear, in Owen Equipment &amp; Erection Co. v. Kroger, 437 U.S. 365 (1978), that allowing such a claim would “[d]estroy complete diversity just as surely as if [the plaintiff] had sued the [third-party defendant] initially.” As the Court reasoned:</p>

	<p id="c1023d47-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is a fundamental precept that federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. The limits upon federal jurisdiction, whether imposed by the Constitution or by Congress, must be neither disregarded nor evaded.

Several courts and commentators have suggested that the drafters of the statute did not intend to preclude supplemental jurisdiction under these circumstances. But, so far, courts have held that the plain language of the statute controls, and Farmer is out of luck.</p></li>

We now consider whether there are those who must be joined—even if neither they nor those already in the suit desire to see them there. The topic, sometimes rather confusingly described in terms of “necessary and indispensable parties,” has its roots in eighteenth-century equity practice. Chancery developed the perfectly sensible notions that (1) litigation sometimes affected people who weren’t formal parties; and (2) if the effects were serious enough and the affected persons could be joined, they should be. Rule 19 now embodies these propositions. Reading the Rule might leave one with the impression that it requires courts in every case to consider the most efficient and effective party structure for a lawsuit.

For present purposes, courts of equity came from a tradition in which judges did not just decide which party had presented the stronger case, but tried, as best they could, to assure that justice was done. Out of this quest came the idea that sometimes there was a party not presently in the suit who should be.

The device was <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="803" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page803">p. 803</span>manufactured by respondent Synthes, Ltd. (U.S.A.) (Synthes), a Pennsylvania corporation. Dr. S. Henry LaRocca performed the surgery at St. Charles General Hospital in New Orleans, Louisiana. Following surgery, the device’s screws broke off inside Temple’s back.</p>
	<p id="c1028b7b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Temple filed suit against Synthes in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. The suit, which rested on diversity jurisdiction, alleged defective design and manufacture of the device. At the same time, Temple filed a state administrative proceeding against Dr. LaRocca and the hospital for malpractice and negligence. At the conclusion of the administrative proceeding, Temple filed suit against the doctor and the hospital in Louisiana state court.</p>
	<p id="c1028b7c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Synthes did not attempt to bring the doctor and the hospital into the federal action by means of a third-party complaint, as provided in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 14(a). Instead, Synthes filed a motion to dismiss Temple’s federal suit for failure to join necessary parties pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19. Following a hearing, the District Court ordered Temple to join the doctor and the hospital as defendants within twenty days or risk dismissal of the lawsuit. According to the court, the most significant reason for requiring joinder was the interest of judicial economy. The court relied on this Court’s decision in Provident Tradesmens Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Patterson, 390 U.S. 102 (1968), wherein we recognized that one focus of Rule 19 is “the interest of the courts and the public in complete, consistent, and efficient settlement of controversies.” When Temple failed to join the doctor and the hospital, the court dismissed the suit with prejudice.</p>
	<p id="c1028b7d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Temple appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. The court deemed it “obviously prejudicial to the defendants to have the separate litigations being carried on,” because Synthes’ defense might be that the plate was not defective but that the doctor and the hospital were negligent, while the doctor and hospital, on the other hand, might claim that they were not negligent but that the plate was defective. The Court of Appeals found that claims overlapped and that the District Court therefore had not abused its discretion in ordering joinder under Rule 19. A petition for rehearing was denied.</p>
	<p id="c1028b7e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In his petition for certiorari to this Court, Temple contends that it was error to label joint tortfeasors as indispensable parties under Rule 19(b) and to dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice for failure to join those parties. We agree. Synthes does not deny that it, the doctor, and the hospital are potential joint tortfeasors. It has long been the rule that it is not necessary for all joint tortfeasors to be named as defendants in a single lawsuit. Nothing in the 1966 revision of Rule 19 changed that principle.

There, the estate of a tort victim brought a declaratory judgment action against an insurance company. We assumed that the policyholder was a person “who, under. . . . [Rule 19](a), should be joined if ‘feasible’” and went on to discuss the appropriate analysis under Rule 19(b), because the policyholder could not be joined without destroying diversity.

As potential joint tortfeasors with Synthes, Dr. LaRocca and the hospital were merely permissive parties. The Court of Appeals erred by failing to hold that the District Court abused its discretion in ordering them joined as defendants and in dismissing the action when Temple failed to comply with the court’s order. For these reasons, we grant the petition for certiorari, reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

(Helzberg), a Missouri corporation, and Valley West Des Moines Shopping Center, Inc. (Valley West), an Iowa corporation, executed a written Lease Agreement. The Lease Agreement granted Helz­berg the right to operate a full line jewelry store at space 254 in the Valley West Mall in West Des Moines, Iowa.

On November 2, 1976, Valley West and Kirk’s Incorporated, Jewelers, an Iowa corporation, doing business as Lord’s Jewelers (Lord’s), entered into a written Lease Agreement.

The suit was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri. Subject matter jurisdiction was invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1332 based upon diversity of citizenship between the parties and an amount in controversy which exceeded [the statutory amount].

	<p id="c10300d5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From this order Valley West appeals.</p>
	<p id="c10300d6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is clear that Valley West is entitled to appeal from the order granting preliminary injunctive relief. 28 U.S.C. §1292(a)(1). However, Valley West does not attack the propriety of the issuance of a preliminary injunction directly; instead, it challenges the District Court’s denial of its motion to dismiss for failure to join an indispensable party and argues that the District Court’s order fails for lack of specificity in describing the acts of Valley West to be restrained. . . . </p>
	<p id="c10300d7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because Helzberg was seeking and the District Court ordered injunctive relief which may prevent Lord’s from operating its jewelry store in the Valley West Mall in the manner in which Lord’s originally intended, the District Court correctly concluded that Lord’s was a party to be joined if feasible. See Rule 19(a)[(1)(b)<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10772_d5444dc6-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10772_d5444dc6-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*2</a></span>](i), Fed. R. Civ. P. Therefore, because Lord’s was not and is not subject to personal jurisdiction in the Western District of Missouri, the District Court was required to determine whether or not Lord’s should be regarded as indispensable. After considering the <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="808" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page808">p. 808</span>factors which Rule 19(b) mandates be considered, the District Court concluded that Lord’s was not to be regarded as indispensable. We agree. . . . </p>
	<p id="c10300d9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 19(b) requires the court to look first to the extent to which a judgment rendered in Lord’s absence might be prejudicial to Lord’s or to Valley West. Valley West argues that the District Court’s order granting preliminary injunctive relief does prejudice Lord’s and may prejudice Valley West. We do not agree.</p>
	<p id="c10300da-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It seems axiomatic that none of Lord’s rights or obligations will be ultimately determined in a suit to which it is not a party. Even if, as a result of the District Court’s granting of the preliminary injunction, Valley West should attempt to terminate Lord’s leasehold interest in space 261 in the Valley West Mall, Lord’s will retain all of its rights under its Lease Agreement with Valley West. None of its rights or obligations will have been adjudicated as a result of the present proceedings, proceedings to which it is not a party. Therefore, we conclude that Lord’s will not be prejudiced in a way contemplated by Rule 19(b) as a result of this action.</p>
	<p id="c10300db-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Likewise, we think that Lord’s absence will not prejudice Valley West in a way contemplated by Rule 19(b). Valley West contends that it may be subjected to inconsistent obligations as a result of a determination in this action and a determination in another forum that Valley West should proceed in a fashion contrary to what has been ordered in these proceedings.</p>
	<p id="c10300dc-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is true that the obligations of Valley West to Helzberg, as determined in these proceedings, may be inconsistent with Valley West’s obligations to Lord’s. However, we are of the opinion that any inconsistency in those obligations will result from Valley West’s voluntary execution of two Lease Agreements which impose inconsistent obligations rather than from Lord’s absence from the present proceedings.</p>
	<p id="c10300dd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Helzberg seeks only to restrain Valley West’s breach of the Lease Agreement to which Helzberg and Valley West were the sole parties. Certainly, all of the rights and obligations arising under a lease can be adjudicated where all of the parties to the lease are before the court. Thus, in the context of these proceedings the District Court can determine all of the rights and obligations of both Helzberg and Valley West based upon the Lease Agreement between them, even though Lord’s is not a party to the proceedings.</p>
	<p id="c10300de-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Valley West’s contention that it may be subjected to inconsistent judgments if Lord’s should choose to file suit elsewhere and be awarded judgment is speculative at best. In the first place, Lord’s has not filed such a suit. Secondly, there is no showing that another court is likely to interpret the language of the two Lease Agreements differently from the way in which the District Court would. Therefore, we also conclude that Valley West will suffer no prejudice as a result of the District Court’s proceeding in Lord’s absence. Any prejudice which Valley West may suffer by way of inconsistent judgments would be the result of Valley West’s execution of Lease Agreements which impose inconsistent obligations and not the result of the proceedings in the District Court.</p>
	<p id="c10300df-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 19(b) also requires the court to consider ways in which prejudice to the absent party can be lessened or avoided. The District Court afforded Lord’s an opportunity to intervene in order to protect any interest it might have in the outcome of this litigation. Lord’s chose not to do so. In light of Lord’s decision not to intervene we conclude that the District Court acted in such a way as to sufficiently protect Lord’s interests.</p>

It follows that the District Court’s conclusion that in equity and good conscience the action should be allowed to proceed was a correct one.</p>
	<p id="c10327f1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, it is generally recognized that a person does not become indispensable to an action to determine rights under a contract simply because that person’s rights or obligations under an entirely separate contract will be affected by the result of the action. This principle applies to an action against a lessor who has entered into other leases which also may be affected by the result in the action in which the other lessees are argued to be indispensable parties. We conclude that the District Court properly denied the motion to dismiss for failure to join an indispensable party. . . . </p>
	<p id="c10327f2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In view of the foregoing, it follows that the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>

Faced with defending a lawsuit against Helzberg’s, it argued that <i>more</i> people should be suing it, but then with what one imagines were crocodile tears, regretfully noted that Lord’s could not be joined for jurisdictional reasons—and therefore the entire suit should be dismissed. The <i>Helzberg’s</i> court rejected this argument, but one regularly finds this stance taken in Rule 19 cases. A defendant argues (a) that to do perfect justice someone else should be joined to the lawsuit, (b) that for jurisdictional or other reasons that party cannot be joined, and (c) that the suit should therefore be dismissed. In so arguing, the litigants are echoing the views of eighteenth-century Lord Chancellors, who sometimes seemed to be saying that if their courts could not do perfect justice (by joining all who might have an interest in the suit), they would do none at all. The current Rule 19 was drafted in part to avoid this stance; see Rule 19(b).</p>

	<p id="c103762e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The joinder devices thus far explored have a common characteristic: They serve to bring into a lawsuit a party who does not want to be there. We turn now to a doctrine with the opposite function: to permit an unjoined person to elbow her way into a suit where no one wants her. Like the doctrines of compulsory joinder, the principles of intervention flow from a recognition that lawsuits may have effects on persons not joined. The effects will not be those of formal preclusion—due process forbids binding one who was not a party—but judgments have broader ripple effects than the formal binding effect of the decree.</p>
	<p id="c103762f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To take a common example, suppose that Developer and City Zoning Board are engaged in litigation over whether Developer can build an office building on a plot of land bordering a residential area. If Developer wins the suit, Homeowner, whose property lies next to the plot in question, will be affected. If Developer loses the suit, Landowner, who owns another adjacent plot of land that would be more valuable if it can be commercially developed, will be adversely affected. The resulting judgment will not formally bind either Homeowner or Landowner, but it will affect them. Both might wish to influence the outcome of the suit. If they were entitled to <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="813" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page813">p. 813</span>intervene, they would thereby become parties to the suit, with the right to present evidence and arguments in the same way as Developer and Zoning Board.</p>
	<p id="c1037630-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notice that Developer and Zoning Board (and perhaps the judge as well) may be notably unenthusiastic about intervention. From the standpoint of the existing parties, it complicates and perhaps weakens their litigating strategy. Even an intervenor who seeks the same outcome as one of the parties will have a different perspective and perhaps a different strategy. Moreover, additional parties may make the lawsuit more expensive and settlement more difficult. Conceptually, intervention means further erosion of the principle of party autonomy, and, carried to a logical extreme, turns every lawsuit into a town meeting at which anyone even distantly “interested” in the topic of litigation becomes a party. The principles of intervention seek to allow some—but not all—who might wish to be involved in a lawsuit to join it. Read Rule 24.</p>
	<p id="c1037631-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Note the structure of the Rule. It is subdivided into two major categories: intervention of right (Rule 24(a)) and permissive intervention (Rule 24(b)). Intervention of right is designed to give to those with strong interests in the litigation the power to insist on joinder. The words of Rule 24(a)(2) echo those of Rule 19(a)(1)(B)—"an interest relating to. . . . the subject of the action. . . . so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede” the interests of would-be intervenor. Permissive intervention is the weaker counterpart, as it is designed to capture those with weaker bases for insisting on joinder. As the words imply, an applicant who meets the criteria of Rule 24(a) must be allowed to join the lawsuit. An applicant who meets only the criteria of Rule 24(b) may be allowed to join, with the judge’s decision reviewed only for abuse of discretion.</p>
	<p id="c1037632-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most of the reported cases focus on Rule 24(a), the general criteria for intervention as of right. That section contains four requirements. The intervention must be timely—the intervenor may not lie in wait until the litigation is on the brink of resolution. Second, the intervenor must have an “interest” in the property or transaction that is the subject of the suit, and, third, that interest must be in some strong way at risk. Finally, even an applicant meeting all these criteria will be denied intervention if those already in the lawsuit are adequately representing the interest. The next case assumes that intervention is timely and analyzes the other three criteria.</p>

Either consequence would be felt by United Nuclear and to some degree, of course, by Kerr-McGee, which is said to be one of the largest holders of uranium properties in New Mexico. It operates a uranium mill in Grants, New Mexico, pursuant to an NMEIA license, which application for renewal is pending. A decision in favor of the plaintiffs, which is not unlikely, could have a profound effect upon Kerr-McGee. Hence, it does have an interest within the meaning of Rule 24(a)(2). This interest of Kerr-McGee is in sharp contrast to the minimal interest which was present in <i>Allard</i>, wherein it was an interest of environmental groups in the protection of living birds. This was considered insufficient to justify intervention in a case involving feathers which are part of Indian artifacts. Their interest was said to be limited to a general interest in the public.

They alleged that both had engaged in racially discriminatory hiring and promotion practices in various public service jobs in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other federal law. After a bench trial on some issues, but before judgment, the parties entered into two consent decrees, one between the black individuals and the City and the other between them and the Board. These proposed decrees set forth an extensive remedial scheme, including long-term and interim annual goals for the hiring of blacks as firefighters. The decrees also provided for goals for promotion of blacks within the department. The District Court entered an order provisionally approving the decrees and directing publication of notice of the upcoming fairness hearings. Notice of the hearings, with a reference to the general nature of the decrees, was published in two local newspapers. At that hearing, the Birmingham Firefighters Association (BFA) appeared and filed objections as amicus curiae. After the hearing, but before final approval of the decrees, the BFA and two of its members also moved to intervene on the ground that the decrees would adversely affect their rights. The District Court denied the motions as untimely and approved the decrees. Seven white firefighters, all members of the BFA, then filed a complaint against the City and the Board seeking injunctive relief against enforcement of the decrees. The seven argued that the decrees would operate to illegally discriminate against them; the District Court denied relief. . . . </p>
	<p id="c10438c1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A new group of white firefighters, the <i>Wilks</i> respondents, then brought suit against the City and the Board in District Court. They too alleged that, because of their race, they were being denied promotions in favor of less qualified blacks in violation of federal law. The Board and the City admitted to making race conscious employment decisions, but argued the decisions were unassailable because they were made pursuant to the consent decrees. A group of black individuals, the <i>Martin</i> petitioners, were allowed to intervene in their individual capacities to defend the decrees.</p>

It makes sense, therefore, to place on them a burden of bringing in additional parties where such a step is indicated, rather than placing on potential additional parties a duty to intervene when they acquire knowledge of the lawsuit. The linchpin of the “impermissible collateral attack” doctrine—the attribution of preclusive effect to a failure to intervene—is therefore quite inconsistent with Rule 19 and Rule 24. . . . </p>

	<p id="c10438ce-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners contend that a different result should be reached because the need to join affected parties will be burdensome and ultimately discouraging to civil rights litigation. Potential adverse claimants may be numerous and difficult to identify; if they are not joined, the possibility for inconsistent judgments exists. Judicial resources will be needlessly consumed in relitigation of the same question.</p>
	<p id="c10438cf-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if we were wholly persuaded by these arguments as a matter of policy, acceptance of them would require a rewriting rather than an interpretation of the relevant Rules. But we are not persuaded that their acceptance would lead to a more satisfactory method of handling cases like this one. It must be remembered that the alternatives are a duty to intervene based on knowledge, on the one hand, and some form of joinder, as the Rules presently provide, on the other. No one can seriously contend that an employer might successfully defend against a Title VII claim by one group of employees on the ground that its actions were required by an earlier decree entered in a suit brought against it by another, if the later group did not have adequate notice or knowledge of the earlier suit.</p>
	<p id="c10438d0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The difficulties petitioners foresee in identifying those who could be adversely affected by a decree granting broad remedial relief are undoubtedly present, but they arise from the nature of the relief sought and not because of any choice between mandatory intervention and joinder. Rule 19’s provisions for joining interested parties are designed to accommodate the sort of complexities that may <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="822" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page822">p. 822</span>arise from a decree affecting numerous people in various ways. We doubt that a mandatory intervention rule would be any less awkward. As mentioned, plaintiffs who seek the aid of the courts to alter existing employment policies, or the employer who might be subject to conflicting decrees, are best able to bear the burden of designating those who would be adversely affected if plaintiffs prevail; these parties will generally have a better understanding of the scope of likely relief than employees who are not named but might be affected. Petitioners’ alternative does not eliminate the need for, or difficulty of, identifying persons who, because of their interests, should be included in a lawsuit. It merely shifts that responsibility to less able shoulders.</p>
	<p id="c10438d1-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor do we think that the system of joinder called for by the Rules is likely to produce more relitigation of issues than the converse rule. The breadth of a lawsuit and concomitant relief may be at least partially shaped in advance through Rule 19 to avoid needless clashes with future litigation. And even under a regime of mandatory intervention, parties who did not have adequate knowledge of the suit would relitigate issues. Additional questions about the adequacy and timeliness of knowledge would inevitably crop up. We think that the system of joinder presently contemplated by the Rules best serves the many interests involved in the run of litigated cases, including cases like the present one. . . . </p>

	<p id="c10438d3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a matter of a law there is a vast difference between persons who are actual parties to litigation and persons who merely have the kind of interest that may as a practical matter be impaired by the outcome of a case. Persons in the first category have a right to participate in a trial and to appeal from an adverse judgment; depending on whether they win or lose, their legal rights may be enhanced or impaired. Persons in the latter category have a right to intervene in the action in a timely fashion, or they may be joined as parties against their will. But if they remain on the sidelines, they may be harmed as a practical matter even though their legal rights are unaffected. One of the disadvantages of sideline-sitting is that the bystander has no right to appeal from a judgment no matter how harmful it may be.</p>
	<p id="c10438d4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case the Court quite rightly concludes that the white firefighters who brought the second series of Title VII cases could not be deprived of their legal rights in the first series of cases because they had neither intervened nor been joined as parties. The consent decrees obviously could not deprive them of any contractual rights, such as seniority or accrued vacation pay, or of any other legal rights, such as the right to have their employer comply with federal statutes like Title VII. There is no reason, however, why the consent decrees might not produce changes in conditions at the white firefighters’ place of employment that, as a practical matter, may have a serious effect on their opportunities for employment or promotion even though they are not bound by the decrees in any legal sense. The fact that one of the effects of a decree is to curtail the job opportunities of nonparties does not mean that the nonparties have been deprived of legal rights or that they have standing to appeal from that decree without becoming parties. . . . </p>

The other view, adopted in <i>Wilks</i>, is that those in the suit share with the court the responsibility for joining the absentees. On this view the penalty for failing to locate and join all absentee interests is that one must face the prospect of subsequent litigation when the absentees do assert their interests.

	<p id="c104870a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In discussing necessary parties, we considered briefly a case in which a husband made a life insurance policy payable to “my wife.” Suppose the couple subsequently divorced, Husband remarried and later died. Suppose both wives claim the proceeds of the policy. If they bring separate suits on the policy, it is possible that, to the consternation of the insurance company, both will win. The same situation could occur if a bank held an account of a small business, whose members had a falling out. Suppose two competing claimants appear at the bank, each wanting to withdraw the entire account. In both cases, the “stakeholder"—the insurer or the bank—concedes that it owes the money—but it wants some way to bind everyone to an adjudication of the dispute. The stakeholder wants a procedure that will bind all claimants.</p>
	<p id="c104870b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the past, any possible resolution of the stakeholder’s dilemma had to overcome two difficulties: (1) the unavailability of an effective procedural device to join both claimants, and (2) possible jurisdictional and venue limitations. <i>Interpleader</i> provides a procedure by which a stakeholder—often a bank or insurer—can require the competing claimants to litigate their rights to the fund or property in question. Rule 22 typifies such a joinder provision; note that it allows interpleader even if the stakeholder asserts some claim on the assets itself—as might be the case if a bank wanted to reduce the balance of the account by the amount of an unpaid loan. Typically, the stakeholder invokes interpleader, joining the claimants as parties.</p>
	<p id="c104870c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Such a proceeding will, however, fail to yield a stable resolution of the dispute if the forum lacks jurisdiction over the claimants. As an illustration of the jurisdictional difficulties such limitations could pose, consider New York Life Insurance Co. v. Dunlevy, 241 U.S. 518 (1916). Father, in Pennsylvania, bought an insurance policy that paid a lump sum amount after a set number of years. The sum came due, but Father and Daughter disagreed about whether he or she was entitled to the sum. One of Daughter’s creditors brought suit in Pennsylvania. The insurer, knowing of the dispute between Father and Daughter, interpleaded Father, Daughter, and Creditor. The Pennsylvania court ruled that Father was entitled to the proceeds. Daughter, dissatisfied by this result, sued the insurer in California. Insurer contended that the Pennsylvania suit precluded Daughter’s claim. Wrong, held the U.S. Supreme Court—because Pennsylvania had not acquired personal jurisdiction over Daughter, who lived in California. The insurer was thus liable—a second time—for the policy proceeds.</p>
	<p id="c104870d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress responded to the procedural uncertainties and the jurisdictional issues presented in cases like <i>Dunlevy</i> by enacting the Federal Interpleader Act, codified at 28 U.S.C. §§1335, 1397, and 2361. This legislation accomplishes several tasks:</p>
	<ul class="">
	<li><p id="c104870e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Interpleader Act broadens the circumstances in which interpleader is available, eliminating some restrictions that older equity doctrines had imposed. See §1335.</p></li>
	<li><p id="c104870f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Act removes limitations on federal subject matter jurisdiction. How does it do this? See §1335(a).</p></li>
	<li><p id="c1048710-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="826" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page826">p. 826</span>The Act permits nationwide service of process—a phrase interpreted to mean nationwide personal jurisdiction. See §2361. Thus, in <i>Dunlevy</i>, Daughter would be subject to the jurisdiction of the federal courts in Pennsylvania, which could thus resolve all the parties’ conflicting claims.</p></li>
	<li><p id="c1048711-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Act expands venue provisions to permit venue where any claimant resides. See §1397.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p id="c1048712-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 22 closely resembles the Interpleader Act. But Rule 22 interpleader actions are subject to the normal rules for subject matter jurisdiction (diversity between all plaintiffs and all defendants; amount in controversy); personal jurisdiction (jurisdiction within the state); and venue (residency of all defendants, or where the claim arises). In practice, Rule 22 interpleader is used when the stakeholder is a citizen of one state and all claimants are citizens of a second state. In such a case, there is no jurisdiction under the Interpleader Act because no two claimants are of diverse citizenship. In such cases, however, the normal rules for jurisdiction and venue can be satisfied by an action in the state of all claimants.</p>

	<p id="c104d551-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . In any case in federal court, federal subject matter jurisdiction must be present before the court may properly consider the claim. <i>Cf.</i> Richmond, Fredericksburg &amp; Potomac R. Co. v. United States, 945 F.2d 765, 768 (4th Cir. 1991). Plaintiff initiated this interpleader action in order to fulfill its obligations under the insurance policy insuring the life of Mr. Davis and to be discharged from any future actions involving the policy. The concept of interpleader is that, where two or more persons are engaged in a dispute over some property, and the subject of that dispute is in the hands of a third party who is willing to give up the property, the third person is not obliged to incur the expense and risk of defending the action. Rather, the third party may give up the property and be relieved from further actions concerning the matter, leaving the court to resolve the dispute between the persons claiming an interest in the disputed property.</p>
	<p id="c104d552-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the instant case, the plaintiff is the third party willing to give up the subject of the dispute, namely the $95,000 insurance policy amount. The defendants are those persons with a presumed interest in the property held by the plaintiff. Through this interpleader action, the plaintiff is surrendering the value of the policy to the court in order to be relieved of all its obligations under the policy.</p>
	<p id="c104d553-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="828" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page828">p. 828</span>To determine whether there is jurisdiction, this court must examine the two central interpleader provisions, statutory interpleader, 28 U.S.C. §1335, and rule interpleader, Fed. R. Civ. P. 22. While the concept of interpleader under both statutory and rule interpleader is similar, their jurisdictional differences are significant. “The central distinction between statutory interpleader and rule interpleader is the basis for a federal court’s subject matter jurisdiction under each.”</p>
	<p id="c104fc64-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Statutory interpleader under 28 U.S.C. §1335 confers on federal courts jurisdiction over certain interpleader claims. §1335 declares that “district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action of interpleader,” as long as the amount in controversy equals $500 or more and the <i>claimants</i> are at least minimally diverse. 28 U.S.C. §1335(a). In other words, assuming the requisite jurisdictional amount is met, statutory interpleader still requires that two or more of the adverse claimants to a contested fund be “of diverse citizenship as defined in section 1332 of this title.” 28 U.S.C. §1335(a)(1). In the present case, although the amount in controversy exceeds $500, there is no diversity between the defendant claimants. Therefore, there is no jurisdiction under statutory interpleader.</p>
	<p id="c104fc65-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule interpleader is a procedural device that does not alone confer federal jurisdiction over a claim. An interpleader brought under Rule 22 must fall within one of the general statutory grants of federal jurisdiction. This may include diversity jurisdiction, provided that the complete diversity and amount in controversy requirements are met. In the instant case, the amount in controversy is over $75,000.00, and there is diversity between the plaintiff and the defendants. Because the requirements for general diversity jurisdiction are satisfied, the court has jurisdiction over plaintiff’s interpleader action under Rule 22.</p>

	<p id="c104fc6f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A class action permits, in the words of Rule 23, one or more parties to “sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf” of all those similarly situated. The underlying concept is simple: If many persons find themselves in the same situation, advantages may flow from aggregating their many lawsuits into one. But one side’s advantage may be another’s nightmare as it now faces numerous similarly situated persons rather than a single plaintiff. In practice, the class action has stimulated comments as favorable as “one of the most socially useful remedies in history” and as negative as “legalized blackmail.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10CE4_d5444dc6-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N10CE4_d5444dc6-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*4</a></span> Technically a joinder device, the class action has a potential effect on the judicial system and the substantive law unmatched by other joinder devices discussed in this chapter. The class action repays study: It raises some of the most challenging procedural issues on the current legal scene, and it raises questions that lie close to the heart of civil litigation—the nature of representation and the purpose of a lawsuit.</p>
	<p id="c104fc71-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although one can trace collective litigation into the mists of the common law, the modern class action traces its immediate pedigree only to 1966. See generally Stephen C. Yeazell, From Medieval Group Litigation to the Modern Class Action (Yale Univ. Press 1987). The revision of Rule 23 in that year sparked a new interest in and widespread use of class actions, prompting reaction of the type quoted above. Class actions clearly differ from the normal litigation model in which an individual plaintiff seeks redress from an individual defendant. The difference is not merely quantitative. For reasons that will become clear in the following materials, the ability to aggregate large numbers of litigants tends to shift the focus from the client to the lawyer, from damages to attorneys’ fees, and from litigation to settlement.</p>
	<p id="c104fc72-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The effect of class actions on the substantive law is subtler. It is not that the availability of class actions literally changes the statutes or the content of the case law, but, rather, that rules devised for one-on-one litigation have different effects in the context of mass litigation. As you saw in Chapter 5’s discussion of litigation finance, the legal system makes some claims and defenses uneconomical to bring or defend. If your cell phone carrier overcharges you by $2, you might call or e-mail to complain. But if the carrier does not reverse the charge, few of us would bring a lawsuit: The amount at stake would not begin to justify the expense of a suit. By the same token, if—defying economic rationality—you did sue, the carrier would likely settle; the suit would not be worth defending. Now suppose the carrier made similar overcharges to a million customers. If they could join together in a single lawsuit, the economics of litigation would change dramatically: The suit is worth bringing, and it’s worth defending. Is that a good thing? That question, in <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="830" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page830">p. 830</span>various forms, poses the debate surrounding the class action. When the availability of class actions increases the number of claims that are brought rather than simply facilitating the bringing of large numbers of claims that would have been brought separately, the impact of the underlying substantive law may be greatly heightened. Some have argued that this effect is a regrettable aspect of the Rule. Others have argued that the increased potential for deterring wrongdoers and forcing wider compliance with the law is a powerful argument in favor of the device.</p>
	<p id="c104fc73-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alongside the debate about whether the class action is a good thing stands a second issue—that of legal representation. In most of the litigation you have thus far studied, someone hires a lawyer (or finds one to take the case on a contingent basis). As the lawyer conducts the suit, rules of professional responsibility require her to let her client make major litigation decisions—whether to sue and whether and on what terms to settle being among the most important. In class actions, however, there is no client in the ordinary sense of the word. There is a class of people—say cell phone users from the hypothetical case above—and there are representative parties (a few of those who have been overcharged, who are identified as plaintiffs by name in the complaint). But these representatives have no legal authority to make litigation decisions on behalf of the million members of the class. That means that the class’s lawyer stands in a position of enormous responsibility: She must act in the best interests of the class without being able to discuss the case with them. Increasing that burden is the circumstance that the lawyer will often be negotiating her own fee at the same time that she is negotiating the terms of the settlement on behalf of the class. This very difficult professional situation provides a second focus for the debate over the class action, as you will see.</p>

Both flow from the Due Process Clause. One argument inquires whether a party can be bound by litigation to which he is not a party. The other asks whether due process requires certain procedures within the class action in order for it to be a valid adjudication of the absentees’ rights.</p>

	<p id="c105238a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fundamental to the class action is the idea that a suit, conducted by a representative on behalf of a number of persons who are not formal parties, may nevertheless bind the entire represented class. In that respect it represents a departure from the ordinary proposition that one may be bound only by litigation to which one is a party. One might cite any number of cases for this proposition, including <i>Taylor v. Sturgell</i>, supra page 720, and <i>Martin v. Wilks</i>, supra page 819. The next case works out the conditions under which such a representative may bind those who are not <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="831" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page831">p. 831</span>parties.

When she was eight years old, Hansberry’s family deliberately attempted to move into a restricted neighborhood. Restrictive covenants, in which white property owners agreed not to sell to blacks, created a ghetto known as the “Black Belt” on Chicago’s South Side. Carl Hansberry, with the help of Harry H. Pace, president of the Supreme Liberty Life Insurance Company and several white realtors, secretly bought property at 413 East Sixtieth Street and 6140 South Rhodes Avenue. The Hansberrys moved into the house on Rhodes Avenue in May 1937. The family was threatened by a white mob, which threw a brick through a window, narrowly missing Lorraine. The Supreme Court of Illinois upheld the legality of the restrictive covenant and forced the family to leave the house. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the decision on a legal technicality. The result was the opening of thirty blocks of South Side Chicago to African Americans. . . . </p>

Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1 (1948), holding racially restrictive covenants unenforceable. The Hansberrys, a black family, bought a house in an area of Chicago allegedly covered by a racially restrictive covenant. The covenant said it did not take effect unless signed by owners of 95 percent of the frontage. In fact, the signers represented only 54 percent. Lee brought an action to enjoin breach of the covenant, naming as defendants both the Hansberrys, who had purchased a home allegedly in violation of the covenant, and the people from whom the Hansberrys had bought the property. One of the Hansberrys’ defenses was that the covenant was unenforceable because not enough owners had signed it. Plaintiff countered by referring to <i>Burke v. Kleiman</i>, an earlier suit to enforce the same covenant. In <i>Burke</i>, a property owner “on behalf of herself and other property owners in like situation” sued four named individuals allegedly in violation of the covenant. <i>Burke</i> was litigated in the Illinois courts, where the parties had <i>stipulated</i> (falsely) that the requisite 95 percent had signed, and the earlier court had adopted that stipulation in its findings. <i>Burke</i> upheld the covenant. The Supreme Court of Illinois in the present case determined that <i>Burke</i> had been a class action, that the Hansberrys and their vendors were members of the class of plaintiffs in <i>Burke</i>, and that they were therefore bound by the findings in the previous action even though those findings were factually erroneous.]</p>

In such cases where the interests of those not joined are of the same class as the interests of those who are, and where it is considered that the latter fairly represent the former in the prosecution of the litigation of the issues in which all have a common interest, the court will proceed to a decree. . . . </p>

	<p id="c10571c4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is familiar doctrine of the federal courts that members of a class not present as parties to the litigation may be bound by the judgment where they are in fact adequately represented by parties who are present, or where they actually participate in the conduct of the litigation in which members of the class are present as parties, or where the interest of the members of the class, some of whom are present as parties, <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="834" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page834">p. 834</span>is joint, or where for any other reason the relationship between the parties present and those who are absent is such as legally to entitle the former to stand in judgment for the latter.</p>
	<p id="c10571c5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In all such cases, so far as it can be said that the members of the class who are present are, by generally recognized rules of law, entitled to stand in judgment for those who are not, we may assume for present purposes that such procedure affords a protection to the parties who are represented, though absent, which would satisfy the requirements of due process and full faith and credit. Nor do we find it necessary for the decision of this case to say that, when the only circumstance defining the class is that the determination of the rights of its members turns upon a single issue of fact or law, a state could not constitutionally adopt a procedure whereby some of the members of the class could stand in judgment for all, provided that the procedure were so devised and applied as to insure that those present are of the same class as those absent and that the litigation is so conducted as to insure the full and fair consideration of the common issue. We decide only that the procedure and the course of litigation sustained here by the plea of <i>res judicata</i> do not satisfy these requirements.</p>
	<p id="c10571c6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The restrictive agreement did not purport to create a joint obligation or liability. If valid and effective its promises were the several obligations of the signers and those claiming under them. The promises ran severally to every other signer. It is plain that in such circumstances all those alleged to be bound by the agreement would not constitute a single class in any litigation brought to enforce it. Those who sought to secure its benefits by enforcing it could not be said to be in the same class with or represent those whose interest was in resisting performance, for the agreement by its terms imposes obligations and confers rights on the owner of each plot of land who signs it. If those who thus seek to secure the benefits of the agreement were rightly regarded by the state Supreme Court as constituting a class, it is evident that those signers or their successors who are interested in challenging the validity of the agreement and resisting its performance are not of the same class in the sense that their interests are identical so that any group who had elected to enforce rights conferred by the agreement could be said to be acting in the interest of any others who were free to deny its obligation.</p>
	<p id="c10571c7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because of the dual and potentially conflicting interests of those who are putative parties to the agreement in compelling or resisting its performance, it is impossible to say, solely because they are parties to it, that any two of them are of the same class. Nor without more, and with the due regard for the protection of the rights of absent parties which due process exacts, can some be permitted to stand in judgment for all.</p>
	<p id="c10571c8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is one thing to say that some members of a class may represent other members in a litigation where the sole and common interest of the class in the litigation, is either to assert a common right or to challenge an asserted obligation. It is quite another to hold that all those who are free alternatively either to assert rights or to challenge them are of a single class, so that any group, merely because it is of the class so constituted, may be deemed adequately to represent any others of the class in litigating their interests in either alternative. Such a selection of representatives <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="835" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page835">p. 835</span>for purposes of litigation, whose substantial interests are not necessarily or even probably the same as those whom they are deemed to represent, does not afford that protection to absent parties which due process requires. The doctrine of representation of absent parties in a class suit has not hitherto been thought to go so far. Apart from the opportunities it would afford for the fraudulent and collusive sacrifice of the rights of absent parties, we think that the representation in this case no more satisfies the requirements of due process than a trial by a judicial officer who is in such situation that he may have an interest in the outcome of the litigation in conflict with that of the litigants.</p>
	<p id="c10571c9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiffs in the <i>Burke</i> case sought to compel performance of the agreement in behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated. They did not designate the defendants in the suit as a class or seek any injunction or other relief against others than the named defendants, and the decree which was entered did not purport to bind others. In seeking to enforce the agreement the plaintiffs in that suit were not representing the petitioners here whose substantial interest is in resisting performance. The defendants in the first suit were not treated by the pleadings or decree as representing others or as foreclosing by their defense the rights of others; and, even though nominal defendants, it does not appear that their interest in defeating the contract outweighed their interest in establishing its validity. For a court in this situation to ascribe to either the plaintiffs or defendants the performance of such functions on behalf of petitioners here, is to attribute to them a power that it cannot be said that they had assumed to exercise, and a responsibility which, in view of their dual interests it does not appear that they could rightly discharge.</p>

While regulatory approval was pending, however, Phillips sold the gas at higher prices but paid royalties only on the lower, already-approved prices, releasing the funds accumulated from the increased royalties only when the increase met with regulatory approval.

The notice described the action and informed each class member that he could appear in person or by counsel; otherwise each member would be represented by Shutts and the Andersons, the named plaintiffs. The notices also stated that class members would be included in the class and bound by the judgment unless they “opted out” of the lawsuit by executing and returning a “request for exclusion” that was included with the notice. The final class as certified contained 28,100 members; 3,400 had “opted out” of the class by returning the request for exclusion, and notice could not be delivered to another 1,500 members, who were also excluded. Less than 1,000 of the class members resided in Kansas. Only a minuscule amount, approximately one quarter of one percent, of the gas leases involved in the lawsuit were on Kansas land. [After some procedural skirmishing over the class action issue, the case went to trial. On the merits, the Kansas court held “as a matter of Kansas equity law” that Phillips owed the royalty owners interest and entered judgment for the plaintiff class.]</p>
	<p id="c105e71d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner raised two principal claims in its appeal to the Supreme Court of Kansas. It first asserted that the Kansas trial court did not possess personal jurisdiction over absent plaintiff class members as required by <i>International Shoe Co. v. Washington</i> and similar cases. Related to this first claim was petitioner’s contention that the “opt-out” notice to absent class members, which forced them to return the request for exclusion in order to avoid the suit, was insufficient to bind class members who were not residents of Kansas or who did not possess “minimum contacts” with Kansas. Second, petitioner claimed that Kansas courts could not apply Kansas law to every claim in the dispute. The trial court should have looked to the laws of each State where the leases were located to determine, on the basis of conflict of laws principles, whether interest on the suspended royalties was recoverable, and at what rate. . . . </p>
	<p id="c105e71e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reduced to its essentials, petitioner’s argument is that unless out-of-state plaintiffs affirmatively consent, the Kansas courts may not exert jurisdiction over their claims. Petitioner claims that failure to execute and return the “request for exclusion” provided with the class notice cannot constitute consent of the out-of-state plaintiffs; thus Kansas courts may exercise jurisdiction over these plaintiffs <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="839" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page839">p. 839</span>only if the plaintiffs possess the sufficient “minimum contacts” with Kansas as that term is used in cases involving personal jurisdiction over out-of-state defendants. E.g., <i>International Shoe Co. v. Washington</i>, <i>Shaffer v. Heitner</i>, <i>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson</i>. Since Kansas had no prelitigation contact with many of the plaintiffs and leases involved, petitioner claims that Kansas has exceeded its jurisdictional reach and thereby violated the due process rights of the absent plaintiffs. . . . </p>
	<p id="c105e71f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the cases like <i>Shaffer</i> and <i>Woodson</i> which petitioner relies on for a minimum contacts requirement all dealt with out-of-state defendants or parties in the procedural posture of a defendant, petitioner claims that the same analysis must apply to absent class-action plaintiffs. In this regard petitioner correctly points out that a chose in action is a constitutionally recognized property interest possessed by each of the plaintiffs. <i>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co</i>. An adverse judgment by Kansas courts in this case may extinguish the chose in action forever through <i>res judicata</i>. Such an adverse judgment, petitioner claims, would be every bit as onerous to an absent plaintiff as an adverse judgment on the merits would be to a defendant. Thus, the same due process protections should apply to absent plaintiffs: Kansas should not be able to exert jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’ claims unless the plaintiffs have sufficient minimum contacts with Kansas.</p>
	<p id="c105e720-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think petitioner’s premise is in error. The burdens placed by a State upon an absent class-action plaintiff are not of the same order or magnitude as those it places upon an absent defendant. An out-of-state defendant summoned by a plaintiff is faced with the full powers of the forum State to render judgment <i>against</i> it. The defendant must generally hire counsel and travel to the forum to defend itself from the plaintiff’s claim, or suffer a default judgment. The defendant may be forced to participate in extended and often costly discovery, and will be forced to respond in damages or to comply with some other form of remedy imposed by the court should it lose the suit. The defendant may also face liability for court costs and attorney’s fees. . . . </p>
	<p id="c105e721-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A class-action plaintiff, however, is in quite a different posture. . . . </p>
	<p id="c105e722-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sharp contrast to the predicament of a defendant haled into an out-of-state forum, the plaintiffs in this suit were not haled anywhere to defend themselves upon pain of a default judgment. As commentators have noted, from the plaintiffs’ point of view a class action resembles a “quasi-administrative proceeding, conducted by the judge.” A plaintiff class in Kansas and numerous other jurisdictions cannot first be certified unless the judge, with the aid of the named plaintiffs and defendant, conducts an inquiry into the common nature of the named plaintiffs and the absent plaintiffs’ claims, the adequacy of representation, the jurisdiction possessed over the class, and any other matters that will bear upon proper representation of the absent plaintiffs’ interest. See, e.g., Kan. Stat. Ann. §60-223 (1983), Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23. Unlike a defendant in a civil suit, a class-action plaintiff is not required to fend for himself. See Kan. Stat. Ann. §60-223(d) (1983). The court and named plaintiffs protect his interest. Indeed, the class-action defendant itself has a great interest in ensuring that the absent plaintiffs’ claims are properly before the forum. . . . </p>

Most jurisdictions, including Kansas, require that a class action, once certified, may not be dismissed or compromised without the approval of the court. In many jurisdictions such as Kansas the court may amend the pleadings to ensure that all sections of the class are represented adequately. Kan. Stat. Ann. §60-223(d) (1983); see also e.g., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(d).</p>

At the time of <i>Shutts</i>, Rule 23 was silent about whether any notice was required for (b)(1) and (b)(2) classes. Rule 23(c)(2)(A) now provides that “the court may direct appropriate notice” to (b)(1) and (b)(2) classes. Does <i>Shutts</i> shed any light on when a court should require notice?</p></li>
	<li class=""><p id="c106355a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose that Kansas, instead of excluding the 1,500 royalty owners who could not be located, had included them in the class. Would these unnotified absentees have been bound by the resulting judgment? <i>Shutts</i> suggests not, but recall the facts of <i>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust</i> (Chapter 2). In that case, the Court held that a number of unnotified trust beneficiaries would be bound by a judgment because they had been adequately represented by those who were notified. If <i>Mullane</i> is good law, then notice to those who can’t easily be located is not required. This is how lower courts and commentators have read <i>Shutts</i> and <i>Mullane</i>: So long as notice was reasonably calculated to reach class members, class members who did not actually receive notice of the action are still bound.</p></li>

	<p id="c106355e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Besides its lessons on personal jurisdiction, <i>Shutts</i> touches on two other important features of the modern class action. First, though not all states provide for class actions, many do, and thus state as well as federal courts can entertain class actions—including class actions in which, as in <i>Shutts</i>, most members of the class reside outside the state in question.</p>
	<p id="c106355f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="843" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page843">p. 843</span>Second, in spite of its multistate class membership <i>Shutts</i> was stuck in Kansas courts because of the way in which the Supreme Court had applied its subject matter jurisdiction doctrine to class actions. When a class suit is based on a federal statute, jurisdiction will arise under federal law and §1331 (or some other more specific jurisdiction statute).</p>
	<p id="c1063560-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But what about diversity cases? To take a concrete example, what if <i>Shutts</i> had been filed in a federal court invoking diversity jurisdiction? Or what if Phillips Petroleum had sought to remove the case from Kansas state court to a federal court? Class members were scattered over 50 states, and the defendant, incorporated in Delaware, had its headquarters in Oklahoma. The federal courts have seemed uncertain about how to think about diversity jurisdiction and class actions. Well before the Federal Rules, Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11014_d5444dc6-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" href="#note-N11014_d5444dc6-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*5</a></span> v. Cauble, 255 U.S. 356 (1921), held that for purposes of diversity, courts should look to the citizenship only of the class representatives and ignore the class members. <i>Supreme Tribe</i> thus created an exception to the complete diversity rule for class actions, and to that extent lowered jurisdictional barriers to the multistate diversity-based class action. So far, things would look good for diversity jurisdiction in <i>Shutts.</i></p>
	<p id="c1063562-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Forty years later, as class actions grew in the wake of the 1966 Rules revisions, the Supreme Court had what appeared to be second thoughts. In a pair of cases, it held that both the named plaintiff and each member of the class had to satisfy the amount in controversy requirement. So our hypothetical <i>Shutts</i> diversity action would have been doomed in 1985 because many of those entitled to royalty payments had only small amounts at stake.</p>
	<p id="c1063563-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But two recent developments—one from the courts, the other from Congress—change the picture again. In Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc., 545 U.S. 546 (2005), the Court interpreted the supplemental jurisdiction statute, 28 U.S.C. §1367, to allow such smaller-claims actions under the basic diversity statute, so long as the named party satisfied the amount in controversy requirement. What would this do to our hypothetical <i>Shutts</i> diversity action? The answer is we don’t know; since amount in controversy was not an issue in the Kansas court, the opinions do not tell us whether the named party (or any of the claimants) met the requisite amount; if they had, <i>Shutts</i> would have met the requirements for diversity jurisdiction.</p>
	<p id="c1063564-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the same year <i>Allapattah</i> was decided, Congress entered the scene. Responding to complaints that a few state courts had certified some large class actions of questionable merits—suits that could not be removed to the federal courts because they failed to satisfy the requirements of diversity jurisdiction—Congress enacted the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005. Referred to by lawyers as CAFA, the Act is codified in a new Chapter 114 of 28 U.S.C., in amendments to 28 U.S.C. §1332, and in a new removal provision 28 U.S.C. §1453.</p>
	<p id="c1063565-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="844" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page844">p. 844</span>The Act makes broad use of the principle that Article III requires only minimal diversity. It grants original jurisdiction to the federal courts in class actions in which “any member of the class of plaintiffs” possesses the requisite diversity with respect to “any defendant.” This invocation of bare diversity is coupled with the ability to aggregate claims of all class members to reach the $5 million amount in controversy requirement. 28 U.S.C. §1332(d)(2). Such suits may be brought under original jurisdiction or, under the provisions of §1453, may be removed by “any defendant,” whether or not a citizen of the state in which the action arose.</p>
	<p id="c1065c76-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These provisions use diversity jurisdiction to “federalize” many class actions previously within the exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts. Displaying some uncertainty about how far this federalization should go, the Act both allows and commands federal courts to remand actions in which state interests seem to predominate. It does so by providing that a federal court whose jurisdiction is thus invoked “may. . . . decline” to exercise it under some circumstances and “shall. . . . decline” to exercise it in others. Section 1332(d)(3) defines the factors relevant to the discretionary power to decline federal jurisdiction. Those factors include the relative size of the in-state and out-of-state class membership, “whether the claims asserted involve matters of national or interstate interest,” which state’s law will apply to the claims, and the connection of the forum to the class members, the harm, and the defendant. 28 U.S.C. §1332(d)(3). Recall that these factors bear not on certification but on federal diversity jurisdiction.</p>
	<p id="c1065c77-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 1332(d)(4) delineates the circumstances in which a federal court must decline jurisdiction: if two-thirds or more of the members of the proposed plaintiff class are citizens of the state in which the action was brought and either (1) the primary defendants are also citizens of that state or (2) at least one defendant is a citizen of that state and the principal injuries also occurred there.</p>
	<p id="c1065c78-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The next case illustrates an effort by a litigant who wished to remain in state court to evade the grasp of CAFA; in the process it lays bare some fundamental features of representative litigation.</p>

	<p id="c1068397-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our view, it does not. Our reason is a simple one: Stipulations must be binding. See 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence §2588, p. 821 (J. Chadbourn rev. 1981) (defining a “judicial admission or stipulation” as an “express waiver made. . . . by the party or his attorney conceding for the purposes of the trial the truth of some alleged fact” (emphasis deleted)); 9 Wigmore, <i>supra</i>, §2590<i>,</i> at 822 (the “vital feature” of a judicial admission is “universally conceded to be its <i>conclusiveness</i> upon the party making it”). The stipulation Knowles proffered to the District Court, however, does not speak for those he purports to represent.</p>
	<p id="c1068398-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That is because a plaintiff who files a proposed class action cannot legally bind members of the proposed class before the class is certified. Because his precertification stipulation does not bind anyone but himself, Knowles has not reduced the value of the putative class members’ claims. For jurisdictional purposes, our inquiry is limited to examining the case “as of the time it was filed in state court.” At that point, Knowles lacked the authority to concede the amount-in-controversy issue for the absent class members. The Federal District Court, therefore, wrongly concluded that Knowles’ precertification stipulation could overcome its finding that the CAFA jurisdictional threshold had been met.</p>

Yet the two legal principles to which we have just referred—that stipulations must be binding and that a named plaintiff cannot bind precertification class members—mean that the amount to which Knowles has stipulated is in effect contingent.</p>
	<p id="c106839a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If, for example, as Knowles’ complaint asserts, “hundreds, and possibly thousands” of persons in Arkansas have similar claims, and if each of those claims places a significant sum in controversy, the state court might certify the class and permit the case to proceed, but only on the condition that the stipulation be excised. Or a court might find that Knowles is an inadequate representative due to the artificial cap he purports to impose on the class’ recovery. . . . Even were these possibilities remote in Knowles’ own case, there is no reason to think them farfetched in other cases where similar stipulations could have more dramatic amount-lowering effects. . . . </p>
	<p id="c106839b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The strongest counterargument, we believe, takes a syllogistic form: First, <i>this</i> complaint contains a presently nonbinding stipulation that the class will seek damages that amount to less than $5 million. Second, if the state court eventually certifies that class, the stipulation will bind those who choose to remain as class members. Third, if the state court eventually insists upon modification of the stipulation (thereby permitting class members to obtain more than $5 million), it will have in effect created a new, <i>different</i> case. Fourth, CAFA, however, permits the federal court to consider only the complaint that the plaintiff has filed, <i>i.e., this</i> complaint, not a new, modified (or amended) complaint that might eventually emerge.</p>
	<p id="c106839c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our problem with this argument lies in its conclusion. We do not agree that CAFA forbids the federal court to consider, for purposes of determining the amount in controversy, the very real possibility that a nonbinding, amount-limiting, stipulation may not survive the class certification process. This potential outcome does not result in the creation of a new case not now before the federal court. To hold otherwise would, for CAFA jurisdictional purposes, treat a nonbinding stipulation as if it were binding, exalt form over substance, and run directly counter to CAFA’s primary objective: ensuring “Federal court consideration of interstate cases of national importance.” It would also have the effect of allowing the subdivision of a $100 million action into 21 just-below-$5-million state-court actions simply by including nonbinding stipulations; such an outcome would squarely conflict with the statute’s objective. . . . </p>
	<p id="c106839d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Knowles also points out that federal courts permit individual plaintiffs, who are the masters of their complaints, to avoid removal to federal court, and to obtain a remand to state court, by stipulating to amounts at issue that fall below the federal jurisdictional requirement. That is so. But the key characteristic about those stipulations is that they are legally binding on all plaintiffs. That essential feature is missing here, as Knowles cannot yet bind the absent class. . . . </p>
	<p id="c106839e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, the stipulation at issue here can tie Knowles’ hands, but it does not resolve the amount-in-controversy question in light of his inability to bind the rest of the class. For this reason, we believe the District Court, when following the statute to aggregate the proposed class members’ claims, should have ignored that stipulation. <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="847" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page847">p. 847</span>Because it did not, we vacate the judgment below and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

You may recall from Chapter 3 that Congress has passed legislation dealing with similar efforts by parties to manipulate the amount in controversy in non-class litigation. See, for example, the provisions of 28 U.S.C. §1446(c), permitting a court considering a removal petition to hold a hearing to decide whether the amount in controversy in fact exceeds the statutory limit.</p></li>
	<li><p id="c106a9b3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the case gets its bite from the circumstances that (a) the class has not been certified, and (b) if the stipulation is allowed to stand Knowles might become an inadequate representative of the class.

	<p id="c106a9b6-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As in other settings, both lawyers are using procedural rules for strategic and tactical reasons. We don’t know why Knowles believed that an Arkansas state court would be more hospitable to his claim than a federal court sitting in Arkansas, but he must have strongly so believed—so much that he was willing to leave money on the table by his stipulation (although perhaps he was willing just to leave other class members’ money on the table—thus the Court’s concern about his ability to adequately represent the interests of those class members). Similarly, we don’t know why Standard Fire Insurance’s lawyers felt strongly enough about litigating in the federal system that they were prepared to spend many tens of thousands of dollars appealing the district judge’s remand ruling. As with many other jurisdictional battles lawyers often have strong intuitions about which forum will be more hospitable to their claims or defenses. Those intuitions can be based on factors ranging from guesses about how a state’s highest court will view their case—if it gets that far—to knowledge about the predilections of the state judiciary (or perhaps even a single state or federal judge) to thoughts about the demography of a prospective jury. In jurisdictional cases, these intuitions rarely get articulated in an opinion, but you can be sure that the lawyers on both sides have thought about them.</p>

	<li class=""><p id="c1071ef8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For several years class actions based on alleged violations of federal securities laws have proved controversial. In 1995 Congress, believing that some of these suits lacked merit, acted to tighten pleading requirements for claims alleging violations of federal securities laws. 15 U.S.C. §78u4(b)(1)(B).</p></li>
	<li class=""><p id="c1071ef9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Three years later, citing evidence that plaintiffs had reacted to this change by alleging violations not of federal but of state securities laws and bringing their suits in state courts, Congress enacted the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998, 15 U.S.C. §77p(c). That Act uses an interesting repertory of procedural devices to restrict state law securities class actions. First, it states that federal law preempts state securities laws, but only in class actions alleging fraud in the purchase and sale of securities. Second, it provides that all class actions filed in state courts and alleging securities fraud shall be removable to federal district courts without regard to diversity or amount in controversy. Then, the Act requires the dismissal of the removed claims, unless they fall into a narrow range of permitted claims. The result of this two-step procedure—removal followed by dismissal—essentially eliminates all class actions based on violations of state securities laws.</p></li>
	<li class=""><p id="c1071efa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The student of procedure will find several features of the statute remarkable. Congress undoubtedly has the power to preempt state securities laws. Here, however, Congress has achieved both more and less than preemption. The Act achieves less than preemption because it applies only to class actions rather than to all state law securities claims. It achieves more than ordinary preemption because it assures that all preempted claims will be dismissed. With ordinary substantive preemption, Congress relies on state courts to recognize and enforce the preemptive effect of federal law. The Supreme Court acts as the only federal enforcer of preemptive federal law by granting certiorari if state courts fail to recognize federal preemption. But the Supreme Court can hear only about 100 cases a year and thus allows for considerable slippage in the enforcement of preemptive federal laws. In the Act’s scheme, removal solves this slippage problem. The federal district courts, not the Supreme Court, enforce federal preemption. Every class action involving state securities laws is removable, thus assuring a federal forum for this federal defense. The Act demonstrates both the significance of the class action and the use of federal jurisdiction to control it.</p></li>

Together, they funnel selected categories of civil suits from state to federal courts. Both involve areas where Congress might legislate substantively under its Commerce Clause and related powers. But Congress has not, relying instead on the federal courts to achieve congressional aims. This use of federal judicial power is particularly interesting because, by statutory definition, it applies only to cases involving substantial numbers of people—at least enough to constitute a class.</p></li>

Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust,</i> supra page 276) gave the class action a constitutional basis. <i>Shutts</i> helped sort out additional issues of due process, and the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, interpreted in cases like <i>Knowles</i>, extended diversity jurisdiction to many class actions that, like <i>Shutts</i>, would otherwise have fallen under state jurisdiction. But none of these decisions explains the level of debate surrounding the class action.</p>
	<p id="c1071eff-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Major businesses and other institutions will tell you that they see the class action as a dreadful scourge, forcing them to settle even unjustified suits. With equal fervor the plaintiffs’ bar and public interest groups say that the class action has proved to be a major force for good, achieving institutional reform and requiring powerful institutions to comply with the law. One can find evidence supporting both points of view. This debate has been occurring sporadically since the 1966 revisions to Rule 23 created the modern class action and has occasionally led to such dueling characterizations of the device as those quoted in the introduction to this section: “legalized blackmail” and “one of the most socially useful remedies in history.”</p>
	<p id="c1071f00-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To understand this debate, one has to see how the 1966 revisions to Rule 23 opened new possibilities for the class action. Courts have for the past 50 years been working out those possibilities—and their limits. The starting point is, as always, the text of the Rule. That text establishes a series of hurdles for class actions to surmount on their way to “certification,” a process described in Rule 23(c). To become certified, a class action must meet both the requirements of Rule 23(a) and also fit into one of the three categories of Rule 23(b).</p>
	<p id="c1071f01-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Practitioners refer to the four requirements of Rule 23(a) as numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation. To establish a case as a class action, the person seeking to represent the class must show that each of these requirements is satisfied.</p>
	<ul class="">
	<li><p id="c1071f02-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Numerosity (Rule 23(a)(1)) is established if the class representative can show that enough persons are in the class to make joining them as individuals impractical. Courts occasionally certify classes as small as a few score, but typically classes consist of at least hundreds of persons.</p></li>
	<li><p id="c1071f03-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Commonality (Rule 23(a)(2)) captures the idea that the class should be a class—that it should consist of persons who share characteristics that matter <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="851" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page851">p. 851</span>in terms of the substantive law involved. We have already encountered this idea in <i>Mosley v. General Motors</i>, supra page 788. <i>Mosley</i> discussed commonality as a requirement for joining individual plaintiffs under Rule 20. A similar requirement of cohesiveness recurs in class actions. For example, a “class” consisting of all persons who have claims against the United States would not have much in common: One person would be seeking an income tax refund, another compensation for an accident involving a postal truck, and a third might be seeking Social Security benefits. A much-litigated question is whether the members of the class have <i>enough</i> in common to justify class certification. Since virtually all classes proposed will have some characteristics in common and some unshared characteristics, there is much room for argument. This requirement is one focus of <i>Wal-Mart v. Dukes</i>, infra page 855.</p></li>
	<li><p id="c1074614-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Typicality (Rule 23(a)(3)) is the requirement that class representatives stand, in significant respects, in the same shoes as the average class member. For example, in a case alleging mismanagement of a pension plan, if most members of the class have lost a few hundred dollars, it would raise a typicality problem if the class representative alleged losses of tens of thousands—or vice versa. The premise underlying the typicality requirement is that the class’s lawyers will be making litigation decisions with the representative in mind. In order to protect the interests of the absent class members, one would want the representative clients to have the same incentives and motivations as the average class members. In practice, the class representatives have proved far less significant than the lawyers, and judges have consequently been willing to bend the requirements of typicality if they are assured that the last requirement—adequacy of representation—is fulfilled.</p></li>
	<li><p id="c1074615-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Adequacy (Rule 23(a)(4)) has two dimensions. One focuses on the class representatives, the other on the class’s prospective lawyer. Let us start with the representatives. To take an obvious point, a class representative should not be an employee or a relative of the lawyer—relationships that would conflict with the representative’s decisions about the litigation. Class representatives have been found inadequate because their real reason for pursuing the class action was to gain leverage for their own case. Still other class representatives have been found inadequate for reasons like those in <i>Hansberry</i>: Their interests conflicted in some way with those of some or all of the class members. In <i>Hansberry,</i> you will recall the problem was that the class in which Hansberry was supposed to be included consisted of people trying to enforce the racially restrictive covenant that Hansberry was attacking. But more subtle conflicts can also doom a representative. Consider <i>Knowles</i>, supra page 844, where the court rejected Knowles’s stipulation concerning damages because it might have put him at odds with class members if it appeared that the insurer’s payment policies had damaged the class members by <i>more</i> than $5 million.</p>
	<p id="c1074616-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second branch of the “adequacy” determination requires courts to focus on the class’s lawyer—recognizing that the lawyer will be making many of the most significant decisions. Rule 23(g) enumerates factors a court should <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="852" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page852">p. 852</span>consider in selecting class counsel. The lawyer should have no conflicts that would cloud the representation. The lawyer has to be sufficiently skillful and equipped with sufficient support and resources to handle the case. To use an extreme example, it is unlikely that a young lawyer with the ink still drying on her bar certificate would be found to be an adequate representative in a complex class action. Conversely, courts finding adequacy typically recite the lawyer’s experience with previous similar cases. Decisions also note the lawyer’s and firm’s ability to finance protracted litigation—many class actions will be long and expensive. Looking in a different direction, Rule 23(g)(1)(A)(i) tells the court to consider “work [prospective] counsel has done in identifying or investigating potential claims in the action"—thus crediting the entrepreneurial activity of counsel. Rule 23(g) also empowers the court to ask prospective counsel what fees it might eventually ask for—because in most class actions the court must approve lawyers’ fees.</p>

	</ul>
	<p id="c1074617-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although Rule 23(a) does not list it, some circuits have additionally required plaintiffs demonstrate the ascertainability of the class. The Third Circuit has the most demanding test, requiring plaintiffs to show that “(1) the class is defined with reference to objective criteria; and (2) there is a reliable and administratively feasible mechanism for determining whether putative class members fall within the class definition.” Byrd v. Aaron’s Inc. 784 F.3d 154, 163 (3d Cir. 2015). Other circuits have rejected a heightened precertification ascertainability requirement, finding it incompatible with the language of Rule 23. See Briseno v. ConAgra Foods Inc., 844 F.3d 1121 (9th Cir. 2017).</p>
	<p id="c1074618-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having surmounted the hurdles of Rule 23(a), the lawyer seeking class certification still has to show that the litigation fits within one of the three categories of Rule 23(b). One might ask why: If the case fits the requirements of Rule 23(a), should it not be a class action? The answer lies in the law’s uncertainty about the goals of the class action. The drafters of the Rule were understandably unsure about the potential of the class action—for good or for ill. They had two fairly clear cases in mind that they thought should usually be treated as class actions—the situations described in Rule 23(b)(1) and 23(b)(2)—and a residual category—the (b)(3) cases—where they wanted courts to proceed cautiously.</p>
	<p id="c1074619-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first situation—the 23(b)(1) class—is essentially a mass-production version of Rule 19. For example, suppose a city proposes to issue bonds to build a new civic auditorium. One group of citizens sues to block the issuance of the bonds; another group sues the city to insist that it go forward with the bonds and the project. If those suits proceed separately, the city might find itself the subject of incompatible judicial rulings: Issue the bonds; do not issue the bonds. By grouping the challengers and the supporters into classes, the court prevents a situation in which “varying adjudications with respect to individual class members” (the taxpayers) “would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class” (the city). Or, to take another example, suppose that a number of claimants all seek to collect on claims that exceed insurance coverage. Under such circumstances, Rule 23(b)(1) provides a way to assure that similarly situated parties are treated alike.</p>
	<p id="c107461a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 23(b)(2) provides for class actions where the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act “on grounds that apply generally to the class.” The <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="853" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page853">p. 853</span>Advisory Committee notes to the Rule make clear that the drafters had in mind civil rights claims, although the notes reflect that subdivision (b)(2) is not limited to such claims. Courts have glossed Rule 23(b)(2) by limiting it to cases in which the plaintiffs are primarily seeking injunctive or declaratory relief. Again, such a description fits the standard civil rights case, where the typical relief sought is an injunction requiring some action—voter registration, school integration, changes in employment practices—by a defendant. An often litigated question is how much incidental monetary relief a Rule 23(b)(2) class can seek before the action ceases to be primarily injunctive and therefore ineligible for Rule 23(b)(2) treatment; you will see that issue coming to the surface in <i>Wal-Mart v. Dukes</i>, the next case.</p>
	<p id="c107461b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The final category of class actions—those brought under Rule 23(b)(3)—has pro­ved the most controversial. It comprises all class actions not captured in Rules 23(b)(1) and 23(b)(2). In particular, it includes all claims in which the plaintiffs are seeking primarily money damages. Rule 23(b)(3) provides that a court can certify such a class only if it meets two criteria in addition to those in 23(a): that the issues common to the class members “predominate” over those affecting only individual class members; and that a class action is “superior” to any other method for “fairly and efficiently” adjudicating the controversy. Rule 23(b)(3) also sets forth factors a court should consider in certifying a (b)(3) class, one of which is the “likely difficulties in managing a class action.” That last factor can be important; class actions typically require active court management and can consume substantial amounts of judicial time.</p>
	<p id="c107461c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In practice, (b)(3) actions can be subdivided into two groups. One group consists of what one might call “small claims” lawsuits: actions in which many persons allege small amounts of damage. Examples include the hypothetical cell phone overcharge described earlier in this section. Typically, such claims are not worth any individual plaintiff’s time or money to bring and only the class action device makes them viable. Because of this feature, lawyers sometimes refer to this group of class actions as “negative value” cases—meaning that to pursue claims on an individual basis would cost more than the case could yield. As a result, in such actions the defendant is, as a practical matter, immune from liability unless a class is certified.</p>
	<p id="c107461d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the other end of the scale of Rule 23(b)(3) actions lies what is often called the “mass tort"—an airplane crash, a hotel fire, the exposure of hundreds of thousands of workers to asbestos. Notice that, unlike the negative value cases, each individual claim has substantial damages attached to it. The drafters of Rule 23 suggested in the Advisory Committee notes that such cases would not usually be appropriate for class treatment, but in recent decades courts have increasingly—and controversially—certified class actions in mass torts. In these suits, the incentives for a class action change. To plaintiffs, they continue to offer the increased bargaining power that comes from aggregation and the prospect of a single overwhelming damage judgment. In contrast to the small claims cases, they also offer some advantages to defendants—consolidation (of suits that would have been brought even without the class action), efficiency, and the possibility of a global settlement.</p>
	<p id="c107461e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Placing a class action in one of the Rule 23 categories is more than a matter of analytical neatness. Whole cases may stand or fall as a result of the classification. This unexpected consequence flows from two sources. First, Rule 23(b)(3) requires the certifying judge to engage in a complicated weighing of advantages <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="854" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page854">p. 854</span>and disadvantages, unnecessary for (b)(1) and (b)(2) classes—as a result of which he may rule against certification.</p>
	<p id="c107461f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, Rule 23(c)(2)(B) requires individual notice to all members of Rule 23(b)(3) classes who can be identified through reasonable effort; by contrast, Rule 23(c)(2)(A) allows, but does not require, “appropriate notice” to the class in 23(b)(1) and (b)(2) cases. Because the Supreme Court has held that the representative plaintiff must initially pay for such notice, inability to bear these costs may end the suit. Eisen v. Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156 (1974). There is a third significant difference between the class types: Members of a Rule 23(b)(3) class, when notified of the action, must also be given an opportunity to opt out of the class. Rule 23(b)(3) class members may get another opportunity to opt out when the case is settled. Members of (b)(1) and (b)(2) classes, in contrast, are unable to opt out.</p>

	<li class=""><p id="c1076d3c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In litigation, as with so much else in life, those with more economic and social power are at an advantage. Procedural rules have the potential to shift those power relations in dramatic ways. The class action puts the power-shifting potential of procedure into sharp relief. In a case brought by an individual consumer against a large public or private institution, the institution will often have the upper hand. But in a case brought by a class of thousands of consumers, financed by a group of plaintiffs’ attorneys, the economic and social dynamics shift. Business groups argue that this financial shift causes plaintiff classes to seek “blackmail settlements” for meritless claims. Certification requirements, particularly those in Rule 23(b)(3), limit the kinds of disputes that can be certified as class actions, and thereby limit the reach of class actions’ power-shifting potential.</p></li>
	<li class=""><p id="c1076d3d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Class action rules also aim to guide the complex relationship between a lawyer and a class. When a lawyer represents a single client, communication, consultation, and lines of authority are generally well established. In a class action, each of these areas becomes more difficult to maneuver. Rules governing commonality and adequacy at the class certification stage, and notice at multiple stages of the litigation process, aim to address some of these problems of legal representation endemic to the class action.</p></li>

	<p id="c1079457-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner Wal-Mart is the Nation’s largest private employer. It operates four types of retail stores throughout the country: Discount Stores, Supercenters, Neighborhood Markets, and Sam’s Clubs. Those stores are divided into seven nationwide divisions, which in turn comprise 41 regions of 80 to 85 stores apiece. Each store has between 40 and 53 separate departments and 80 to 500 staff positions. In all, Wal-Mart operates approximately 3,400 stores and employs more than one million people.</p>
	<p id="c1079458-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Pay and promotion decisions at Wal-Mart are generally committed to local managers’ broad discretion, which is exercised “in a largely subjective manner.” Local store managers may increase the wages of hourly employees (within limits) with only limited corporate oversight. As for salaried employees, such as store managers and their deputies, higher corporate authorities have discretion to set their pay within preestablished ranges.</p>
	<p id="c1079459-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Promotions work in a similar fashion. Wal-Mart permits store managers to apply their own subjective criteria when selecting candidates as “support managers,” which is the first step on the path to management. Admission to Wal-Mart’s management training program, however, does require that a candidate meet certain objective criteria, including an above-average performance rating, at least one year’s tenure in the applicant’s current position, and a willingness to relocate. But except for those requirements, regional and district managers have discretion to use their own judgment when selecting candidates for management training. Promotion to higher office—<i>e.g.</i>, assistant manager, co-manager, or store manager—is similarly at the discretion of the employee’s superiors after prescribed objective factors are satisfied.</p>

	<p id="c107945c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These plaintiffs, respondents here, do not allege that Wal-Mart has any express corporate policy against the advancement of women.

And, respondents say, because Wal-Mart is aware of this effect, its refusal to cabin its managers’ authority amounts to disparate treatment. Their complaint seeks injunctive and declaratory relief, punitive damages, and backpay. It does not ask for compensatory damages.</p>
	<p id="c107bb6d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Importantly for our purposes, respondents claim that the discrimination to which they have been subjected is common to <i>all</i> Wal-Mart’s female employees. The basic theory of their case is that a strong and uniform “corporate culture” permits bias against women to infect, perhaps subconsciously, the discretionary decisionmaking of each one of Wal-Mart’s thousands of managers—thereby making every woman at the company the victim of one common discriminatory practice. Respondents therefore wish to litigate the Title VII claims of all female employees at Wal-Mart’s stores in a nationwide class action.</p>

	<p id="c107bb72-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Wal-Mart unsuccessfully moved to strike much of this evidence. It also offered its own countervailing statistical and other proof in an effort to defeat Rule 23(a)’s requirements of commonality, typicality, and adequate representation. Wal-Mart further contended that respondents’ monetary claims for backpay could not be certified under Rule 23(b)(2), first because that Rule refers only to injunctive and declaratory relief, and second because the backpay claims could not be manageably tried as a class without depriving Wal-Mart of its right to present certain statutory defenses. With one limitation not relevant here, the District Court granted respondents’ motion and certified their proposed class. [Invoking Rule 23(f), which permits a Court of Appeals to accept an appeal from an order “granting or denying class-action certification,” Wal-Mart appealed.]</p>

L. Rev. 97, 131-132 (2009). For example: Do all of us plaintiffs indeed work for Wal-Mart? Do our managers have discretion over pay? Is that an unlawful employment practice? What remedies should we get? Reciting these questions is not sufficient to obtain class certification. Commonality requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that the class members “have suffered the same injury.” This does not mean merely that they have all suffered a violation of the same provision of law. Title VII, for example, can be violated in many ways—by intentional discrimination, or by <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="859" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page859">p. 859</span>hiring and promotion criteria that result in disparate impact, and by the use of these practices on the part of many different superiors in a single company. Quite obviously, the mere claim by employees of the same company that they have suffered a Title VII injury, or even a disparate-impact Title VII injury, gives no cause to believe that all their claims can productively be litigated at once. Their claims must depend upon a common contention—for example, the assertion of discriminatory bias on the part of the same supervisor. That common contention, moreover, must be of such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution—which means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.</p>

	<p id="c107e294-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Falcon</i> suggested two ways in which that conceptual gap might be bridged. First, if the employer “used a biased testing procedure to evaluate both applicants for employment and incumbent employees, a class action on behalf of every applicant or employee who might have been prejudiced by the test clearly would satisfy the commonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a).” Second, “[s]ignificant proof that an employer operated under a general policy of discrimination conceivably could justify a class of both applicants and employees if the discrimination manifested itself in hiring and promotion practices in the same general fashion, such as through entirely subjective decisionmaking processes.” We think that statement precisely describes respondents’ burden in this case. The first manner of bridging the gap obviously has no application here; Wal-Mart has no testing procedure or other company-wide evaluation method that can be charged with bias. The whole point of permitting discretionary decisionmaking is to avoid evaluating employees under a common standard.</p>
	<p id="c107e295-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second manner of bridging the gap requires “significant proof” that Wal-Mart “operated under a general policy of discrimination.” That is entirely absent here. Wal-Mart’s announced policy forbids sex discrimination, and as the District Court recognized the company imposes penalties for denials of equal employment opportunity. The only evidence of a “general policy of discrimination” respondents produced was the testimony of Dr. William Bielby, their sociological expert. Relying on “social framework” analysis, Bielby testified that Wal-Mart has a “strong corporate culture,” that makes it “’vulnerable’” to “gender bias.” He could not, however, “determine with any specificity how regularly stereotypes play a meaningful role in employment decisions at Wal-Mart. At his deposition. . . . Dr. Bielby conceded that he could not calculate whether 0.5 percent or 95 percent of the employment decisions at Wal-Mart might be determined by stereotyped thinking. . . . Bielby[’s testimony] is worlds away from “significant proof” that Wal-Mart “operated under a general policy of discrimination.”</p>

	<p id="c10809a8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To be sure, we have recognized that, “in appropriate cases,” giving discretion to lower-level supervisors can be the basis of Title VII liability under a disparate-impact theory—since “an employer’s undisciplined system of subjective decisionmaking [can have] precisely the same effects as a system pervaded by impermissible intentional discrimination.” But the recognition that this type of Title VII claim “can” exist does not lead to the conclusion that every employee in a company using a system of discretion has such a claim in common. . . . </p>
	<p id="c10809a9-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents have not identified a common mode of exercising discretion that pervades the entire company—aside from their reliance on Dr. Bielby’s social frameworks analysis that we have rejected. In a company of Wal-Mart’s size and geographical scope, it is quite unbelievable that all managers would exercise their discretion in a common way without some common direction. Respondents attempt to make that showing by means of statistical and anecdotal evidence, but their evidence falls well short.</p>
	<p id="c10809aa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statistical evidence consists primarily of regression analyses performed by Dr. Richard Drogin, a statistician, and Dr. Marc Bendick, a labor economist. After considering regional and national data, Drogin concluded that “there are statistically significant disparities between men and women at Wal-Mart. . . . [and] these disparities. . . . can be explained only by gender discrimination.” Bendick compared work-force data from Wal-Mart and competitive retailers and concluded that Wal-Mart “promotes a lower percentage of women than its competitors.”</p>
	<p id="c10809ab-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if they are taken at face value, these studies are insufficient to establish that respondents’ theory can be proved on a classwide basis. . . . As Judge Ikuta observed in her dissent, “[i]nformation about disparities at the regional and national level does not establish the existence of disparities at individual stores, let alone raise the inference that a companywide policy of discrimination is implemented by discretionary decisions at the store and district level.” A regional pay disparity, for example, may be attributable to only a small set of Wal-Mart stores, and cannot by itself establish the uniform, store-by-store disparity upon which the plaintiffs’ theory of commonality depends. . . . [For these and other reasons, the Court found this expert testimony insufficient to suggest a common practice.]</p>
	<p id="c10809ac-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents’ anecdotal evidence suffers from the same defects, and in addition is too weak to raise any inference that all the individual, discretionary personnel decisions are discriminatory. . . . Here. . . . respondents filed some 120 affidavits reporting experiences of discrimination—about 1 for every 12,500 class members—relating to only some 235 out of Wal-Mart’s 3,400 stores. . . . Even if every single one of these accounts is true, that would not demonstrate that the entire company “operate[s] under a general policy of discrimination.”  . . . </p>

	<p id="c10809b0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We also conclude that respondents’ claims for backpay were improperly certified under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2). Our opinion in Ticor Title Ins. Co. v. Brown, 511 U.S. 117, 121 (1994) (<i>per curiam</i>) expressed serious doubt about whether claims for monetary relief may be certified under that provision. We now hold that they may not, at least where (as here) the monetary relief is not incidental to the injunctive or declaratory relief.</p>
	<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead">

	<p id="c10809b2-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rule 23(b)(2) allows class treatment when “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.” One possible reading of this provision is that it applies <i>only</i> to requests for such injunctive or declaratory relief and does not authorize the class certification of monetary claims at all. We need not reach that broader question in this case, because we think that, at a minimum, claims for <i>individualized</i> relief (like the backpay at issue here) do not satisfy the Rule. The key to the (b)(2) class is “the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted—the notion that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of them.” Nagareda, 84 N.Y.U. L. Rev. at 132. In other words, Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single injunction or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the class. It does not authorize class certification when each individual class member would be entitled to a <i>different</i> injunction or declaratory judgment against the defendant. Similarly, it does not authorize class certification when each class member would be entitled to an individualized award of monetary damages.</p>
	<p id="c10809b3-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That interpretation accords with the history of the Rule. Because Rule 23 “stems from equity practice” that predated its codification, in determining its meaning we have previously looked to the historical models on which the Rule was based. As we observed in <i>Amchem</i>, “[c]ivil rights cases against parties charged with unlawful, class-based discrimination are prime examples” of what (b)(2) is meant to capture. In particular, the Rule reflects a series of decisions involving challenges to racial segregation—conduct that was remedied by a single classwide order. In none of the cases cited by the Advisory Committee as examples of (b)(2)’s antecedents did the plaintiffs combine any claim for individualized relief with their classwide injunction.</p>
	<p id="c10830c4-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Permitting the combination of individualized and classwide relief in a (b)(2) class is also inconsistent with the structure of Rule 23(b). Classes certified under (b)(1) <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="863" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page863">p. 863</span>and (b)(2) share the most traditional justifications for class treatment—that individual adjudications would be impossible or unworkable, as in a (b)(1) class, or that the relief sought must perforce affect the entire class at once, as in a (b)(2) class. For that reason these are also mandatory classes: The Rule provides no opportunity for (b)(1) or (b)(2) class members to opt out, and does not even oblige the District Court to afford them notice of the action. Rule 23(b)(3), by contrast, is an “adventuresome innovation” of the 1966 amendments, framed for situations “in which ‘class-action treatment is not as clearly called for’” (quoting Advisory Committee’s Notes, 28 U.S.C. App., p. 697 (1994 ed.)). It allows class certification in a much wider set of circumstances but with greater procedural protections. Its only prerequisites are that “the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.” Rule 23(b)(3). And unlike (b)(1) and (b)(2) classes, the (b)(3) class is not mandatory; class members are entitled to receive “the best notice that is practicable under the circumstances” and to withdraw from the class at their option. See Rule 23(c)(2)(B).</p>
	<p id="c10830c5-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given that structure, we think it clear that individualized monetary claims belong in Rule 23(b)(3). The procedural protections attending the (b)(3) class—predominance, superiority, mandatory notice, and the right to opt out—are missing from (b)(2) not because the Rule considers them unnecessary, but because it considers them unnecessary <i>to a (b)(2) class</i>. When a class seeks an indivisible injunction benefitting all its members at once, there is no reason to undertake a case-specific inquiry into whether class issues predominate or whether class action is a superior method of adjudicating the dispute. Predominance and superiority are self-evident. But with respect to each class member’s individualized claim for money, that is not so—which is precisely why (b)(3) requires the judge to make findings about predominance and superiority before allowing the class. Similarly, (b)(2) does not require that class members be given notice and opt-out rights, presumably because it is thought (rightly or wrongly) that notice has no purpose when the class is mandatory, and that depriving people of their right to sue in this manner complies with the Due Process Clause. In the context of a class action predominantly for money damages we have held that absence of notice and opt-out violates due process. While we have never held that to be so where the monetary claims do not predominate, the serious possibility that it may be so provides an additional reason not to read Rule 23(b)(2) to include the monetary claims here. . . . </p>

	<p id="c10830c7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Against that conclusion, respondents argue that their claims for backpay were appropriately certified as part of a class under Rule 23(b)(2) because those claims do not “predominate” over their requests for injunctive and declaratory relief.

That strategy of including only backpay claims made it more likely that monetary relief would not “predominate.” But it also created the possibility (if the predominance test were correct) that individual class members’ compensatory-damages claims would be <i>precluded</i> by litigation they had no power to hold themselves apart from. If it were determined, for example, that a particular class member is not entitled to backpay because her denial of increased pay or a promotion was <i>not</i> the product of discrimination, that employee might be collaterally estopped from independently seeking compensatory damages based on that same denial. That possibility underscores the need for plaintiffs with individual monetary claims to decide <i>for themselves</i> whether to tie their fates to the class representatives’ or go it alone—a choice Rule 23(b)(2) does not ensure that they have. . . . </p>

	<p id="c10830ca-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeals believed that it was possible to replace such proceedings with Trial by Formula. A sample set of the class members would be selected, as to whom liability for sex discrimination and the backpay owing as a result would be determined in depositions supervised by a master. The percentage of claims determined to be valid would then be applied to the entire remaining class, and the number of (presumptively) valid claims thus derived would be multiplied by the average backpay award in the sample set to arrive at the entire class recovery—without further individualized proceedings. We disapprove that novel project. Because the Rules Enabling Act forbids interpreting Rule 23 to “abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right,” 28 U.S.C. §2072(b); a class cannot be certified on the premise that Wal-Mart will not be entitled to litigate its statutory defenses to individual claims. And because the necessity of that litigation will prevent backpay from being “incidental” to the classwide injunction, respondents’ class could not be certified even assuming, <i>arguendo</i>, that “incidental” monetary relief can be awarded to a 23(b)(2) class.</p>

In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litigation, 552 F.3d 305 (3d Cir. 2008). <i>Wal-Mart</i> does not directly address this question, but its treatment of the plaintiff’s expert testimony may suggest that it is leaning in the direction of the <i>Hydrogen Peroxide</i> court.</p></li>

The possibility of a back pay award could also entice for-profit attorneys to join the plaintiffs’ team. Moreover, dropping the back pay claim could imperil or prevent certification: Could they look the court in the eye and say they were adequately representing over a million clients, many of whom, if the allegations in the complaint could be proved, had lost money in wages?</p></li>

	<p id="c108a61f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The student will already have understood that the effect of the class action is more than the simple gathering together of similar cases. That proposition is particularly true at the settlement stage—the way in which most class actions, like other lawsuits, end. Settlement presents several difficult problems unique to the class action. Most <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="868" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page868">p. 868</span>of those problems flow from the circumstance that, in many class actions (especially those created by Rule 23(b)(1) and (b)(3)), the litigative group is organized only for purposes of the lawsuit. In the most extreme cases the “group” may exist only in the abstract—as, for example, the sharers of some hypothesized interest. Yet many of the ordinary rules of litigation assume a client who hires a lawyer, guides the case, authorizes settlement, and benefits directly from any relief. Exacerbating the situation is that the class’s lawyers, on whom we have been counting to represent the class adequately, are typically negotiating their own fees at the same time as relief for the class. So the law has to worry about the potential conflict of interest: the temptation to trade a tiny bit of relief for the class for a large fee agreement. In some notorious cases preceding the enactment of the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, settlements involved large fees for the plaintiffs’ lawyers, whose clients got only coupons that might be of no value unless they chose to purchase a sometimes expensive product. Several bodies of law address these problems, taking two approaches—requiring lots of transparent process to expose conflicts and simply forbidding some forms of settlements.</p>
	<p id="c108a620-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To approach the problem, suppose counterfactually that the Supreme Court had approved the certification of a class in <i>Wal-Mart v. Dukes</i> and that, after an unsuccessful motion for summary judgment, the parties began to talk about settlement. Further suppose that the proposed settlement involved offering new promotion opportunities to existing Wal-Mart female employees, establishing a fund that would be used to give those employees additional training and education (thus enabling them to advance more quickly), and a public outreach campaign, funded by Wal-Mart, that, while not conceding any violations of law, made it known that the company had improved its practices in regard to women and was making special efforts to hire and promote women managers. Finally, suppose that the plaintiffs’ lawyers submitted a proposed fees bill of $1,500,000; you may recall that in civil rights actions like this one, a prevailing plaintiff may claim a fee from the opposing party.</p>
	<p id="c108a621-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Start with Rule 23(e), which requires court approval of a settlement of a class action. To order such approval, the judge must first “direct notice in a reasonable manner to all class members who would be bound by the proposal.” Rule 23(e)(1). This notice must occur without regard to what sort of class action is involved, but Rule 23(e) does not require individual notice. So sometimes such notices take the form of newspaper ads, online postings, radio spots, and the like. Given that some of the members of the class would have left Wal-Mart’s employment, it’s very likely that they could be reached only through such non-individualized means.</p>
	<p id="c108a622-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Such notices include information about the terms of settlement and that those objecting to the terms of the settlement may do so to the court. If the settlement involves a Rule 23(b)(3) class, it may offer a second chance for individual members to opt out of the class and the settlement. And, to prevent objectors being “bought off” by the settling parties, objections may not be withdrawn without court approval. Rule 23(e)(5). In each of these ways, class settlements look very different from ordinary settlements.</p>
	<p id="c108a623-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After such notice, the court must conduct a hearing at which it hears arguments from the settling parties about why the settlement is fair to the class members. <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="869" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page869">p. 869</span>At this hearing, the Rule permits class members to come forward to object to the settlement terms. The idea is that they will have an incentive to do so because, at least in common fund cases, the lawyer’s fee is coming out of a fund, the remainder of which will be distributed to the class. In a number of cases, objectors have come forward. Indeed, some critics say that the fairness hearings have spawned a group of professional “objectors,” who are themselves hoping to win fees by raising objections that cause the parties to add a bit to the settlement terms.</p>
	<p id="c108a624-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 adds additional features. For example, CAFA requires that, if the defendant is subject to state or federal regulation, that the regulatory authorities be notified of the suit and a pending settlement. 28 U.S.C. §1715. In the <i>Wal-Mart</i> case, both state and federal agencies that regulate labor and employment would have to be notified. Although the statute does not directly so state, the idea seems to be that a regulator could appear at a settlement hearing and offer an opinion about the appropriateness of the settlement, given its expertise regarding the unlawful acts alleged. The same notice could presumably trigger greater regulatory scrutiny if the regulator thought that the acts involved suggested other forms of unlawful behavior. Consider how the Rule and statutes interact in some hypothetical cases.</p>

	<p id="c108cd3e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In class actions, fee agreements and disputes are closely bound with settlements—because of the inherent conflict between the class and the lawyers in some settlements. In most litigation, the client pays the lawyer’s fee because she has agreed to do so, and the lawyer may not settle without the client’s agreement. Neither holds true for the class action. While the named representative party in a class action may have such an agreement, that contract does not bind absentees. Yet it may seem that the lawyer whose work has benefited the class should be paid for that work. In class actions that recover money damages, courts apply the “common fund” doctrine, described supra page 350. According to this doctrine, a plaintiff whose efforts create a fund is entitled to have those who benefit contribute to his lawyer’s fee. In class actions that create funds for distribution to class members, the doctrine is applied more directly: Courts regularly award the class lawyer a fee taken directly from the fund created by the litigation.</p>
	<p id="c108cd3f-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How should the court calculate such a fee? One school of thought is that a simple percentage is appropriate, using the analogy of contingent fee arrangements. Others point out that the key ingredient in a contingent fee calculation—the agreement between lawyer and client—is missing in the class action context. They argue instead that the proper way to calculate fees is to start with the appropriate hourly rate of the lawyer taking into account such factors as special risks, novelty of the issues, and the like. This latter method—often called “the lodestar” method, because the hourly rate provides a point of reference by which the court can “steer"—is used in federal courts, but not all states adhere to it. In practice, the two methods may often arrive at similar results.</p>
	<p id="c108cd40-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Setting these fees presents problems because most class actions settle and the fee award is made in the context of a settlement approval hearing required by Rule 23(e). At that hearing the representatives of the class and defendant, who will have agreed on an appropriate amount of fees, are unlikely to raise questions casting doubt on the agreed amount or on the vigorousness of the litigation leading to the settlement. Moreover, because the fees are negotiated at the same time as the relief going to the class members, lawyers for the class and the defendant may be tempted to put more dollars into the fees than into relief for the class, thus buying off the plaintiffs’ lawyer. A special version of this problem has arisen in so-called coupon settlements, in which members of the class get coupons—good for some discount on future purchases of cars, software, etc.—but the plaintiffs’ lawyers are paid in cash. All of these issues replicate the fundamental structural feature of the class <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="871" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page871">p. 871</span>action—that the class’s lawyer is representing a diffuse group, who cannot directly instruct or monitor the lawyer’s actions.</p>
	<p id="c108cd41-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The law addresses these problems in two ways. For all class actions, Rule 23(e) requires notice to the absent class members and a hearing and judicial finding that the proposed settlement is “fair, reasonable, and adequate.” And Rule 23(h) creates a process the court must use to approve any attorneys’ fees—including those embodied in a settlement: It requires notice, hearing, findings, and an opportunity to object to fees. Congress has specifically addressed aspects of the coupon settlement in 28 U.S.C. §1712, part of the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005. That section provides that fee awards in such a settlement must be based on the value of the coupons actually redeemed, not on the hypothetical value of the settlement if all such coupons were redeemed. Consider how some representative fee problems should be solved.</p>

	<p id="c108f461-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In class actions, damages pose an issue that rarely arises in ordinary cases: making sure that the class recovery finds its way into the hands of the class members. Class members often are unaware of the class action and subsequent recovery and consequently don’t claim damages. The nature of some types of class actions makes notice difficult. One proposed solution to the problem is the <i>fluid class recovery</i>, under which, in the case of a class consisting of past consumers that dealt with a company, damages would be distributed to future consumers through rate reductions lasting long enough to exhaust the recovery. Or the proposed relief may run to those who currently occupy the position of now-departed members of the class. The terms of the hypothetical settlement in the <i>Wal-Mart</i> case contain some such elements—training designed to benefit current employees, which will not help those who have moved to other jobs. Note that the ordinary purpose of litigation—compensation of the plaintiff for a wrong suffered—is not served by the fluid class recovery because some of the beneficiaries are not the people who have suffered the harm but merely people similar to them. Fluid class recovery thus serves to deter the defendants but not to compensate the plaintiffs. Is that a problem? Or is it a virtue?</p>

But the tables can turn. Suppose a class with great potential liability could be certified—and the claims then settled for far less than they were worth. Such a settlement might, through the doctrines of former adjudication, bar its members from individual suits. In such a situation the class action would have turned from defendant’s nightmare (“legalized blackmail” in the quotation at the start of this section) into a lawyers’ conspiracy against the class members. Is that a fair description of the next case? Or does it instead embody both fairness and creativity in the highest traditions of the legal system?</p>

Accepting the recommendation, the MDL Panel transferred all asbestos cases then filed, but not yet on trial in federal courts to a single district, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania; pursuant to the transfer order, the collected cases were consolidated for pretrial proceedings before Judge Weiner.

Untold numbers of individuals may fall within this description. All named plaintiffs alleged that they or a member of their family had been exposed to asbestos-containing products of CCR defendants. More than half of the named plaintiffs alleged that they or their family members had already suffered various physical injuries as a result of the exposure.

An exhaustive document exceeding 100 pages, the stipulation presents in detail an administrative mechanism and a schedule of payments to compensate class members who meet defined asbestos-exposure and medical requirements. The stipulation describes four categories of compensable disease: mesothelioma; lung cancer; certain “other cancers” (colon-rectal, laryngeal, esophageal, and stomach cancer); and “non-malignant conditions” (asbestosis and bilateral pleural thickening). Persons with “exceptional” medical claims—claims that do not fall within the four described diagnostic categories—may in some instances qualify for compensation, but the settlement caps the number of “exceptional” claims CCR must cover. . . . </p>

Payments under the settlement are not adjustable for inflation. Mesothelioma claimants—the most highly compensated category—are scheduled to receive between $20,000 and $200,000. The stipulation provides that CCR is to propose the level of compensation within the prescribed ranges; it also establishes procedures to resolve disputes over medical diagnoses and levels of compensation.</p>

Federal Rules take effect after an extensive deliberative process involving many reviewers: a Rules Advisory Committee, public commenters, the Judicial Conference, this Court, the Congress. The text of a rule thus proposed and reviewed limits judicial inventiveness. Courts are not free to amend a rule outside the process Congress ordered, a process properly tuned to the instruction that rules of procedure “shall not abridge. . . . any substantive right.” 28 U.S.C. §2072(b).</p>

Applying to this case criteria the rulemakers set, we conclude that the Third Circuit’s appraisal is essentially correct. Although that court should have acknowledged that settlement is a factor in the calculus, a remand is not warranted on that account. The Court of Appeals’ opinion amply demonstrates why—with or without a settlement on the table—the sprawling class the District Court certified does not satisfy Rule 23’s requirements. . . . </p>

Congress, however, has not adopted such a solution.

First, I believe that the need for settlement in this mass tort case, with hundreds of thousands of lawsuits, is greater than the Court’s opinion suggests. Second, I would give more weight than would the majority to settlement-related issues for purposes of determining whether common issues predominate. Third, I am uncertain about the Court’s determination of adequacy of representation, and do not believe it appropriate for this Court to second-guess the District Court on the matter without first having the Court of Appeals consider it. Fourth, I am uncertain about the tenor of an opinion that seems to suggest the settlement is unfair. And fifth, in the absence of further review by the Court of Appeals, I cannot accept the majority’s suggestions that “notice” is inadequate. . . . </p>

	<li class=""><p id="c109b6f7-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In many ordinary, single-plaintiff/single-defendant cases, the parties settle before suit is filed. To use the asbestos context, a lawyer for a former shipyard worker alleging injuries from inhalation of asbestos dust could approach an asbestos manufacturer and settle the claim without ever filing a complaint. Why didn’t the parties do so in <i>Amchem</i>? Why <i>couldn’t</i> they do so if they wanted the settlement to have the intended effect?</p></li>
	<li class=""><p id="c109b6f8-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What did the parties—in particular the defendants—want to get from class certification that they could not have gotten in any other way?</p></li>

	<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-lcletter">
	<li class=""><p id="c109b6fa-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There were individual claimants who had filed complaints against various asbestos manufacturers (the so-called inventory claimants). These cases had been consolidated (under the provision for Multidistrict Litigation, 28 U.S.C. §1407). These claims could have been settled without regard to class certification; indeed, it was the discussion of their settlement that led to the proposed class action.</p></li>
	<li class=""><p id="c109b6fb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Who, then, were the other members of the class?</p></li>

	<li class=""><p id="c109b6fd-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has emphasized that it meant what it said in <i>Amchem</i> about the avoidance of conflicts of interest by lawyers representing classes. Striking down another asbestos settlement class in Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 815 (1999), the Court said:</p>

	<p id="c109de0e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One may take a settlement amount as good evidence of the maximum available if one can assume that parties of equal knowledge and negotiating skill agreed upon the figure through arms-length bargaining, unhindered by any considerations tugging against the interests of the parties ostensibly represented in the negotiation. But no such assumption may be indulged in this case, or probably in any class action settlement with the potential for gigantic fees. In this case, <div class="pagebreak"></div><span title="881" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page881">p. 881</span>certainly, any assumption that plaintiffs’ counsel could be of a mind to do their simple best in bargaining for the benefit of the settlement class is patently at odds with the fact that at least some of the same lawyers representing plaintiffs and the class had also negotiated the separate settlement of 45,000 pending claims, the full payment of which was contingent on a successful global settlement agreement or the successful resolution of the insurance coverage dispute. . . . Class counsel thus had great incentive to reach any agreement in the global settlement negotiations that they thought might survive a Rule 23(e) fairness hearing, rather than the best possible arrangement for the substantially unidentified global settlement class. . . . The resulting incentive to favor the known plaintiffs in the earlier settlement was, indeed, an egregious example of the conflict noted in <i>Amchem</i> resulting from divergent interests of the presently injured and future claimants.</p>

	<li class=""><p id="c109de11-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For an example of an approved settlement class, see Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1020-21 (9th Cir. 1997), in which plaintiffs sued an auto manufacturer alleging a defective latch in a van’s door. Affirming the district court’s approval of a settlement class, the Ninth Circuit carefully distinguished <i>Amchem</i>:</p>
	<div class="epub-blockquote">
	<p id="c109de12-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the heart of <i>Amchem</i> was concern over settlement allocation decisions; asbestos manufacturers had a designated amount of money that was not fairly distributed between present and future claimants. The <i>Amchem</i> settlement eliminated all present and future claims against asbestos manufacturers, with class counsel attempting to represent both groups of plaintiffs. The Supreme Court found this dual representation to be particularly troubling, given that present plaintiffs had a clear interest in a settlement that maximized current funds, while future plaintiffs had a strong interest in preserving funds for their future needs and protecting the total fund against inflation.</p>
	<p id="c109de13-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unlike the class in <i>Amchem</i>, this class of minivan owners does not present an allocation dilemma. Potential plaintiffs are not divided into conflicting discrete categories, such as those with present health problems and those who may develop symptoms in the future. Rather, each potential plaintiff has the same problem: an allegedly defective rear latchgate which requires repair or commensurate compensation. The differences in severity of personal injury present in <i>Amchem</i> are avoided here by excluding personal injury and wrongful death claims. Similarly, there is no structural conflict of interest based on variations in state law, for the named representatives include individuals from each state, and the differences in state remedies are not sufficiently substantial so as to warrant the creation of subclasses. Representatives of other potential subclasses are included among the named representatives, including owners of every minivan model. However, even if the named representatives did not include a broad cross-section of claimants, the prospects for irreparable conflict of interest are minimal in this case because of the relatively small differences in damages and potential remedies.</p>

	<li class=""><p id="c109de15-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For an example of a settlement device that achieves many of the goals of the settlement class without the defects found in <i>Amchem</i>, consider a settlement between a pharmaceutical house and plaintiffs not certified as a class. Merck manufactured a widely prescribed pain medicine, Vioxx, which was withdrawn from the market after it was alleged to increase the risk of heart disease. Twenty-six thousand lawsuits followed, some from survivors of those who had died of heart disease after taking the drug, others from those who had suffered some identifiable health harm, and still others who alleged only increased anxiety and stress from fear of future effects. As in <i>Amchem</i>, many of these were consolidated before a single federal district judge pursuant to the multidistrict litigation provisions. Merck defended the claims initially, trying a number, losing some big verdicts but winning the majority of the cases (15 out of 20, according to one news report). Plaintiffs’ and defendant’s lawyers then negotiated a global settlement, providing a total of $5 billion to be disbursed according to a schedule, with claimants suffering death or serious injury receiving amounts in excess of $1 million, but those with less serious injuries far less. The part of the settlement that resembles the <i>Amchem</i> settlement class are three provisions: (1) that the plaintiffs’ lawyers recommend it to their clients; (2) that the settlement would not go into effect unless 85 percent of all claimants accepted the settlement; and (3) that the plaintiffs’ lawyers agreed not to represent any plaintiff who chooses not to accept the settlement. Are the first and third provisions consistent with the lawyer’s duty to his client?</p></li>

	<li class=""><p id="c109de16-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As one can gather from the disagreement between majority and dissent, the judiciary, academia, and the bar are divided on the desirability of settlements like <i>Amchem</i> and <i>Ortiz</i>—and perhaps that in the Vioxx case just described.</p>

	<li class=""><p id="c109de19-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In part, one’s assessment may depend on one’s assumptions about the alternatives. If one thinks that the alternative is an expeditiously conducted civil trial, much of the straining to find that the settlement did not breach either the principles of due process or of professional ethics will seem unnecessary and undesirable. One can find some evidence to support the thesis that the “ordinary” litigation system was developing methods of coping with the asbestos cases.</p></li>
	<li class=""><p id="c109de1a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If one thinks that the alternative is the death or financial destitution of those waiting in line for such a civil trial, then the district courts’ rulings in <i>Amchem</i> and <i>Ortiz</i> will seem both humane and sensible. One can find some evidence that the litigation system was drowning in asbestos litigation and that litigation expenses, including lawyers’ fees, were consuming two-thirds of the amounts recovered.</p></li>

Some who would accept the argument that courts were doing badly with asbestos litigation would nevertheless say that there were other institutions that could have and should have responded.</p>

	<li class=""><p id="c109de1c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One candidate was Congress, which could have created an administrative system (like that for workers’ compensation) for dealing with the asbestos claims. The Black Lung Benefits Act, 30 U.S.C. §§901 et seq., might have provided a model. Under the Act, funded by a tax on coal, miners who show disability produced by exposure to coal dust collect benefits from a federal agency. As the opinion in <i>Amchem</i> noted, Congress has not acted in a similar way in the case of asbestos. Does that mean that the courts should act on their own? Or has the courts’ search for solutions taken the political heat off Congress and thereby thwarted a legislative solution?</p></li>
	<li class=""><p id="c109de1d-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another candidate was the bankruptcy courts. Some have argued that bankruptcy courts are in the business of collective litigation: They regularly resolve cases in which large numbers of creditors have claims against an entity. Moreover, they are expressly vested with the power to do the sort of quasi-administrative tasks achieved by the proposed settlement. One theoretical objection to the settlement class in <i>Ortiz</i> was that by using Rule 23(b)(1) and a limited fund rationale, the defendants were seeking the sort of protection they might have achieved in bankruptcy without subjecting themselves to the powers of a bankruptcy proceeding that might have dug much more deeply into their pockets.</p></li>

If Manufacturer were not already a party, a Rule 14 third-party claim would be appropriate. But because Manufacturer is already a party (and this claim arises out of the same transaction or occurrence), a cross-claim is the correct route to go.</p>
	<p id="c10a7a84-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q1B.</b> The correct response is 1—an answer, in which the Manufacturer would simply deny liability; in the course of litigation it could tell its version of events—that the Dealer must have done it.</p>

Because this crossclaim does not arise from the same transaction or occurrence as the main claim, Rule 13(g) does not permit its assertion. Manufacturer will need to file a separate action against Dealer.</p>
	<p id="c10a7a86-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q1D.</b> The correct response is 3—a counterclaim. Because this counterclaim is not transactionally related, it is permissive and therefore no supplemental jurisdiction will attach, but Rule 13(b) permits its assertion.</p>

	<p id="c10a7a89-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q3.</b> A and B are the correct responses. A is correct because the third-party claim falls within 28 U.S.C. §1367(a) and does not fall within the exclusions of §1367(b). B is correct because as to the counterclaim Buyer is a “defending party” within the meaning of Rule 14. C is wrong: By the plain language of §1367(b), language the courts have interpreted according to its literal meaning, no supplemental jurisdiction extends to claims by plaintiffs (here Buyer) against persons made parties under Rule 14 (here Online) if doing so would defeat diversity. So, if Buyer and Online are citizens of the same state, there is no supplemental jurisdiction. The drafters may well have meant to extend supplemental jurisdiction in this situation, but the courts have said that the statute means what its language says.</p>
	<p id="c10a7a8a-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q4.</b> D is the only correct response. A is incorrect because Dealer can cast all the blame it likes but the judgment won’t bind Manufacturer and won’t impair or impede Manufacturer’s ability to defend its interests: Defendants regularly try to cast blame on some absent party. B is wrong because, as <i>Temple v. Synthes</i> demonstrates, Rule 19 does not require plaintiffs to package their lawsuits in the most efficient possible form. C is wrong because, though Buyer may sue Driver, his exclusion from the first suit doesn’t impair or impede his ability to defend himself if that suit does occur.</p>
	<p id="c10a7a8b-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q5.</b> Both A and B are correct. A is correct because the new students can make a plausible case that “as a practical matter” the Regents’ action will decrease the funds available for their education. (The new students would be a Rule 23(b)(2) class.) B is correct because, if they have read <i>Martin v. Wilks</i> and want to bind both current and future students, the Regents will want to join them.</p>
	<p id="c10a7a8c-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Q6.</b> A, B, and C are the correct responses. A is correct because one of the consequences of opting out of a class action is that one neither receives its benefits, if any, nor its burdens. B is correct because, since this was a Rule 23(b)(3) suit, plaintiff’s counsel was obligated by Rule 26(c)(2)(B), as well as <i>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust</i>, to provide individual notice to “all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.” C is correct because <i>Hansberry v. Lee</i> permits collateral attack on a class judgment by one alleging inadequate representation.</p>

A is correct because the apparently conflicting wishes of the parents might well defeat both the typicality and the adequacy representation requirements of Rule 23(a). B is correct because such a lawyer would be very unlikely to be able—as a matter of professional competence—adequately to represent the class. D is very likely correct because part of representative adequacy includes the ability to finance the lawsuit. C is wrong because this will be a (b)(2) class, which would not require individual notice to all class members (though some form of notice would likely be required).</p>

Rule 14(a) grants federal courts discretion in determining the propriety of a third party complaint, and in making its determination, a court may consider the burden upon the litigation that might ensue, as well as the merit of the third party complaint. . . . Rules 21 and 42 further provide original plaintiffs protection against vexatious litigation by permitting the court to drop parties or to sever claims. In the present matter, the court deems it appropriate to allow the factual record to develop so that the role of ITW’s products in the allegedly defective chicken houses can be determined. Under the rationale that a stitch in time saves nine, the court considers it more efficient to determine liability presently rather than to risk potential relitigation on all the issues at a later date.

United States, 440 U.S. 147, 154-155 (1979) (control of litigation on behalf of one of the parties in the litigation). Additionally, where a special remedial scheme exists expressly foreclosing successive litigation by nonlitigants, as for example in bankruptcy or probate, legal proceedings may terminate pre-existing rights if the scheme is otherwise consistent with due process. See NLRB v. Bildisco &amp; Bildisco, 465 U.S. 513, 529-530, n.10 (1984) (“proof of claim must be presented to the Bankruptcy Court. . . . or be lost”); Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc. v.

On the other hand, the dissent characterizes respondents’ suit not as an assertion of their own independent rights, but as a collateral attack on the consent decree which, it is said, can only proceed on very limited grounds. Respondents in their suit have alleged that they are being racially discriminated against by their employer in violation of Title VII: either the fact that the disputed employment decisions are being made pursuant to a consent decree is a defense to respondents’ Title VII claims or it is not. If it is a defense to challenges to employment practices which would otherwise violate Title VII, it is very difficult to see why respondents are not being “bound” by the decree.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c104fc70-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="#ftN10CE4_d5444dc6-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" id="note-N10CE4_d5444dc6-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*4</a></span>&nbsp;The former comment comes from Pomerantz, <i>New Developments in Class Actions—Has Their Death Knell Been Sounded?</i>, 25 Bus.

Both serve as guideposts for determining whether under the particular circumstances maintenance of a class action is economical and whether the named plaintiff’s claim and the class claims are so interrelated that the interests of the class members will be fairly and adequately protected in their absence. Those requirements therefore also tend to merge with the adequacy-of-representation requirement, although the latter requirement also raises concerns about the competency of class counsel and conflicts of interest.” In light of our disposition of the commonality question, however, it is unnecessary to resolve whether respondents have satisfied the typicality and adequate-representation requirements of Rule 23(a).</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c107e28e-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="#ftN11348_d5444dc6-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" id="note-N11348_d5444dc6-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">6</a></span>&nbsp;A statement in one of our prior cases, Eisen v. Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177 (1974), is sometimes mistakenly cited to the contrary: “We find nothing in either the language or history of Rule 23 that gives a court any authority to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the merits of a suit in order to determine whether it may be maintained as a class action.” But in that case, the judge had conducted a preliminary inquiry into the merits of a suit, not in order to determine the propriety of certification under Rules 23(a) and (b) (he had already done that), but in order to shift the cost of notice required by Rule 23(c)(2) from the plaintiff to the defendants. To the extent the quoted statement goes beyond the permissibility of a merits inquiry for any other pretrial purpose, it is the purest dictum and is contradicted by our other cases. . . . </p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c107e290-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="#ftN11359_d5444dc6-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" id="note-N11359_d5444dc6-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">7</a></span>&nbsp;In a pattern-or-practice case, the plaintiff tries to “establish by a preponderance of the evidence that. . . . discrimination was the company’s standard operating procedure[,] the regular rather than the unusual practice.” If he succeeds, that showing will support a rebuttable inference that all class members were victims of the discriminatory practice, and will justify “an award of prospective relief,” such as “an injunctive order against the continuation of the discriminatory practice.”</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c10830d0-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="#ftN11457_d5444dc6-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" id="note-N11457_d5444dc6-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">1</a></span>&nbsp;The plaintiffs requested Rule 23(b)(3) certification as an alternative, should their request for (b)(2) certification fail.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c1091b85-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="#ftN11660_d5444dc6-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" id="note-N11660_d5444dc6-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">*6</a></span>&nbsp;[As the opinion elsewhere explained, the steering committees referred to persons who had already filed claims as “inventory plaintiffs,” distinguishing them from those who had not yet experienced illness or filed any claim, to whom they referred as “exposure-only” cases.—<span class="epub-small-caps">Eds</span>.]</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c1094297-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="#ftN1166F_d5444dc6-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" id="note-N1166F_d5444dc6-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">3</a></span>&nbsp;It is basic to comprehension of this proceeding to notice that no transferred case is included in the settlement at issue, and no case covered by the settlement existed as a civil action at the time of the MDL transfer.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c10969bb-03a4-11e9-8c02-1bc59f72013d"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="#ftN116E2_d5444dc6-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48" id="note-N116E2_d5444dc6-e760-11e8-8891-156bcdd81e48">16</a></span>&nbsp;Portions of the opinion dissenting in part appear to assume that settlement counts only one way—in favor of certification. To the extent that is the dissent’s meaning, we disagree. Settlement, though a relevant factor, does not inevitably signal that class action certification should be granted more readily than it would be were the case to be litigated. For reasons the Third Circuit aired, proposed settlement classes sometimes warrant more, not less caution on the question of certification.</p></div>

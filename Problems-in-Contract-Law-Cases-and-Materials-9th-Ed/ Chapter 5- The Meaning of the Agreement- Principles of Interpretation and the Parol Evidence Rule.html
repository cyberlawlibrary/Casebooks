<div class="cc-section epub-section epub-anyhead" id="035bdf21-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56">
<p id="035bdf22-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At this point in our studies, we have seen enough to realize that issues affecting the outcome of contractual disputes can be divided roughly into questions of “substance” and “form.” To the extent that contract law is concerned with the actual assent of the parties to an asserted contract, one might characterize this as concern with the “substance” of their agreement. Questions such as “Was an offer truly made?” or “Was an acceptance manifested?” would seem to fall into this category. By contrast, the various “statutes of frauds” discussed in the preceding chapter seem to be requirements not of substance, but only of “form” — the expression of an agreement in a particular medium and with a particular indicium of assent. Of course, this distinction between substance and form tends (like many others) to blur somewhat on closer examination: The requirement of “definiteness,” for instance, seems (for some courts at least) to be an issue of form as well as substance; thoughtful application of the statute of frauds is likely to be concerned not merely with the minimum requirements of form but also with the issue of real agreement. And commentators have debated whether the requirement of consideration is truly one of form or of substance (or both). Nevertheless, the distinction between form and substance has appeared to many to be a useful one. See, e.g., Lon Fuller, Consideration and Form, 41 Colum. L. Rev. 799 (1941); P.S. Atiyah &amp; Robert S. Summers, Form and Substance in Anglo-American Law (1987).</p>
<p id="035bdf23-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chapter 5 continues this parallel and to some extent overlapping examination of form and substance in contract law. The first section of this chapter is devoted to the methods employed by courts to interpret the parties’ expressions of assent. Even where the parties have initially agreed on particular words and phrases to describe their contemplated exchange of performances, they may disagree later about the meaning that should be attached to those manifestations of agreement. In the second section of this chapter we examine the particular problems of interpretation that arise when the <span title="396" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-396">p. 396</span>parties have chosen to memorialize their agreement in a written document. As we have seen, the law does not require all types of contracts to be in writing in order to be enforceable, and even those that are within the scope of a statute of frauds usually do not have to be written out in complete and exhaustive detail. Where the parties have prepared a written agreement, one of them may later contend that this writing does not accurately or completely express their “true” agreement — that there were additional agreements made between them not contained in the writing, or even that the writing in some respect describes their agreement in an inaccurate or misleading fashion. Courts over the years have worked out a method of screening evidence of such “extrinsic” matters, through the application of the so-called “parol evidence rule.” The meaning and application of that rule is examined in the latter part of this chapter.</p>

<p id="035c0636-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Language is a system of symbols by which we express ideas. But, as we all know, language as a medium for expression of ideas is far from perfect. The words a person uses may not fully express the ideas that the person was trying to convey. Even when people appear to be using the same words, they may attribute different meaning to those words. Contracts, like other linguistic expressions, suffer from these problems of meaning. In these materials we use the term <i>interpretation</i> to refer to the process by which a court gives meaning to contractual language when the parties attach materially different meanings to that language. Some courts and writers have drawn a distinction between <i>interpretation</i> — the process of determining the meaning that the parties attributed to contractual language — and <i>construction</i>, which is the judicial role in determining the legal effect of that language. These materials will ordinarily use the term <i>interpretation</i> to include construction, a usage favored by modern contract theorists because the distinction between interpretation and construction is both cumbersome and usually unnecessary. See E. Allan Farnsworth, Contracts §7.7 (4th ed. 2004).</p>
<p id="035c0637-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Over the first three-quarters of the nineteenth century, English and American courts adopted a “subjective” approach to problems of interpretation. Under the subjectivist view, if the parties attributed materially different meanings to contractual language, no contract was formed. Courts reasoned that the formation of a contract required a “meeting of the minds.”</p>
<p id="035c0638-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The prime example of the subjectivist approach to contractual interpretation is the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus, 159 Eng. Rep. 375 (1864), often referred to as the “Peerless Case.” In <i>Raffles</i>, two merchants entered into a contract for the sale of cotton to arrive “ex Peerless from Bombay.” In fact there were two ships named Peerless that were sailing from Bombay, one leaving in October, the other in December. The seller contemplated making delivery by the December Peerless, while the buyer expected the cotton to be shipped on <span title="397" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-397">p. 397</span>the October Peerless. When the buyer refused to take delivery in December, the seller brought suit for breach of contract. The Court of Exchequer held for the buyer, accepting his plea that because “the defendant meant one Peerless and the plaintiff another . . . there was no consensus ad idem, and therefore no binding contract.” Id. at 376.</p>
<p id="035c0639-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In his lectures on the common law, given in 1881, Holmes criticized the subjective theory, arguing that courts should instead adopt an “external” approach to contractual interpretation. In a later article Holmes defended his theory of interpretation on two grounds: (1) The subjective approach made enforcement of contracts too difficult; (2) The external method was fair because a speaker should always expect his words to be understood in accordance with their normal usage. Oliver Wendell Holmes, The Theory of Legal Interpretation, 12 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 419 (1899). Professor Williston, both in his treatise and in the original Restatement, presented a systematic, “objective” theory of contractual interpretation. Under this theory, words and conduct should be interpreted in accordance with the standard of a reasonable person familiar with the circumstances, rather than in accordance with the subjective intention of either of the parties. Restatement §§230, 233. This objective approach, however, led to the striking conclusion that contractual language could be given a meaning that <i>neither</i> of the parties intended. Restatement §230, Comment <i>b.</i> Consider Illustration 1 to §230 of the first Restatement:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">

In an integrated agreement <i>A</i> promises to sell, and <i>B</i> promises to buy certain patents. <i>A</i> intends to sell only English patents on a certain invention. <i>B</i> understands that <i>A</i> promises to sell the English, French, and American patents on the invention. If a reasonably intelligent person . . . would understand the agreement to state a promise to sell the English and American patents, but not the French patents, there is a contract and <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are bound by that meaning.</p>

<p id="035c063b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Modern contract law has departed from the extreme objectivist approach, adopting instead what could be characterized as a modified objective approach. Professor Corbin laid the foundation of the modern approach in his treatise. According to Corbin, in interpreting a contract, a court should answer two questions: (1) Whose meaning controls the interpretation of the contract? (2) What was that party’s meaning? 3 Corbin on Contracts §536 (1960), at 31-32. Corbin thought that it would be absurd for a court to give a contract a meaning that neither of the parties intended.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="035c063c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If a court says that parties are bound by this meaning even though neither one of them held it, it is very probable that the court believes, either that both of them did in fact hold it, or that one of them did and the other had reason to know that he did. But to hold that, although <i>A</i> intends to sell Blackacre and <i>B</i> intends to buy Whiteacre, <i>A</i> must convey and <i>B</i> must accept Greenacre because their “integration” would so be understood by <i>C</i> or by a large community of third persons, is to hold justice up to ridicule.</p>

The updated version of the Corbin treatise continues to embrace the modified objective approach which “would never enable a court to impose an interpretation on the parties that was reasonably held by a third party but that differed from what the contracting parties understood or had reason to understand.” Margaret N. Kniffin, 5 Corbin on Contracts §24.6 (Joseph M. Perillo ed., 1998).</p>
<p id="035c063e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Restatement (Second) follows Corbin’s view. Section 200 states that the purpose of interpretation is the determination of meaning of contractual language. Under §201(1), if both parties do in fact attach the same meaning to a provision, that meaning will govern. Thus, the mutual understanding of the parties controls, even if it is different from the interpretation that would be given to the contract by a reasonable person. Restatement (Second) §203, Comment <i>c.</i> As the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals said:</p>

As Professor Lawrence Solan has noted, the law’s willingness to enforce a meaning which both parties actually intended, even where this diverges from the “plain” or “reasonable” meaning of the words, represents not a true “objective” standard, but one based on mutual assent. Lawrence M. Solan, Contract as Agreement, 83 Notre Dame L. Rev. 353, 358-364 (2007). If the parties attach different meanings to their contractual language, however, the agreement is to be interpreted in accordance with the meaning of one party if the other party either knew or had reason to know of the meaning attached by the former. Restatement (Second) §201(2).</p>
<p id="035c2d51-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In many cases, therefore, the crucial issue in interpreting a contract is whether one party knew (or had reason to know) of the meaning attached to the contract by the other. If so, the party having knowledge or reason to know is bound by the meaning of the other. Restatement (Second) §201(2)(b); Margaret N. Kniffin, 5 Corbin on Contracts §24.5 (Joseph M.

<p id="035c2d52-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What if a court should conclude that the parties did indeed attach different meanings to a material term of the contract, but neither party knew or had reason to know the meaning of the other? Then, even under the modern approach of the Restatement (Second), the result in <i>Raffles</i> would still follow: No contract exists because of the absence of mutual assent.

<p id="035c2d58-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is an action for rents allegedly due under the terms of a lease. Plaintiff, Marguerite B. Joyner, owns real property known as Waters Edge Office Park. To develop the property into an office park, plaintiff and her husband, William T. Joyner, Jr., contracted with Brown Investment Company (Brown) in 1972. Brown agreed, under the “Base Lease,” to lease the property from plaintiff at an annual rent, increased each year to correspond with the increase in the Wholesale Price Index, published by the United States Department of Labor. The parties contemplated that Brown would remove all existing buildings, regrade the property, prepare an appropriate land plan, and subdivide the area into individual lots. When each lot was subdivided, the lease called for the execution of individual “Lot Leases” to take the place of the Base Lease. The rent due under the Lot Leases was based, in part, on the occupancy of buildings planned for each lot.</p>
<p id="035c2d59-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Due to financial difficulties suffered by Brown, the lease was amended in 1975 to substitute defendant, J. R. Adams, as the lessee/developer. The amendment also suspended the annual rent increases. Instead, defendant agreed to pay a fixed rate until 30 September 1980, at which time he was obligated to have subdivided “all of the undeveloped land . . . whereby all portions are deemed lots and eligible for the execution of a [Lot Lease].” If defendant failed to comply with that provision, the amendment required him to pay, retroactively, the amount of rent which would have been due under the terms of the Base Lease. As of 30 September 1980, defendant had executed separate lot leases and had built buildings on all lots except one. Defendant had, however, subdivided the remaining lot, graded it, installed water and sewer lines on it, and built all planned roads and driveways leading to the lot. A building was not built on the lot and a Lot Lease was not executed until late 1982.</p>
<p id="035c2d5a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff filed this action on 27 September 1983, claiming that defendant failed to comply with the requirements of the lease for developing the property and seeking to recover the difference between the actual, fixed rent paid by defendant and the rent recomputed under the terms of the Base Lease. On 5 July 1985, summary judgment was granted for defendant. In an unpublished opinion, 80 N.C. App. 166, 341 S.E.2d 619, this court reversed, holding that the provision of the 1975 amendment relating to the conditions upon which the retroactive rent escalation would occur was ambiguous. Consequently, the case was remanded for a factual determination of the parties’ intent.</p>
<p id="035c2d5b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On remand, the trial court, sitting without a jury, found that plaintiff intended the escalation clause to require defendant to complete, or at least be ready to begin, construction of all buildings planned for the lot. It also found, however, that defendant intended the clause to require only the subdivision of all lots or, at most, whatever development was necessary to prepare the lot for building construction. The court concluded there was “no meeting of the minds” on the question of what conditions would trigger the rent escalation. <span title="400" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-400">p. 400</span>The court also concluded that, although the parties had different intentions, the ambiguity should be resolved against defendant, who was “the party that drafted the 1975 amended lease.” Accordingly, the court awarded plaintiff damages in the stipulated amount of $93,695.75. Defendant appeals. . . . </p>

<p id="035c546d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>I</b></p>
<p id="035c546e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both parties argue that the trial court erred in concluding that there was no “meeting of the minds” on the rent escalation provision. Each contends that there is no evidentiary basis for finding the other party had a contrary intention. A trial court’s findings of fact, however, are conclusive on appeal if supported by competent evidence, Hill v. Town of Hillsborough, 48 N.C. App. 553, 269 S.E.2d 303 (1980), and there is evidence here to support the trial court’s findings.</p>
<p id="035c546f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff introduced three memoranda written during the negotiation process. One, written to Mr. Joyner by Mr. Mark Lynch, an accountant negotiating on behalf of the Joyners, stated that defendant “would agree” that completion of all buildings within five years would be required to avoid retroactive recomputation of the rent under the Base Lease. The other two memoranda, one written by defendant’s negotiator, Mr. Ed Clark, referred to the “completed development” of the property as a possible condition to avoiding rent escalation. Mr. Lynch testified that he and Mr. Joyner interpreted “completed development” to mean the construction of all buildings. In addition, plaintiff testified that she expressed to defendant her wish that the contract contain a more specific provision regarding the construction of buildings on the lots. This evidence is sufficient to support the trial court’s finding that plaintiff intended the provision in question to require defendant at least to have begun construction of all buildings on the lots.</p>
<p id="035c5470-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant argues that, when read in conjunction with the terms of the Base Lease, his interpretation is the only reasonable interpretation of the rent escalation provision. That argument was rejected in this court’s previous decision in this case. The law of the case is that the language in the amendment is ambiguous and susceptible to more than one reasonable meaning, even when considered with the terms of the Base Lease.</p>
<p id="035c5471-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Contrary to plaintiff’s contention, there is also evidence that defendant attributed a different meaning to the disputed provision. The evidence indisputably shows that both parties intended the rent escalation clause to require defendant to develop all the property by 30 September 1980. Defendant’s evidence showed that, in the local real estate market, a lot is considered “developed” when water and sewer lines are installed and the lot is otherwise ready for the construction of a building. Defendant also established that he was an experienced commercial real estate developer and that Mr. Joyner had personal experience in the real estate business. There is, therefore, competent evidence to support the trial court’s finding that defendant intended the provision to require, at most, what he actually accomplished by 30 September 1980.</p>
<p id="035c5472-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In arguing that her meaning was the only one intended by the parties, plaintiff specifically cites evidence of her purpose in entering the lease with defendant <span title="401" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-401">p. 401</span>as well as evidence of the conduct of the parties after the lease was executed. Evidence of the parties’ purposes in entering a contract and their conduct after the agreement is some evidence of their intent. See Century Communications v. Housing Authority of City of Wilson, 313 N.C. 143, 326 S.E.2d 261 (1985). However, much of the evidence relied on by plaintiff, as well as other evidence in the record, can support more than one inference. Which among those possible inferences should be deemed credible and worthy of belief is a decision for the trial court. See Williams v. Insurance Co., 288 N.C. 338, 218 S.E.2d 368 (1975). The evidence here does not show, as a matter of law, what effect the parties intended the language in the rent escalation provision to have. Therefore, while the evidence and applicable rules of interpretation would have permitted the trial court to find plaintiff’s meaning was intended by both parties, they clearly did not compel that finding. It is not the province of this court to reweigh the evidence. . . . </p>
<p id="035c5473-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>II</b></p>
<p id="035c5474-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is axiomatic that where parties have attributed different meanings to a term within a contract, there is no “meeting of the minds” on that provision and a court will not enforce either party’s meaning. See O’Grady v. Bank, 296 N.C. 212, 250 S.E.2d 587 (1978); Elliott v. Duke University, 66 N.C. App. 590, 311 S.E.2d 632, <i>disc. rev. denied,</i> 311 N.C. 754, 321 S.E.2d 132 (1984); Restatement (Second) of Contracts, sections 20, 201 (1979) (difference must be “material”); Frigaliment Importing Co. v. B.N.S. International Sales Corp., 190 F. Supp. 116 (S.D.N.Y. 1960). Consequently, having found divergent meanings between the parties, the trial court did not err in concluding there was no meeting of the minds on the question of what conditions would trigger the retroactive rent escalation.</p>
<p id="035c5475-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is also well-established, although not often enunciated in North Carolina cases, that, where one party knows or has reason to know what the other party means by certain language and the other party does not know or have reason to know of the meaning attached to the disputed language by the first party, the court will enforce the contract in accordance with the innocent party’s meaning. See Insurance Agency v. Leasing Corp., 31 N.C. App. 490, 229 S.E.2d 697 (1976); Restatement (Second) of Contracts, sections 20, 201(2) (1979); 3 Corbin, Contracts, section 537 (1960 and Supp. 1984). In fact, it seems that a determination of whether either or both parties knew or had reason to know of a different meaning attributed by the other is essential in almost every case where the court finds a lack of mutual assent. Id. Here, much of the evidence of the negotiations reflects directly on each party’s knowledge of what the other party intended the provision to require. Since the trial court failed to make findings of fact on that crucial question, this case must be remanded.</p>
<p id="035c5476-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . In this case, whether the parties knew or had reason to know of the other’s meaning of the disputed language is essential to the proper determination of the contract’s enforceability. Accordingly, we remand for findings of fact on that issue.</p>
<p id="035c5477-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In remanding, we necessarily find that the trial court erred in awarding judgment for plaintiff based on the rule that ambiguity in contract terms must be <span title="402" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-402">p. 402</span>construed most strongly against the party which drafted the contract. See Root v. Insurance Co., supra; Restatement (Second) of Contracts, section 206 (1979). The rule is essentially one of legal effect, of “construction” rather than “interpretation,” since “it can scarcely be said to be designed to ascertain the meanings attached by the parties.” Farnsworth, Contracts, section 7.11, page 500 (1982). The rule’s application rests on a public policy theory that the party who chose the word is more likely to have provided more carefully for the protection of his own interests, is more likely to have had reason to know of uncertainties, and may have even left the meaning deliberately obscure. Id.; Restatement (Second) Contracts, section 206, comment a (1979); 3 Corbin supra, section 559. Consequently, the rule is usually applied in cases involving an adhesion contract or where one party is in a stronger bargaining position, although it is not necessarily limited to those situations. Id. In this case, where the parties were at arms length and were equally sophisticated, we believe the rule was improvidently invoked.</p>
<p id="035c5478-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before this rule of construction should be applied, the record should affirmatively show that “the form of expression in words was actually chosen by one [party] rather than by the other.” 3 Corbin supra, section 559 at 266. The only evidence admitted regarding who drafted the 1975 amendment is Mr. Joyner’s testimony that no one in his law firm had anything to do with it. Even assuming this is sufficient to support an inference that defendant or his agent wrote the provision, it does not establish that defendant can be charged with having chosen its language.</p>
<p id="035c7b89-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The record reveals that both parties are experienced in the real estate business and that they bargained from essentially equal positions of power. The record also shows the parties engaged in a fairly protracted negotiation process, with the provision in question undergoing particular scrutiny. Nothing in the record shows that it was defendant, rather than plaintiff, who “drafted” the provision. Instead, it appears that the language was assented to by parties who had both the knowledge to understand its import and the bargaining power to alter it. Therefore, the policy behind the rule is not served in its application here and the trial court erred in using the rule to award judgment for plaintiff. . . . </p>
<p id="035c7b8a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If, on remand, the trial court finds that defendant knew or had reason to know what meaning plaintiff attached to the disputed terminology and that plaintiff did not know or have reason to know of the meaning attached to the disputed language by defendant, the trial court should conclude that there is a contract as to the plaintiff’s meaning. Otherwise, plaintiff’s claim does not prevail.</p>

<li class=""><p id="035c7b91-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Subsequent proceedings in</i> Joyner. When the <i>Joyner</i> case was heard again on remand, the trial court found that the defendant neither knew nor had reason to know of the plaintiff’s meaning, and therefore it held for the defendant. In affirming this decision, the court of appeals referred to the following evidence to support the trial court’s finding of fact regarding the defendant’s lack of knowledge or reason to know of the plaintiff’s meaning:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="035c7b92-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We determine that at least four instances of competent evidence exist to support the trial court’s finding. First, plaintiff’s testimony reveals two versions of her meaning of the conditions triggering the recomputation agreement. Her initial testimony was that “completed building” was the condition for avoiding recomputation. However, her subsequent testimony was that the condition meant “completed buildings” <i>and</i> tenant occupation of the buildings. Plaintiff also testified about her inexperience and unfamiliarity with commercial real estate transactions.</p>
<p id="035c7b93-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, even if plaintiff did not have more than one meaning, plaintiff’s lack of direct communication with defendant during negotiations was insufficient to give defendant reason to know that either version of plaintiff’s meaning of the conditions triggering the recomputation provision differed from defendant’s meaning. In negotiations, plaintiff did not meet with defendant; she was represented by her husband-attorney and several accountants. Nowhere does the record show that plaintiff’s negotiators conveyed either version of plaintiff’s meaning to defendant.</p>
<p id="035ca2a4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The third instance is the lack of evidence that defendant assented to the contract in reliance on a “completed building” meaning of the recomputation conditions. The record shows that plaintiff’s negotiators recommended a “completed building” clause for the recomputation provision without stating whether it was plaintiff who requested the recommendation. The record also shows that defendant flatly rejected plaintiff’s negotiators’ recommendation that the agreement recomputation provision include “completed building” language. Subsequent to defendant’s rejection, the record shows that none of <span title="404" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-404">p. 404</span>plaintiff’s negotiators informed defendant that plaintiff knew of defendant’s rejection, that plaintiff disagreed with defendant’s rejection, or that defendant’s rejection was to have no effect.</p>
<p id="035ca2a5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The fourth instance is defendant’s evidence showing that his previous extensive business knowledge and experience with commercial real estate transactions led him to attribute meanings to the recomputation terms “subdivision,” “development,” and “construction” different from plaintiff’s meanings. Defendant offered this evidence to show that he did not have reason to know that the recomputation provision should have been understood to include “completed buildings.”</p>
<p id="035ca2a6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Based on the record before us, we determine that a reasonable lessee in defendant’s position would not have been reasonably induced to believe that he must complete all buildings by the recomputation provision deadline. Thus, the trial court properly found that defendant had no knowledge or reason to know plaintiff’s meaning that would allow plaintiff to prevail.</p>

<li class=""><p id="035ca2a8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Construction against drafter.</i> In the trial court’s second decision in the <i>Joyner</i> case (the one reversed by the above-reproduced appellate decision), the trial court broke the tie resulting from its finding that no “meeting of the minds” had occurred and found for plaintiff Joyner by invoking the principle that a contractual ambiguity should generally be resolved against the party who drafted the language in question (sometimes known as the maxim of interpretation <i>contra proferentem</i> — see item 5 in the Comment below). As the court indicates, this maxim is frequently employed in cases involving “adhesion contracts” but is by no means limited to such cases. See St. Charles Foods, Inc. v. America’s Favorite Chicken Co., 198 F.3d 815 (11th Cir. 1999) (letter agreement with franchisee that was ambiguous about right of first refusal construed against franchisor that drafted language); Guerrant v. Roth, 777 N.E.2d 499 (Ill. App. Ct. 2002) (ambiguity in contingency fee agreement written by attorney particularly subject to rule requiring construction against drafter). Does the appellate court adequately justify its refusal to apply this maxim in <i>Joyner</i>? Other courts have agreed that the maxim should be limited in its application to cases where one party can fairly be regarded as solely responsible for the language in question. Compare Western Sling &amp; Cable Co. v. Hamilton, 545 So. 2d 29, 32 (Ala. 1989) (“[w]here both parties to a contract are sophisticated business persons advised by counsel and the contract is a product of negotiations at arm’s length between the parties, . . . no reason to automatically construe ambiguities in the contract against the drafter”), with Speedway Motorsports Int’l Ltd. v. Bronwen Energy Trading, Ltd., 707 S.E.2d 385 (N.C. Ct. App. 2011) (sophisticated parties, but language chosen by one; maxim applied, citing <i>Joyner</i>). See generally Meredith R. Miller, Contract Law, Party Autonomy and the New Formalism, 75 Mo. L. Rev. 493 (2010) (suggesting caution in characterizing parties as “sophisticated,” to avoid exacerbating imbalances of bargaining power). Court decisions also emphasize that the rule should be used only when other means of <span title="405" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-405">p. 405</span>interpretation cannot resolve an ambiguity.

<p id="035ca2aa-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Over the years, courts have developed a number of principles of interpretation to aid them in giving meaning to expressions of contractual agreement. The following useful list was compiled by Professor Edwin Patterson:</p>

<p id="035ca2ab-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this brief treatment we can only quote a list of standard maxims, which may not be complete. The ones most often phrased in Latin are given first:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-decimal">
<li class=""><p id="035ca2ac-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Noscitur a sociis.</i> The meaning of a word in a series is affected by others in the same series; or, a word may be affected by its immediate context. The example for the next maxim may be taken to illustrate this one.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="035ca2ad-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Ejusdem generis.</i> A general term joined with a specific one will be deemed to include only things that are like (of the same genus as) the specific one. This one if applied usually leads to a restrictive interpretation. E.g., <i>S</i> contracts to sell <i>B</i> his farm together with the “cattle, hogs, and other animals.” This would probably not include <i>S</i>’s favorite house-dog, but might include a few sheep that <i>S</i> was raising for the market.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="035cc9be-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Expressio unius exclusio alterius.</i> If one or more specific items are listed, without any more general or inclusive terms, other items although similar in kind are excluded. E.g., <i>S</i> contracts to sell <i>B</i> his farm together with “the cattle and hogs on the farm.” This language would be interpreted to exclude the sheep and <i>S</i>’s favorite house-dog.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="035cc9bf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Ut magis valeat quam pereat.</i> By this maxim an interpretation that makes the contract valid is preferred to one that makes it invalid.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="035cc9c0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Omnia praesumuntur contra proferentem.</i> This maxim states that if a written contract contains a word or phrase which is capable of two reasonable meanings, one of which favors one party and the other of which favors the other, that interpretation will be preferred which is less favorable to the one by whom the contract was drafted. This maxim favors the party of lesser bargaining power, who has little or no opportunity to choose the terms of the contract, and perforce accepts one drawn by the stronger party. . . . However, the maxim is commonly invoked in cases that do not reveal any disparity of bargaining power between the parties.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="035cc9c1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Interpret contract as a whole.</i> A writing or writings that form part of the same transaction should be interpreted together as a whole, that is, every term should be interpreted as a part of the whole and not as if isolated from it. This maxim expresses the contextual theory of meaning, which is, perhaps, a truism.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="035cc9c2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>“Purpose of the parties.”</i> “The principal apparent purpose of the parties is given great weight in determining the meaning to be given to manifestations of intention or to any part thereof.” This maxim must be used with caution. In fact, the two parties to a (bargain) contract necessarily have different purposes, and if these are apparent, then the court can construe a principal or common purpose from the two as a guide to the interpretation of language or the filling of gaps. Thus a contract to sell, buy, and export scrap copper was construed <span title="406" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-406">p. 406</span>to make the buyer’s obtaining of an export license a condition of the seller’s promise to deliver. However, if the purposes of the parties are obscure the court may well fall back upon “plain meaning.”</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="035cc9c3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Specific provision is exception to a general one.</i> If two provisions of a contract are inconsistent with each other and if one is “general” enough to include the specific situation to which the other is confined, the specific provision will be deemed to qualify the more general one, that is, to state an exception to it. A lease of a truck-trailer provided that the lessee should be absolutely liable for loss or damage to the vehicle, yet another clause stated that no party’s liability should be increased by this contract. It was held that the former was more specific and therefore controlled the general provision, hence the lessee was liable. A careful draftsman would have stated the former as an exception to the latter, and the court in effect does it for him.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="035cc9c4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Handwritten or typed provisions control printed provisions.</i> Where a written contract contains both printed provisions and handwritten or typed provisions, and the two are inconsistent, the handwritten or typed provisions are preferred. This maxim is based on the inference that the language inserted by handwriting or by typewriter for this particular contract is a more recent and more reliable expression of their intentions than is the language of a printed form. While this maxim is used in interpreting insurance contracts and other contracts of adhesion, it is also applicable to all contracts drawn up on a printed form.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="035cc9c5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Public interest preferred.</i> If a public interest is affected by a contract, that interpretation or construction is preferred which favors the public interest. The proper scope of application of this rule seems doubtful. It may have some appropriate uses in construing contracts between private parties. However, as applied to government contracts it would, if applied, be used to save the taxpayers’ money as against those contracting with the government. But this is not, it is believed, a standard of interpretation or construction uniformly applied to government contracts.</p></li>

<p id="035cc9c8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Rational reading of terms.</i> One maxim omitted from Professor Patterson’s list is reflected in Restatement (Second) §203(a). The section provides that in interpreting an agreement, a court should prefer an interpretation that makes an agreement reasonable, lawful, and effective to one that produces an unreasonable or unlawful result or that renders the agreement ineffective. The Restatement gives the following example:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="035cc9c9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">1. <i>A</i> licenses <i>B</i> to manufacture pipes under <i>A</i>’s patents, and <i>B</i> agrees to pay “a royalty of 50 cents per 1,000 feet for an output of 5,000,000 or less feet per year, and for an output of over 5,000,000 per year at the rate of 30 cents per thousand feet.” The 50 cent rate is payable on the first 5,000,000 feet, the 30 cent <span title="407" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-407">p. 407</span>rate only on the excess. The more literal reading is unreasonable, since it would involve a smaller payment for 6,000,000 feet than for 4,000,000 feet.</p>
</div>
<p id="035cc9ca-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Restatement (Second) §203, Illustration 1. See also Fishman v. LaSalle Nat’l Bank, 247 F.3d 300 (1st Cir. 2001) (loan agreement term setting amount of prepayment premium would be interpreted to produce rational result rather than apply implausible meaning that would come from literal reading); Cadle Co. v. Vargas, 771 N.E.2d 179 (Mass. App. Ct. 2002) (loan guarantee agreement would not be interpreted to lead to absurd result; “common sense is as much a part of contract interpretation as . . . the arsenal of canons”). Judge Richard A. Posner has cited the <i>Fishman</i> case as an example of a judicial technique he calls the “Best Guess” rule, in which a court combines common sense and some practical knowledge of the ways of the business world to reach results that are both commercially efficient and generally within the realm of what either party could reasonably have expected the contract to mean. Richard A. Posner, The Law and Economics of Contract Interpretation, 83 Tex. L. Rev. 1581, 1603 (2005).</p>
<p id="035cc9cb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Supplying an omitted term.</i> The possibility exists that even after applying the array of interpretive principles, a court may conclude that the parties failed to agree upon a material term. Depending on the posture of the case, it may be appropriate for a court to conclude that the parties did not make an enforceable agreement. See Restatement (Second) §33, Comment <i>a.</i> In other cases, however, the evidence of intent to be bound or the degree of performance already rendered may cause rescission to be inappropriate. Restatement (Second) §204 recommends that in those situations the courts should supply a term that is reasonable under the circumstances. Professor Prince has addressed the topic of omitted terms and noted that gaps in the contract may result from lack of foresight, incomplete bargaining, or excessive initial optimism about performance of the contract. Harry G. Prince, Contract Interpretation in California: Plain Meaning, Parol Evidence and Use of the “Just Result” Principle, 31 Loy. L.A. L. Rev. 557, 619-620 (1998). Professor Prince argues that in such cases, courts should not strain to apply principles of interpretation to fill the gap, but should instead strive to achieve a just outcome:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="035cc9cc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A tremendously better approach would be to simply recognize that, in such cases of <i>lacunae</i> within the contract terms, the courts are empowered to weigh a number of equitable factors and attempt to reach a just result. Those equitable factors would include addressing public interests and public good, allowing for sharing of unanticipated losses and gains, avoiding the award of a windfall to one party at the cost of denying recovery to the other side, and considering the parties’ good or bad faith behavior.</p>

<p id="035cf0e4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issue is, what is chicken? Plaintiff says “chicken” means a young chicken, suitable for broiling and frying. Defendant says “chicken” means any bird of that genus that meets contract specifications on weight and quality, including what it calls “stewing chicken” and plaintiff pejoratively terms “fowl.” Dictionaries give both meanings, as well as some others not relevant here. To support its [interpretation], plaintiff sends a number of volleys over the net; defendant essays to return them and adds a few serves of its own. Assuming that both parties were acting in good faith, the case nicely illustrates Holmes’ remark “that the making of a contract depends not on the agreement of two minds in one intention, but on the agreement of two sets of external signs — not on the parties’ having <i>meant</i> the same thing but on their having <i>said</i> the same thing.” The Path of the Law, in Collected Legal Papers, p. 178.

The initial shipment under the first contract was short but the balance was shipped on May 17. When the initial shipment arrived in Switzerland, plaintiff found, on May 28, that the 2½-3 lbs. birds were not young chicken suitable for broiling and frying but stewing chicken or “fowl”; indeed, many of the cartons and bags plainly so indicated. Protests ensued. Nevertheless, shipment under the second contract was made on May 29, the 2½-3 lbs. birds again being stewing chicken. Defendant stopped the transportation of these at Rotterdam.</p>

This is unpersuasive — a contract for “apples” of two different sizes could be filled with different kinds of apples even though only one species come in both sizes. Defendant notes that the contract called not simply for chicken but for “U.S. Fresh Frozen Chicken, Grade A, Government Inspected.” It says the contract thereby incorporated by reference the Department of Agriculture’s regulations, which favor its interpretation; I shall return to this after reviewing plaintiff’s other contentions.</p>
<p id="035d17ff-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first hinges on an exchange of cablegrams which preceded execution of the formal contracts. The negotiations leading up to the contracts were conducted in New York between defendant’s secretary, Ernest R. Bauer, and a Mr. Stovicek, who was in New York for the Czechoslovak government at the World Trade Fair. A few days after meeting Bauer at the fair, Stovicek telephoned and inquired whether defendant would be interested in exporting poultry to Switzerland. Bauer then met with Stovicek, who showed him a cable from plaintiff dated April 26, 1957, announcing that they “are buyer” of 25,000 lbs. of chicken 2½-3 lbs. weight, Cryovac packed, grade A Government inspected, at a price up to 33¢ per pound, for shipment on May 10, to be confirmed by the following morning, and were interested in further offerings. After testing the market for price, Bauer accepted, and Stovicek sent a confirmation that evening. Plaintiff stresses that, although these and subsequent cables between plaintiff and defendant, which laid the basis for the additional quantities under the first and for all of the second contract, were predominantly in German, they used the English word “chicken”; it claims this was done because it understood “chicken” meant young chicken whereas the German word, “Huhn,” included both “Brathuhn” (broilers) and “Suppenhuhn” (stewing chicken), and that defendant, whose officers were thoroughly conversant with German, should have realized this. Whatever force this argument might otherwise have is largely drained away by Bauer’s testimony that he asked Stovicek what kind of chickens were wanted, received the answer “any kind of chickens,” and then, in German, asked whether the cable meant “Huhn” and received an affirmative response. . . . </p>
<p id="035d1800-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff’s next contention is that there was a definite trade usage that “chicken” meant “young chicken.” Defendant showed that it was only beginning in the poultry trade in 1957, thereby bringing itself within the principle that “when one of the parties is not a member of the trade or other circle, his acceptance of the standard must be made to appear” by proving either that he had actual knowledge of the usage or that the usage is “so generally known in the community that his actual individual knowledge of it may be inferred.” 9 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1940) §2464. Here there was no proof of actual <span title="410" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-410">p. 410</span>knowledge of the alleged usage; indeed, it is quite plain that defendant’s belief was to the contrary. In order to meet the alternative requirement, the law of New York demands a showing that “the usage is of so long continuance, so well established, so notorious, so universal and so reasonable in itself, as that the presumption is violent that the parties contracted with reference to it, and made it a part of their agreement.” Walls v. Bailey, 1872, 49 N.Y. 464, 472-473.</p>
<p id="035d1801-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff endeavored to establish such a usage by the testimony of three witnesses and certain other evidence. Strasser, resident buyer in New York for a large chain of Swiss cooperatives, testified that “on chicken I would definitely understand a broiler.” However, the force of this testimony was considerably weakened by the fact that in his own transactions the witness, a careful businessman, protected himself by using “broiler” when that was what he wanted and “fowl” when he wished older birds. Indeed, there are some indications, dating back to a remark of Lord Mansfield, Edie v. East India Co., 2 Burr. 1216, 1222 (1761), that no credit should be given “witnesses to usage, who could not adduce instances in verification.” 7 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1940), §1954; see McDonald v. Acker, Merrall &amp; Condit Co., 2d Dept. 1920, 192 App. Div. 123, 126, 182 N.Y.S. 607. While Wigmore thinks this goes too far, a witness’ consistent failure to rely on the alleged usage deprives his opinion testimony of much of its effect. Niesielowski, an officer of one of the companies that had furnished the stewing chicken to defendant, testified that “chicken” meant “the male species of the poultry industry. That could be a broiler, a fryer or a roaster,” but not a stewing chicken; however, he also testified that upon receiving defendant’s inquiry for “chickens,” he asked whether the desire was for “fowl or frying chickens” and, in fact, supplied fowl, although taking the precaution of asking defendant, a day or two after plaintiff’s acceptance of the contracts in suit, to change its confirmation of its order from “chickens,” as defendant had originally prepared it, to “stewing chickens.” Dates, an employee of Urner-Barry Company, which publishes a daily market report on the poultry trade, gave it as his view that the trade meaning of “chicken” was “broilers and fryers.” In addition to this opinion testimony, plaintiff relied on the fact that the Urner-Barry service, the Journal of Commerce, and Weinberg Bros. &amp; Co. of Chicago, a large supplier of poultry, published quotations in a manner which, in one way or another, distinguish between “chicken,” comprising broilers, fryers and certain other categories, and “fowl,” which, Bauer acknowledged, included stewing chickens. This material would be impressive if there were nothing to the contrary. However, there was, as will now be seen.</p>
<p id="035d1802-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant’s witness Weininger, who operates a chicken eviscerating plant in New Jersey, testified “Chicken is everything except a goose, a duck, and a turkey. Everything is a chicken, but then you have to say, you have to specify which category you want or that you are talking about.” Its witness Fox said that in the trade “chicken” would encompass all the various classifications. Sadina, who conducts a food inspection service, testified that he would consider any bird coming within the classes of “chicken” in the Department of Agriculture’s regulations to be a chicken. The specifications approved by the General Services Administration include fowl as well as broilers and fryers under the classification <span title="411" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-411">p. 411</span>“chickens.” Statistics of the Institute of American Poultry Industries use the phrases “Young chickens” and “Mature chickens,” under the general heading “Total chickens,” and the Department of Agriculture’s daily and weekly price reports avoid use of the word “chicken” without specification.</p>
<p id="035d1803-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant advances several other points which it claims affirmatively support its construction. Primary among these is the regulation of the Department of Agriculture, 7 C.F.R. §70.300-70.370, entitled, “Grading and Inspection of Poultry and Edible Products Thereof,” and in particular §70.301 which recited:</p>

</div>
<p id="035d3e1b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant argues, as previously noted, that the contract incorporated these regulations by reference. Plaintiff answers that the contract provision related simply to grade and Government inspection and did not incorporate the Government definition of “chicken,” and also that the definition in the Regulations is ignored in the trade. However, the latter contention was contradicted by Weininger and Sadina; and there is force in defendant’s argument that the contract made the regulations a dictionary, particularly since the reference to Government grading was already in plaintiff’s initial cable to Stovicek.</p>
<p id="035d3e1c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant makes a further argument based on the impossibility of its obtaining broilers and fryers at the 33¢ price offered by plaintiff for the 2½-3 lbs. birds. There is no substantial dispute that, in late April, 1957, the price for 2½-3 lbs. broilers was between 35 and 37¢ per pound, and that when defendant entered into the contracts, it was well aware of this and intended to fill them, by supplying fowl in these weights. It claims that plaintiff must likewise have known the market since plaintiff had reserved shipping space on April 23, three days before plaintiff’s cable to Stovicek, or, at least, that Stovicek was chargeable with such knowledge. It is scarcely an answer to say, as plaintiff does in its brief, that the 33¢ price offered by the 2½-3 lbs. “chickens” was closer to the prevailing 35¢ price for broilers than to the 30¢ at which defendant procured fowl. Plaintiff must have expected defendant to make some profit — certainly it could not have expected defendant deliberately to incur a loss.</p>
<p id="035d3e1d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, defendant relies on conduct by the plaintiff after the first shipment had been received. On May 28 plaintiff sent two cables complaining that the larger birds in the first shipment constituted “fowl.” Defendant answered with a cable refusing to recognize plaintiff’s objection and announcing “We have today ready for shipment 50,000 lbs. chicken 2½-3 lbs. 25,000 lbs. broilers 1½-2 lbs.,” these being the goods procured for shipment under the second contract, and asked immediate answer “whether we are to ship this merchandise to you and whether you will accept the merchandise.” After several other cable exchanges, plaintiff replied on May 29 “Confirm again that merchandise is to be shipped <span title="412" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-412">p. 412</span>since resold by us if not enough pursuant to contract chickens are shipped the missing quantity is to be shipped within ten days stop we resold to our customers pursuant to your contract chickens grade A you have to deliver us said merchandise we again state that we shall make you fully responsible for all resulting costs.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10352_2c3aa385-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10352_2c3aa385-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">2</a></span> Defendant argues that if plaintiff was sincere in thinking it was entitled to young chickens, plaintiff would not have allowed the shipment under the second contract to go forward, since the distinction between broilers and chickens drawn in defendant’s cablegram must have made it clear that the larger birds would not be broilers. However, plaintiff answers that the cables show plaintiff was insisting on delivery of young chickens and that defendant shipped old ones at its peril. Defendant’s point would be highly relevant on another disputed issue — whether if liability were established, the measure of damages should be the difference in market value of broilers and stewing chicken in New York or the larger difference in Europe, but I cannot give it weight on the issue of interpretation. Defendant points out also that plaintiff proceeded to deliver some of the larger birds in Europe, describing them as “poulets”; defendant argues that it was only when plaintiff’s customers complained about this that plaintiff developed the idea that “chicken” meant “young chicken.” There is little force in this in view of plaintiff’s immediate and consistent protests.</p>
<p id="035d3e1f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When all the evidence is reviewed, it is clear that defendant believed it could comply with the contracts by delivering stewing chicken in the 2½-3 lbs. size. Defendant’s subjective intent would not be significant if this did not coincide with an objective meaning of “chicken.” Here it did coincide with one of the dictionary meanings, with the definition in the Department of Agriculture Regulations to which the contract made at least oblique reference, with at least some usage in the trade, with the realities of the market, and with what plaintiff’s spokesman had said. Plaintiff asserts it to be equally plain that plaintiff’s own subjective intent was to obtain broilers and fryers; the only evidence against this is the material as to market prices and this may not have been sufficiently brought home. In any event it is unnecessary to determine that issue. For plaintiff has the burden of showing that “chicken” was used in the narrower rather than in the broader sense, and this it has not sustained.</p>

<li class=""><p id="035d3e23-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Whose meaning prevails?</i>  Joyner illustrated the application of the principles of the modified objective theory of contract interpretation: A party is bound by the other party’s meaning if the first party either knew or had reason to know of the second party’s meaning while the second party did not know or <span title="413" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-413">p. 413</span>have reason to know of the first party’s interpretation. Consider the effect of these principles in <i>Frigaliment.</i> Does the court hold that a contract was formed and that the word <i>chicken</i> is to be interpreted in accordance with the defendant’s meaning, or does the court hold that no contract was formed because there was no reasonable basis for choosing between the conflicting meanings of the word <i>chicken?</i> Does it make any difference to the result in the case? Would the choice between these theories have made a difference if Frigaliment had refused to accept the “chickens” and B.N.S. had brought suit for breach of contract?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="035d3e24-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Ambiguity and “plain meaning.”</i> More extensively than <i>Joyner, Frigaliment</i> examines the various types of evidence that each party can introduce to convince the trier of fact that its meaning should prevail. Before proceeding to an examination of the circumstances surrounding the making of the contract, the court notes that the word <i>chicken</i> is ambiguous. Is it necessary for a court to make a preliminary determination that the contract is ambiguous before receiving evidence of surrounding circumstances? Courts often state that the “plain meaning” of the language of a contract should govern and that extrinsic evidence is admissible only if the court concludes that the contract is ambiguous. E.g., Abdelrhman v. Ackerman, 76 A.3d 883 (D.C. 2013) (plain meaning rule required exclusion of extrinsic evidence where tenant agreed in writing that new purchaser of building would have option to terminate his lease, even though inclusion of that term was inexplicable in light of parties’ negotiating history).</p>
<p id="035d6535-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Contract scholars (including both objectivists and advocates of a more flexible, modern approach to interpretation) have consistently rejected the idea that words can have only one precise meaning. As Holmes said, “It is not true that in practice (and I know no reason why theory should disagree with the facts) a given word or even a given collocation of words has one meaning and no other. A word generally has several meanings, even in a dictionary.” Oliver Wendell Holmes, The Theory of Legal Interpretation, 12 Harv. L. Rev. 417 (1899). Professor Corbin argued that a court should admit all relevant evidence in order to determine the intention of the parties, including evidence of subjective intent. 3 Corbin on Contracts §538 (1960), at 73. See also Margaret N. Kniffin, 5 Corbin on Contracts §24.7 (Joseph M. Perillo ed., 1998). The Restatement adopts Corbin’s view on the admissibility of extrinsic evidence. Restatement (Second) §202.</p>
<p id="035d6536-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although contract theorists have been practically unanimous in their rejection of the plain meaning rule, many (perhaps most) courts will nonetheless rely on the rule and refuse to receive extrinsic evidence of meaning unless the court first concludes that the agreement is ambiguous. Joseph M. Perillo, Contracts §3-10, at 136-137 (7th ed. 2014).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="035d6537-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Patent and latent ambiguity.</i> Assuming a court requires the contract to be ambiguous before admitting extrinsic evidence, when is an agreement ambiguous? Courts and scholars have identified two types of ambiguity: patent or intrinsic ambiguity and latent or extrinsic ambiguity. In Bohler-Uddeholm Am., Inc. v. Ellwood Group, Inc., 247 F.3d 79 (3d Cir. 2001), the defendant <span title="414" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-414">p. 414</span>appealed after a jury returned a verdict against it for $4.1 million, asserting that the contract had a plain meaning that favored its position and that the trial court had erred in admitting extrinsic evidence to uncover a latent ambiguity. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals, faced with apparently conflicting Pennsylvania precedents, first noted that the state’s courts have often held that where a written contract is facially clear a court should not look for its meaning beyond its “four corners.” Nevertheless, Pennsylvania decisions also permit the court to receive and consider extrinsic evidence to determine whether there may be in the agreement a “latent ambiguity,” one not apparent from the words alone (at least in their common meanings) but visible in the light of surrounding circumstances. Such evidence should consist of more than the parties’ own declarations of their “intentions” at the time of contracting, however, and it should not seek to impose on the writing a meaning beyond any reasonable understanding of its terms. The cases thus resolve the apparent tension between “plain meaning” and “latent ambiguity” analyses, the court concluded,</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="035d6538-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . by allowing only extrinsic evidence of a certain nature to establish latent ambiguity in a contract; a court should determine whether the type of extrinsic evidence offered could be used to support a reasonable alternative interpretation under the precepts of Pennsylvania law on contract interpretation. . . . Once the court determines that a party has offered extrinsic evidence capable of establishing latent ambiguity, a decision as to which of the competing interpretations of the contract is the correct one is reserved for the factfinder, who would examine the content of the extrinsic evidence (along with all the other evidence) in order to make this determination. . . . </p>

<p id="035d653a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a similar approach, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has made a distinction between objective and subjective extrinsic evidence. <i>Objective evidence</i>, testimony of disinterested third parties or trade usage or the like, is deemed permissible to establish latent ambiguity because such evidence cannot be easily fabricated. <i>Subjective evidence</i>, testimony about what the parties believed the contract meant, is not acceptable for that purpose because it tends to be self-serving. AM International, Inc. v. Graphic Mgmt. Associates, Inc., 44 F.3d 572, 574-576 (7th Cir. 1995). Would you classify the term “chicken” as involving patent or latent ambiguity? If the <i>Frigaliment</i> court had applied the Pennsylvania approach, would extrinsic evidence of the meaning of the word “chicken” have been admitted? Why?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="035d653b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Effect of relevant statute.</i> What effect does the court give to the Department of Agriculture regulation defining the classes of chickens? The modern view is that definitions of terms contained in statutes or administrative regulations are not determinative of the meaning of such terms in contracts. Restatement (Second) §201, Comment <i>c</i>; Margaret N. Kniffin, 5 Corbin on Contracts §24.26 (Joseph M. Perillo ed., 1998). E.g., Bull Motor Co. <span title="415" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-415">p. 415</span>v. Murphy, 270 S.W.3d 350 (Ark. Ct. App. 2008) (where car purchased as “new” had been previously driven 40 miles by a thief, question whether car was “new” as provided by contract was not governed by statutory definition of “new” vehicle). What is the justification for this approach?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="035d653c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Relevance of trade usage.</i> The plaintiff buyer in <i>Frigaliment</i> attempted to show the existence of a trade usage by which the term “chicken” would be understood to mean a young chicken. While ultimately rejecting that contention as not sufficiently established by the testimony of the plaintiff’s witnesses, the court appears to have regarded evidence of this type as admissible and relevant to the disputed issue of interpretation. Indeed, the existence of a relevant trade usage can overcome even the apparently unambiguous, “plain meaning” of contract language. See Galardi v. Naples Polaris, LLC, 301 P.3d 364, 367 (Nev. 2013) (modern view is that trade usage can be used both to interpret an ambiguous term and “also to determine whether a contract provision is ambiguous in the first place,” citing Restatement (Second) §220, Comment <i>d</i>). But cf. White City Shopping Ctr., LP, v. PR Restaurants, LLC, 2006 WL 3292641 (Mass. Super. Ct.) (holding that shopping center lease precluding landlord from renting space to new tenants who would sell “sandwiches” did not apply to sale of “burritos” because “sandwich” is unambiguous and not commonly understood to include burritos, notwithstanding any commercial definition to contrary). For a skeptical view of the <i>White City</i> decision, see Marjorie Florestal, Is a Burrito a Sandwich? Exploring Race, Class and Culture in Contracts, 14 Mich. J. Race &amp; L. 1 (2008).</p>
<p id="035d653d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In §1-303, the Uniform Commercial Code defines “usage of trade” and generally provides that evidence of trade usage should be relevant to the interpretation of the parties’ agreement. Section 1-303 also defines two other concepts relevant to issues of interpretation: “course of performance” (actions of the parties in carrying out the contract at issue) and “course of dealing” (actions taken by the parties in performing previous contracts between them). (“Course of performance” is also defined in §2-208; prior to the revision of Article 1, “usage of trade” and “course of dealing” were defined in §1-205.) Of course, under the Code (as in <i>Frigaliment,</i> decided under the common law) the court may receive evidence of an asserted trade usage and yet ultimately find that the contended usage has not been sufficiently established as a fact. E.g., Williams v. Curtin, 807 F.2d 1046 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (evidence failed to establish trade usage that “slaw cabbage” referred to cabbage of a certain minimum size). Later in this chapter we examine more closely the role of trade usage and related concepts under the UCC, particularly in light of the Code’s version of the parol evidence rule (§2-202).</p></li>

Professor Bernstein has drawn a distinction between cases in which the parties wish to preserve their relationship and “end game” situations in which the relationship has collapsed and the parties are attempting to maximize their gains or minimize their losses. She argues that norms such as trade usage, course of dealing, and course of performance are relationship preserving, but <span title="416" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-416">p. 416</span>parties to a dispute do not usually want a dispute-resolution body to apply these norms, preferring that relationship-preserving norms be left to the nonlegal realm.

Those policies are in evidence. Prior policies apparently were first purchased in 1968. The agent, who had power to bind insurance coverage for defendant, was told plaintiff would be handling farm chemicals. After inspecting the building then used by plaintiff for storage he made certain suggestions regarding security. There ensued a conversation in which he pointed out there had to be visible evidence of burglary. There was no testimony by anyone that plaintiff was then or thereafter informed the policy to be delivered would define burglary to require “visible marks made by tools, explosives, electricity or chemicals upon, or physical damage to, the exterior of the premises at the place of . . . entry.”</p>

From what the agent saw (tire tracks and marks on the interior of the building) and his contacts with the investigating officers “. . . the thought didn’t enter my mind that it wasn’t covered. . . .” From the trial testimony it was obvious the only understanding was that there should be some hard evidence of a third-party burglary vis-à-vis an “inside job.” The latter was in this instance effectively ruled out when the thief was required to break an interior door lock to gain access to the chemicals.</p>
<p id="035db371-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The agent testified the insurance was purchased and “the policy was sent out afterwards.” The president of plaintiff corporation, a 37-year-old farmer with a high school education, looked at that portion of the policy setting out coverages, including coverage for burglary loss, the amounts of insurance, and <span title="418" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-418">p. 418</span>the “location and description.” He could not recall reading the fine print defining “burglary” on page three of the policy. . . . </p>

Moreover, although statutory and administrative regulations have made increasing inroads on the insurer’s autonomy by prescribing some kinds of provisions and proscribing others, most insurance policy provisions are still drafted by insurers. Regulation is relatively weak in most instances, and even the provisions prescribed or approved by legislative or administrative action ordinarily are in essence adoptions, outright or slightly modified, of proposals made by insurers’ draftsmen.</p>

<p id="035e01a7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The answer, I suggest, is this: Instead of thinking about “assent” to boiler-plate clauses, we can recognize that so far as concerns the specific, there is no assent at all. What has in fact been assented to, specifically, are the few dickered terms, and the broad type of transaction, and but one thing more. That one thing more is a blanket assent (not a specific assent) to any not unreasonable or indecent terms the seller may have on his form, which do not alter or eviscerate the reasonable meaning of the dickered terms. The fine print which has not been read has no business to cut under the reasonable meaning of those dickered terms which constitute the dominant and only real expression of agreement, but much of it commonly belongs in.

<p id="035e01b1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although customers typically adhere to standardized agreements and are bound by them without even appearing to know the standard terms in detail, they are not bound to unknown terms which are beyond the range of reasonable expectation. A debtor who delivers a check to his creditor with the amount blank does not authorize the insertion of an infinite figure. Similarly, a party who adheres to the other party’s standard terms does not assent to a term if the other party has reason to believe that the adhering party would not have accepted the agreement if he had known that the agreement contained the particular term. Such a belief or assumption may be shown by the prior negotiations or inferred from the circumstances. Reason to believe may be inferred from the fact that the term is bizarre or oppressive, from the fact that it eviscerates the non-standard terms explicitly agreed to, or from the fact that it eliminates the dominant purpose of the transaction. The inference is reinforced if the adhering party never had an opportunity to read the term, or if it is illegible or otherwise hidden from view. This rule is closely related to the policy against unconscionable terms and the rule of interpretation against the draftsman.</p>

Except for larger type on the face sheet and black (but not larger) print to designate divisions and sub-headings, the entire policies are of one size and style of print. To compare the <i>face</i> sheet with the body of the policy is like comparing a book’s jacket cover with the narrative content; and the use of black type or other means of emphasis to separate one part of an instrument from another is an approved editorial expedient which serves to <i>assist,</i> not <i>hinder,</i> readability.

Does the court in <i>C &amp; J Fertilizer</i> adequately justify its determination that the “reasonable expectations” of the insured included coverage on the facts of that case? In Atwater Creamery Co. v. Western Nat’l Mut. Ins. Co., 366 N.W.2d 271 (Minn. 1985), the insured sought a declaratory judgment that the loss from a burglary from its chemical storage building was covered by its policy with the defendant, despite the absence of visible marks of physical damage to the exterior of the plaintiff’s building. The policy language on this point was identical to that employed in the <i>C &amp; J Fertilizer</i> case, and the Minnesota Supreme Court upheld a trial court determination that the doctrine of reasonable expectations applied to permit recovery on the policy. Investigators including local, county, and state police personnel had determined that none of the plaintiff’s employees were involved in the burglary. Calling this definition of “burglary” a “classic example of a policy provision that should be, and has been, interpreted according to the reasonable expectations of the insured” (id. at 277), the appellate court went on to observe as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="035e7701-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> There are, of course, fidelity bonds which cover employee theft. The creamery had such a policy covering director and manager theft. The fidelity company, however, does not undertake to insure against the risk of third-party burglaries. A business that requests and purchases burglary insurance reasonably is seeking coverage for loss from third-party burglaries whether a break-in is accomplished by an inept burglar or by a highly skilled burglar. . . . [Plaintiff] could reasonably have expected the burglary policy to cover this burglary where the police, as well as the trial court, found that it was an “outside job.”</p>

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="035e7704-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The objectively reasonable expectations of applicants and intended beneficiaries regarding the terms of insurance contracts will be honored even though painstaking study of the policy provisions would have negated those expectations.</p>

In its strongest form, the doctrine may involve the court’s refusing to apply an exclusion unambiguously stated in the policy or negating some other clearly phrased term.</p>
<p id="035e7706-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, many jurisdictions substantially limit the reasonable expectations doctrine by requiring the presence of ambiguity or a hidden or inconspicuous term, or have otherwise displayed a reluctance to adopt it as a broad rule. See Arthur J. Park, What to Reasonably Expect in the Coming Years From the Reasonable Expectations of the Insured Doctrine, 49 Willamette L. Rev. 165 (2012) (noting a number of variations of the doctrine and that many states require an ambiguity or hidden term before it will apply).</p>
<p id="035e7707-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some courts resist application of the doctrine even in modified form. The Florida Supreme Court declined to adopt the reasonable expectations doctrine in a case involving a question whether ammonia fumes came within an exclusion from insurance coverage for harm resulting from “escape of pollutants.” Deni Associates of Florida, Inc. v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 711 So. 2d 1135 (Fla. 1998). After noting that some jurisdictions apply the reasonable expectations doctrine only when the contract term is ambiguous and other courts apply the doctrine even when the meaning of the term is clear and unambiguous, the Florida court declined to apply the concept in either situation. The court stated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="035e7708-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We decline to adopt the doctrine of reasonable expectations.

Professor <span title="426" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-426">p. 426</span>Roger Henderson notes, however, that §211 is narrower than a full-fledged version of the doctrine of reasonable expectations:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="035e9e1c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The “black letter” formulation of the Restatement reflects the American Law Institute’s conservative approach in its recognition of an exception to the rule that standardized agreements will be enforced as written. The exception was narrowly drawn so as to assess the situation from the drafter’s perspective: “Where the other party has reason to believe that the party manifesting such assent would not do so if he knew that the writing contained a particular term, the term is not part of the agreement.” Only where a party has “reason to believe” that the other party, one who understands that a typical form contract is being used, would not have assented to a particular term is that term to be ignored. . . . [A]pplication of the exception requires taking the perspective of the insurer. As it is almost always the insured who will want to avoid a term of the policy or form contract, the decision maker asked to apply the exception must focus on information that was available to the insurer, i.e., what the insurer had reason to believe. If adhered to faithfully, this approach could disclose a significantly different “reasonable belief” from that derived by application of the Keeton formulation — the objectively determinable reasonable expectations of the insured.</p>

<li class=""><p id="035e9e1e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Defining “adhesion contract.”</i> Although developed in the case law as a doctrine relating specifically to insurance contracts, the doctrine of reasonable expectations appears potentially applicable to adhesion contracts generally. The Restatement formulation, although it narrows the doctrine by focusing on the expectations of the drafter, broadens the principle to cover all standardized contracts, not just insurance agreements. The court in <i>C &amp; J Fertilizer</i> cites and quotes from a number of the leading articles discussing contracts of adhesion, including Professor Kessler’s classic 1943 essay. Attempts to define the adhesion contract usually include references to the employment of a standardized form and some degree of imbalance of bargaining power, involving a “take-it-or-leave-it” approach, that is to say: “a standardized contract, which, imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength, relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.” Neal v. State Farm Ins. Cos., 10 Cal. Rptr. 781, 784 (Ct. App. 1961) (Tobriner, J.).</p>
<p id="035e9e1f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professor Todd Rakoff offered a similar analysis of what constitutes a contract of adhesion, but also noted that the contracts normally involve a drafting party who participates in numerous such transactions, while the adhering party enters into few of them, and that the adhering party’s principal obligation is usually the payment of money. Todd D. Rakoff, Contracts of <span title="427" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-427">p. 427</span>Adhesion: An Essay in Reconstruction, 96 Harv. L. Rev. 1173, 1176-1177 (1983). Professor Rakoff argued that underlying the issue of enforceability of contracts of adhesion is the allocation of power and freedom between commercial organizations and individuals. Viewed from this perspective, Rakoff concluded that contracts of adhesion should be presumptively unenforceable. Rakoff went on to propose a specific framework by which judges could implement the general principles he advocated, including imposition of the burden of proof on the drafter of an adhesion contract to show the reasonableness of the provision in question.

<li class=""><p id="035e9e20-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Relationship to unconscionability doctrine.</i> As we shall see in Chapter 7, the employment of standardized forms and the absence of bargaining over terms may also be the first step toward application of the doctrine of unconscionability. Unconscionability goes beyond interpretation, however, and involves either judicial invalidation of provisions of a written contract or imposition of terms different from those stated in the contract, without requiring ambiguity or departure from reasonable expectations.</p></li>

<p id="035e9e23-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We saw in Chapter 2 that from a very early time the common law established a link between the enforceability of a promise and compliance by the promisor with certain formalities when the promise was made. (Recall the action of covenant, which was used to enforce written promises made under seal.) Over time the seal has declined in importance, but contract law continues in a number of ways to attach significance to the execution of an agreement in writing. One of these is the preference for agreement expressed in a formal writing, over various other modes of expression, both oral and written. This preference is implemented by a rule of contract law commonly referred to as the “parol evidence rule.” (Note: <i>parol</i>, not <i>parole</i>, which is a different legal term.) As use of the word “parol” suggests, this rule is usually thought of as involving the admissibility of evidence of oral agreements, but it may apply as well to various types of written evidence.</p>
<p id="035e9e24-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unless the parties to a legal dispute are able to reduce their differences to ones solely of law rather than fact, resolution of that dispute by the litigation process will require a trial on the merits, at which the disputed issues of fact can be considered and decided by the trier of fact (which may be a jury or a judge). In the course of that trial, the parties are likely to offer a wide variety of evidence on those issues. Some of this evidence will be in the form of oral testimony by persons who have firsthand knowledge of the facts at issue, while some of it will be evidence in written form — letters or memoranda, perhaps, or business records. Under the rules of evidence commonly applied in American courts, any evidence to be prima facie admissible into court must be “relevant” — rationally probative of some fact material to the parties’ dispute. (Thus, in a contract dispute, the plaintiff’s testimony that she had a conversation with the defendant in which they mutually agreed to an exchange of <span title="428" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-428">p. 428</span>performances would ordinarily be relevant and admissible in a case where the plaintiff sought to enforce that agreement while the defendant denied making it.) Relevant evidence may, however, be excluded by some other rule of evidence based on the likelihood that evidence of a given type will be misleading or otherwise untrustworthy. The rules of evidence are of considerable theoretical difficulty and immense practical importance, and even a nodding acquaintance with them involves considerable study, as you will probably discover later in your law school career.</p>
<p id="035e9e25-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite its commonly employed appellation, the “parol evidence rule” is considered by authorities on evidence and contracts alike to be not a rule of evidence, but a rule of “substantive” law. E. Allan Farnsworth, Contracts §7.2 (4th ed. 2004). This distinction is for our purposes not very important, although it does have some practical consequences. For example, under ordinary rules of evidence, the right to object to inadmissible evidence is lost if not asserted at the time when the evidence is offered. This is not necessarily the case with evidence admitted in violation of the parol evidence rule, however. See Estate of Parker v. Dorchak, 673 So. 2d 1379 (Miss. 1996) (since parol evidence rule is matter of substantive law, evidence admitted in violation of that rule, even though without objection, should be disregarded if objection is made before case is submitted to trier of fact).</p>
<p id="035e9e26-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The parol evidence rule can be found in various sources, and the wordings may differ somewhat. E.g., Restatement (Second) of Contracts §§209-218; Uniform Commercial Code §2-202. The gist of it can be stated thus: When the parties to a contract have mutually agreed to incorporate (or “integrate”) a final version of their entire agreement in a writing, neither party will be permitted to contradict or supplement that written agreement with “extrinsic” evidence (written or oral) of prior agreements or negotiations between them. When the writing is intended to be final only with respect to a part of their agreement, the writing may not be contradicted, but it may be supplemented by such extrinsic evidence. Excellent discussions of the parol evidence rule can be found in E. Allan Farnsworth, Contracts §§7.2-7.6 (4th ed. 2004), and in Joseph M. Perillo, Contracts §§3.2-3.8 (7th ed. 2014). An interesting account of the historical origins of the rule, as well as a provocative exploration of its implications for present-day contract law, can be found in Hila Keren, Textual Harassment: A New Historicist Reappraisal of the Parol Evidence Rule with Gender in Mind, 13 Am. U. J. Gender Soc. Pol’y &amp; L. 251 (2005).</p>
<p id="035ec537-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In order to understand the working of the parol evidence rule, it is necessary first to apprehend its basic function: The rule does not define what evidence is affirmatively admissible, it only operates to <i>exclude</i> evidence — evidence that would otherwise be admissible as rationally probative of some fact at issue. If the parol evidence rule applies at all in a given situation, it has the effect of preventing one party from introducing into court extrinsic (or “collateral”) evidence of matters not contained in the written agreement between the parties (hence, “extrinsic” to it), where that evidence is offered to supplement or contradict the written agreement.</p>
<p id="035ec538-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To begin our examination of the parol evidence rule in action, let us first envision the procedural setting in which a parol evidence issue arises. Suppose <span title="429" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-429">p. 429</span>the owner of an apartment building enters into a written contract with a painting contractor calling for the painting of the “interior of the building, including walls, ceilings, and trim.” Later, a dispute develops about whether the contract requires the contractor to paint the common areas (hallways, etc.). When the parties are unable to resolve the dispute through negotiation, the owner discharges the contractor, who then brings suit against the owner claiming that the discharge constitutes a breach of contract. At trial the contractor offers to introduce evidence (either oral testimony or correspondence) that the owner was informed (at or before the time of contracting) that the contractor’s bid for the work did not include common areas, and the owner agreed to that. The owner objects to such evidence being considered by the fact finder because of the parol evidence rule. If the matter were being tried before a jury, the judge would hold an “in camera” hearing, that is, out of the presence of the jury, in which the party offering parol evidence would outline what the evidence would show, both parties would make legal arguments about the application of the parol evidence rule, and the judge would decide if the evidence were admissible under the rule. (Such in camera hearings are not unique to contract law; they are employed whenever evidence of doubtful admissibility is being offered by one of the parties. Another common example is the determination of the admissibility of an alleged confession by a defendant in a criminal case.) If the matter were being tried by a judge sitting without a jury, the in camera hearing would be unnecessary, but the judge would still be required to rule on the admissibility of the evidence.</p>
<p id="035ec539-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We will see that both courts and commentators differ widely over the scope and application of the parol evidence rule. The following case illustrates the classical approach.</p>

This raises the only point in the case.</p>
<p id="035eec55-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No ground was laid for the reformation of the written contract, and any charge of fraud on part of plaintiff or his agent in making the sale was on the trial expressly disclaimed. No rule is more familiar than that “parol contemporaneous evidence is inadmissible to contradict or vary the terms of a valid written instrument,” and yet none has given rise to more misapprehension as to its application. It is a rule founded on the obvious inconvenience and injustice that would result if matters in writing, made with consideration and deliberation, and intended to embody the entire agreement of the parties, were liable to be controlled by what Lord Coke expressively calls “the uncertain testimony of slippery memory.” Hence, where the parties have deliberately put their engagements into writing in such terms as to import a legal obligation, without any uncertainty as to the object or extent of such engagement, it is conclusively presumed that the whole engagement of the parties, and the manner and extent of their undertaking, was reduced to writing. 1 Greenl. Ev. §275. Of course, the rule presupposes that the parties intended to have the terms of their complete agreement embraced in the writing, and hence it does not apply where the writing is incomplete on its face and does not purport to contain the whole agreement, as in the case of mere bills of parcels, and the like.</p>
<p id="035eec56-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But in what manner shall it be ascertained whether the parties intended to express the whole of their agreement in writing? It is sometimes loosely stated that where the whole contract be not reduced to writing, parol evidence may be admitted to prove the part omitted. But to allow a party to lay the foundation for such parol evidence by oral testimony that only part of the agreement was reduced to writing, and then prove by parol the part omitted, would be to work in a circle, and to permit the very evil which the rule was designed to prevent. The only criterion of the completeness of the written contract as a full expression of the agreement of the parties is the writing itself. If it imports on its face to be a complete expression of the whole agreement, — that is, contains such language as imports a complete legal obligation, — it is to be presumed that the parties have introduced into it every material item and term; and parol evidence cannot be admitted to add another term to the agreement, although the writing contains nothing on the particular one to which the parol evidence is directed. The rule forbids to add by parol where the writing is silent, as well as to vary where it speaks, — 2 Phil. Evidence, (Cow. &amp; H. Notes,) 669; Naumberg v. Young, 44 N.J. Law, 331; Hei v. Heller, 53 Wis. 415, — and the law controlling the operation of a written contract becomes a part of it, and cannot be varied by parol any more than what is written. 2 Phil. Ev. (Cow. &amp; H.

There is nothing on its face (and this is a question of law for the court) to indicate that it is a mere informal and incomplete memorandum. Parol evidence of extrinsic facts and circumstances would, if necessary, be admissible, as it always is, to apply the contract to its subject-matter, or in order to a more perfect understanding of its language. But in that case such evidence is used, not to contradict or vary the written instrument, but to aid, uphold, and enforce it as it stands. The language of this contract “imports a legal obligation, without any uncertainty as to its object or the extent of the engagement,” and therefore “it must be conclusively presumed that the whole engagement of the parties, and the manner and extent of the undertaking, was reduced to writing.” No new term, forming a mere incident to or part of the contract of sale, can be added by parol. . . . </p>
<p id="035eec58-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . [W]e are referred to a few cases which seem to hold that parol evidence of a warranty is admissible on the ground that a warranty is collateral to the contract of sale, and that the rule does not exclude parol evidence of matters collateral to the subject of the written agreement. It seems to us that this is based upon a misapprehension as to the sense in which the term “collateral” is used in the rule invoked. There are a great many matters that, in a general sense, may be considered collateral to the contract; for example, in the case of leases, covenants for repairs, improvements, payment of taxes, etc., are, in a sense, collateral to a demise of the premises. But parol evidence of these would not be admissible to add to the terms of a written lease. So, in a sense, a warranty is collateral to a contract of sale, for the title would pass without a warranty. It is also collateral in the sense that its breach is no ground for a rescission of the contract by the vendor [<i>sic</i>; vendee?], but that he must resort to his action on the warranty for damages. But, when made, a warranty is a part of the contract of sale. The common sense of men would say, and correctly so, that when, on a sale of personal property, a warranty is given, it is one of the terms of the sale, and not a separate and independent contract. To justify the admission of a parol promise by one of the parties to a written contract, on the ground that it is collateral, the promise must relate to a subject distinct from that to which the writing relates. Dutton v. Gerrish, 9 Cush. 89; Naumberg v. Young, supra; 2 Taylor, Ev. §1038. See Lindley v. Lacey, 34 Law J., C. P., 7.</p>
<p id="035eec59-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have carefully examined all the cases cited in the quite exhaustive brief of counsel for defendant, and find but very few that are at all in conflict with the views already expressed, and these few do not commend themselves to our judgment.

<li class=""><p id="035eec5c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Rationale for parol evidence rule.</i> The court states that the parol evidence rule is “founded on the obvious inconvenience and injustice” that would result if extrinsic evidence were admissible to contradict or vary the terms of a written agreement. What specific “inconvenience” and “injustice” can result from the introduction of extrinsic evidence?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="035f136d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Meaning of “integration.”</i> As the <i>Thompson</i> court indicates, at the core of the parol evidence rule is the concept that parties typically arrive at contract terms through a process of preliminary negotiations and then produce a writing containing the final terms that have been mutually adopted. (As you are well aware, however, adhesion contracts do not fit this pattern.) The final writing is then considered the best evidence of the contract and displaces any earlier agreement or proposals, whether oral or written. See E. Allan Farnsworth, Contracts §7.2, at 418 (4th ed. 2004) (the useful function of the parol evidence rule is to replace negotiations and superseded understandings with a final authoritative statement of the agreement). Both classical and modern contract law use the term <i>complete integration</i> to refer to a writing that is intended to be a final and exclusive expression of the agreement of the parties. First Restatement §228; Restatement (Second) §210. Both classical and modern contract law also recognize the possibility of a <i>partial integration,</i> a writing that is intended to be final but not complete because it deals with some but not all aspects of a transaction between the parties. The correct application of the parol evidence rule thus requires that the court first determine whether the writing in question is intended to be a final expression of the parties agreement and, if so, whether it is a complete or partial statement of the contract terms. How would you assess the writing in <i>Thompson</i> in light of these standards?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="035f136e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Determining integration.</i> The <i>Thompson</i> court states that the written contract does not appear on its face to be either an “informal or incomplete” memorandum, and therefore the court concludes that the writing is a completely integrated agreement. The court’s determination is based on an approach often identified with Professor Williston, who argued that the question of integration must be determined from the “four corners” of the writing without resort to extrinsic evidence. 4 Williston on Contracts §633, at 1015. Moreover, Williston asserted that the inclusion in the writing of a “merger clause” would conclusively establish that the writing was integrated. Id. at 1014. A merger clause states that the writing is intended to be final and complete; all prior understandings are deemed to have been “merged” into or superseded by the final writing. The following is an example of a typical merger clause:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="035f136f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Entire Agreement.</i> This document constitutes the entire agreement of the parties and there are no representations, warranties, or agreements other than those contained in this document.</p>

<p id="035f1370-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A substantial number of jurisdictions still generally adhere to the “four corners” approach to determining integration and accord conclusive or nearly conclusive weight to the presence of a merger clause. See, e.g., RBS Citizens Bank, N.A. v. Purther, 22 F. Supp. 3d 747 (E.D. Mich. 2014) (under Michigan law, written integration clause is conclusive evidence that the parties intended the document to be the final and complete expression of their agreement unless agreement is obviously incomplete on its face); Fontbank, Inc. v. CompuServe, Inc., 742 N.E.2d 674 (Ohio Ct. App. 2000) (contract which appears complete and unambiguous on its face will be presumed final and complete expression of agreement; presumption is strongest where writing contains merger or integration clause). What policy considerations could be used to justify the “four corners” approach to the parol evidence rule?</p>
<p id="035f1371-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not surprisingly, perhaps, many other courts have adopted an alternative method to determining integration which more readily looks beyond the contents of the writing. The central precept for this contextual approach is reflected in Restatement (Second) §210, Comment <i>b</i>: “[A] writing cannot of itself prove its own completeness, and wide latitude must be allowed for inquiry into circumstances bearing on the intention of the parties.” This approach is also frequently identified with Professor Corbin. A finding of integration should always depend on the actual intent of the parties, according to Corbin, and a court should consider evidence of all the facts and circumstances surrounding the execution of the contract, as well as the writing, in uncovering that intent. 3 Corbin on Contracts §§578, 582, at 411-412, 448-450 (1960). In this approach, a merger clause will not be solely determinative of the issue of integration. See, e.g., St. James Mut. Homes v. Andrade, 951 A.2d 766 (D.C. Ct. App. 2008) (agreement between cooperative association and one of its members not fully integrated despite presence of merger clause; silence on material point requires court to look outside the writing); Morgan Bldgs. and Spas, Inc. v. Humane Soc’y of Southeast Texas, 249 S.W.3d 480 (Tex. Ct. App. 2008) (written agreement between customer and building manufacturer was only partially integrated, despite merger clause, permitting plaintiff to recover for defects in completed building). See also Restatement (Second) §216, Comment <i>e</i> (merger clause does not control question of integration); UCC §2-202, Comment 1(a) (rejects any assumption that writing that is final on some terms is necessarily exclusive). Professor Farnsworth reported that the trend among courts favors the Corbin-Restatement (Second) approach to determining integration. E. Allan Farnsworth, Contracts §7.3, at 419 (4th ed. 2004). Professor Linzer, however, more recently expressed doubts about the accuracy of that assessment. See Peter Linzer, 6 Corbin on Contracts § 25.7 (Joseph M. Perillo ed., 2010).</p></li>

<p id="035f1372-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court in Thompson v. Libby indicated that not all extrinsic evidence would be excluded by the parol evidence rule, even in the case of a fully integrated written agreement. Such evidence would be admissible, the court <span title="434" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-434">p. 434</span>indicated, “if necessary . . . to apply the contract to its subject-matter, or in order to a more perfect understanding of its language.” In addition, the <i>Thompson</i> court alluded in passing to the existence of certain exceptions to that rule. “No ground was laid for the reformation of the written contract, and any charge of fraud on part of plaintiff or his agent in making the sale was . . . expressly disclaimed.” Although the various exceptions have not yet reached the point where they “swallow up” the rule, they at least are so numerous and collectively so broad that the parol evidence rule has become — even more than the statute of frauds — a rule that can be understood only in light of its exceptions.</p>
<p id="035f1373-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The parol evidence rule does not apply to exclude evidence offered to interpret or explain the meaning of the agreement.</i> The parol evidence rule, as we have seen, applies only to written agreements that are in some sense intended by the parties to be a final expression of their agreement, or “integrated,” either “partially” or “completely.” If found to be a partial integration, the writing may not be contradicted by extrinsic evidence, but it may be supplemented by additional <i>consistent</i> terms. If the writing is a complete integration, then not only may it not be contradicted, it may not even be supplemented. Restatement (Second) §§210, 213; UCC §2-202. Whatever the degree of integration, however — partial, complete, or not at all — a written agreement may, as the <i>Thompson</i> court suggested, always be <i>explained</i> by extrinsic evidence for purposes of interpretation. Restatement (Second) §214(c), and Comment <i>b</i>.</p>
<p id="035f1374-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To illustrate these principles in application, let us return to the facts of Thompson v. Libby. Given the written agreement which existed in that case, extrinsic evidence would not have been admissible to prove that the agreed-on price for the wood was $8 a thousand feet, rather than $10, for this would have been regarded as a “contradictory” term. Nor would it have been permissible to show by extrinsic evidence that the seller was obliged not only to deliver the logs but also to mill them into planks; even if this were seen as a “consistent additional term,” rather than a contradictory one, the Thompson-Libby agreement was apparently regarded by the court as fully integrated, thus precluding the showing of additional terms (whether contradictory or not). It should, however, have been permissible to show by extrinsic evidence of the parties’ agreement what periods of time were intended to be included in the phrase “winters of 1882 and 1883,” or what was meant by the term “boom scale,” because such evidence would have served merely to “explain” the agreement. (On those points, evidence of trade usage might have been relevant as well.) Classical and modern courts might differ, however, on the scope of this latter exception. Classical courts generally admitted parol evidence for explanatory purposes only if the writing appeared on its face to be ambiguous, while modern courts are more likely to admit parol evidence to show that the language used in the agreement has a special meaning, even if that language does not appear unclear merely from an inspection of the writing. Restatement (Second) §214, Comment <i>b.</i> (Recall our discussion of patent and latent ambiguity after the <i>Frigaliment</i> case above.)</p>
<p id="035f1375-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Explanation or interpretation of the agreement may be in practice the most important of the reasons why extrinsic evidence may be admitted despite the <span title="435" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-435">p. 435</span>parol evidence rule, but it only begins the catalog of that rule’s exceptions. The following are some of the other commonly accepted ones:</p>
<p id="035f1376-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The parol evidence rule does not apply to agreements, whether oral or written, made after the execution of the writing.</i> Litman v. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., 739 F.2d 1549, 1558 (11th Cir. 1984) (evidence of subsequent oral modification of plaintiff’s written employment contract not barred by parol evidence rule; later written amendments not fully integrated so as to exclude proof of asserted oral agreement); John E. Murray, Jr., Murray on Contracts §85[A], at 424 (5th ed. 2011) (noting that “innumerable cases” support principle that parol evidence rule has no application to subsequent agreements or modifications). Suppose Thompson and Libby, having made the initial contract in June 1883, had orally agreed in August 1883 that payment for the logs would be made partly in cash and partly by promissory notes. In the event of subsequent litigation between them, the parol evidence rule would not bar testimony as to this later oral agreement.</p>
<p id="035f1377-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The parol evidence rule does not apply to evidence offered to show that effectiveness of the agreement was subject to an oral condition precedent.</i> Brown Dev. Corp. v. Hemond, 956 A.2d 104 (Me. 2008) (summary judgment for buyer reversed where seller alleged that buyer’s acquisition of an additional lot from a third party was oral condition precedent to seller’s obligation to transfer land; contract was not fully integrated, alleged oral condition did not contradict written terms, and thus evidence of oral condition was not barred by parol evidence rule); Restatement (Second) §217. But cf. Torres v. D’Alesso, 910 N.Y.S.2d 1 (N.Y. App. Div. 2010) (oral condition precedent exception will not be applied where agreement contains broad merger clause and asserted condition would contradict language of written agreement). Suppose Libby had told Thompson (or his agent) when the contract was signed that the agreement was contingent upon the local bank’s approval of a loan for which Libby had applied, and about which he would hear within a week. If the bank had denied the loan, the parol evidence rule would not bar evidence of Libby’s oral statement, even though the writing was absolute on its face, because the evidence would establish an oral condition to the effectiveness of the agreement.</p>
<p id="035f3a88-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The parol evidence rule does not apply to evidence offered to show that the agreement is invalid for any reason, such as fraud, duress, undue influence, incapacity, mistake, or illegality.</i> Restatement (Second) §214(d). This exception can be justified theoretically on the basis that such invalidating factors result in what is apparently a contract being in legal contemplation not a “contract” at all and thus not entitled to the benefit of the parol evidence rule. It also can be justified on the practical ground that while a written agreement may in fact be “a forgery, a joke, a sham, or an agreement without consideration, or it may be voidable for fraud, duress, mistake, or the like, or it may be illegal,” none of these things is likely to appear on the face of the document. Restatement (Second) §214, Comment <i>c.</i> To apply the parol evidence rule to exclude such evidence would in effect create a roadblock to the application of many important policies of the law. To continue our series of illustrations, suppose that <span title="436" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-436">p. 436</span>when Thompson and Libby entered into their contract, they both believed that 20,000 feet of logs had been cut, when in fact the true number was closer to 5,000. In that case, evidence of their discussions about the quantity to be sold should be admissible as bearing on the possible defense of mutual mistake of fact.</p>
<p id="035f3a89-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case of fraud is a little more problematic, however. Some courts would limit the fraud exception to cases of “fraud in the execution” (sometimes referred to as “fraud in the factum”). For example, suppose Thompson asks Libby to sign what he says is a receipt for logs delivered, but it’s really a “contract” for the sale of more logs. See DeArmitt v. New York Life Ins. Co., 73 A.3d 578 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2013) (under fraud in the execution exception to parol evidence rule plaintiffs could offer evidence that agent misrepresented that product being purchased was an investment annuity when it actually was a standard life insurance policy; plaintiffs had stated they did not want a life insurance policy). Most courts, however, will extend the fraud exception also to instances of “fraud in the inducement” — misrepresentations of fact that induce the other party to enter into the contract. Poeppel v. Lester, 827 N.W.2d 580 (S.D. 2013) (substantial majority of jurisdictions follow the traditional view that parol evidence rule is inapplicable in cases of fraudulent inducement even when writing is completely integrated or contains a merger clause). However, some courts will prohibit the introduction of parol evidence to support a claim of fraud in the inducement if the alleged misrepresentation directly contradicts a term in the writing. This limitation is discussed in the <i>Sherrodd</i> case later in this chapter and also in the section on misrepresentation in Chapter 7. Suppose Libby sought to show that in order to induce him to sign the contract, Thompson had represented that to his own personal knowledge at least half of the cut logs were good quality hardwood, while it later appeared that only a quarter or less met that description. Many courts would view evidence of that statement by Thompson as admissible under the fraud exception, even though as you can see it comes very close to the claim that Libby tried unsuccessfully to make in the actual case.</p>
<p id="035f3a8a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The parol evidence rule does not apply to evidence that is offered to establish a right to an “equitable” remedy, such as “reformation” of the contract.</i> Restatement (Second) §214(e). If one party can establish that a part of the agreement was inadvertently omitted from the writing due to some mistake (perhaps the error of a “scrivener,” a secretary, or even a computer printer), that party may seek judicial reformation of the agreement — a court order declaring that the mistakenly omitted provision will be treated in law as part of the agreement. Generally, however, a writing may be reformed in this fashion only if it is shown by “clear and convincing evidence” that the parties really did intend their written agreement to contain the term in question. Kimmel &amp; Silverman, P.C. v. Porro, 53 F. Supp. 3d 325 (D. Mass. 2014) (parol evidence rule allows extrinsic evidence to prove parties did not intend terms in settlement agreement to release claim against former attorneys, but mutual mistake in drafting must be shown by clear and convincing evidence). In <span title="437" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-437">p. 437</span><i>Thompson</i>, the defendant Libby might have sought to have the agreement reformed to include the warranty of quality, on grounds that it was accidentally omitted, but he probably would have been unable to meet this higher standard of proof — indeed, the court’s opinion suggests he did not even attempt to do so.</p>
<p id="035f3a8b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The parol evidence rule does not apply to evidence introduced to establish a “collateral” agreement between the parties.</i> In <i>Thompson</i>, the court held that evidence of an oral warranty as to quality was not admissible under the collateral agreement exception because that exception only applied to an agreement about a “subject distinct from that to which the writing relates.” By the time the first Restatement was drafted in the 1930s, a growing number of courts were adopting a more flexible approach to the parol evidence rule than that illustrated by the court in <i>Thompson</i>. Frequently, these courts relied on the collateral agreement exception to justify the admission of parol evidence, even when the evidence did not relate to a separate or distinct transaction. See Peter Linzer, 6 Corbin on Contracts §25.9 (Joseph M. Perillo ed., 2010). The Restatement (Second) continues the collateral agreement exception in §216(2), which provides that an agreement will not be regarded as fully integrated if the parties have made a consistent additional agreement which is either agreed to for separate consideration or is “such a term as in the circumstances might naturally be omitted from the writing.” As Professor Linzer has noted, if there is separate consideration for the oral “collateral agreement,” then it is a separate contract and the parol evidence rule should be irrelevant. On the other hand, if there is not separate consideration from that in the written contract, then the “collateral agreement” notion is indistinguishable from the question whether the contract was intended to be a complete integration.

<p id="035f3a8c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Uniform Commercial Code Comments express a somewhat similar approach regarding admissibility: Comment 3 to §2-202 indicates that “consistent additional terms” should be excluded under §2-202(b) only where the parties intend the writing to be a complete and exclusive statement of all terms (a complete integration) or the court concludes that if such terms had actually been agreed upon they would “certainly have been included in the document.” If the Thompson-Libby contract were made today, it would as a sale of goods be subject to Article 2 of the UCC; on the facts of <i>Thompson</i>, would buyer Libby have fared better under §2-202? Suppose that Libby were also to allege that Thompson had promised at the time their written agreement was signed that if Libby would buy the logs, Thompson would mill them into planks for Libby at Thompson’s sawmill for a discounted price (two-thirds of Thompson’s usual charge for that service), and that Thompson had later refused to honor that promise. Would evidence of the oral milling agreement be barred by the parol evidence rule?

<p id="035f61a3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Bobby Sid Taylor petitions us to review a decision reversing a jury verdict in his favor in a bad faith claim against State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. He argues that the court of appeals erroneously held that his bad faith claim was barred by a release he signed in 1981. We granted review because the case raises important issues in the area of contract and insurance law. . . . </p>

<p id="035f61a5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This insurance bad faith action arises out of an accident that occurred approximately sixteen years ago. Many of the facts are undisputed. The accident involved three vehicles — one occupied by Anne Ring and passenger James Rivers, the second by Douglas Wistrom, and the third by Bobby Sid Taylor. Ring, Rivers, and Taylor all were injured. The facts surrounding the accident are set forth in Ring v. Taylor, 141 Ariz. 56, 59, 685 P.2d 121, 124 (Ct. App. 1984). Ring, her husband, and Rivers filed actions against Taylor and Wistrom. These actions were consolidated before trial. Taylor’s insurer, State Farm, retained attorney Leroy W. Hofmann to defend Taylor. Taylor also personally retained attorney Norman Bruce Randall, who filed a counterclaim against Ring for Taylor’s damages. Taylor, therefore, was represented by both Randall and Hofmann in the matter. Because the Rings and Rivers agreed with Wistrom to a stipulated judgment and covenant not to execute, Taylor was the only party vulnerable to the Ring/Rivers claims. At trial, the Rings and Rivers obtained combined verdicts against Taylor for approximately $2.5 million in excess of his insurance policy limits. The court of appeals affirmed these judgments. <i>Taylor,</i> 141 Ariz. at 59, 71, 685 P.2d at 124, 136.</p>
<p id="035f61a6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Rings eventually settled with State Farm. Taylor, however, sued State Farm for bad faith seeking damages for the excess Rivers judgment, claiming, among other things, that State Farm improperly failed to settle the Rivers matter within policy limits. State Farm moved for summary judgment, asserting that Taylor relinquished his bad faith claim when, in 1981, he signed a release drafted by attorney Randall in exchange for State Farm’s payment of $15,000 in uninsured motorist benefits.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN107DB_2c3aa385-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N107DB_2c3aa385-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">1</a></span> Taylor also moved for partial summary judgment, seeking a ruling that, as a matter of law, the release did not preclude his bad faith claim. The judge denied both motions, finding that the release was ambiguous and that therefore parol evidence was admissible at trial to aid in interpreting the release. A second judge, who presided at trial, also denied State Farm’s motion for directed verdict based on the release. Having been instructed <span title="439" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-439">p. 439</span>on the interpretation of the release, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Taylor for compensatory damages of $2.1 million. The court also awarded Taylor $300,000 in attorney fees.</p>
<p id="035f61a8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court of appeals reversed, holding that the release agreement was not ambiguous and therefore the judge erred by admitting parol evidence to vary its terms. Taylor v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., No. 1 CA-CV 9908 (Sep. 17, 1991) (mem. dec.). Based on the agreement’s “four corners,” the court held that “it clearly release[d] all policy contract rights, claims, and causes of action that Taylor has or may have against State Farm.” Id. at 20. According to the court, because the release should have been strictly enforced, there was no basis for Taylor’s bad faith claim. Id. We believe the court’s decision both incorrectly applies settled legal principles and raises unsettled issues of contract interpretation.</p>

<p id="035f61aa-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Much of the dispute in this case centers on the events that surround the drafting of the release and the inferences that can be drawn from those events. As noted, the trial court found that the release was ambiguous and admitted extrinsic evidence to aid in its interpretation. The court of appeals found no ambiguity. <i>Taylor,</i> mem. dec. at 20, 23. In resolving this issue, we must address the scope and application of the parol evidence rule in Arizona and decide whether, under these facts, the trial court properly admitted extrinsic evidence to interpret the release.</p>
<p id="035f61ab-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>A. Legal Principles</b></p>
<p id="035f61ac-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The application of the parol evidence rule has been the subject of much controversy and scholarly debate. . . . “When two parties have made a contract and have expressed it in a writing to which they have both assented as the complete and accurate integration of that contract, evidence, whether parol or otherwise, of antecedent understandings and negotiations will not be admitted for the purpose of varying or contradicting the writing.” 3 Arthur L. Corbin, Corbin on Contracts §573, at 357 (1960) (“Corbin”). . . . Antecedent understandings and negotiations may be admissible, however, for purposes other than varying or contradicting a final agreement. 3 Corbin §576, at 384. Interpretation is one such purpose. 3 Corbin §579, at 412-13; Restatement (Second) of Contracts §214(c) &amp; cmt. b (1979) (“Restatement”).</p>
<p id="035f88bd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Interpretation is the process by which we determine the meaning of words in a contract. See Restatement §200. Generally, and in Arizona, a court will attempt to enforce a contract according to the parties’ intent. . . . “The primary and ultimate purpose of interpretation” is to discover that intent and to make it effective. 3 Corbin §572B, at 421 (1992 Supp.). The court must decide what evidence, other than the writing, is admissible in the interpretation process, bearing in mind that the parol evidence rule prohibits extrinsic evidence to vary or contradict, but not to interpret, the agreement. See 3 Corbin §543, at 130-34. These substantive principles are clear, but their application has been troublesome.<span title="440" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-440">p. 440</span></p>
<p id="035f88be-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i><b>1. Restrictive View</b></i></p>
<p id="035f88bf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the restrictive “plain meaning” view of the parol evidence rule, evidence of prior negotiations may be used for interpretation only upon a finding that some language in the contract is unclear, ambiguous, or vague. E. Allan Farnsworth, Farnsworth on Contracts §7.12, at 270 (1990) (“Farnsworth”). Under this approach, “if a writing, or the term in question, appears to be plain and unambiguous on its face, its meaning must be determined from the four corners of the instrument without resort to extrinsic evidence of any nature.” Calamari &amp; Perillo, supra §3-10, at 166-67. . . . Thus, if the judge finds from the face of a document that it conveys only one meaning, parol evidence is neither considered nor admitted for any purpose. The danger here, of course, is that what appears plain and clear to one judge may not be so plain to another (as in this case), and the judge’s decision, uninformed by context, may not reflect the intent of the parties.</p>
<p id="035f88c0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i><b>2. Corbin View</b></i></p>
<p id="035f88c1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the view embraced by Professor Corbin and the Second Restatement, there is no need to make a preliminary finding of ambiguity before the <i>judge considers</i> extrinsic evidence. 3 Corbin §542, at 100-05 (1992 Supp.); Restatement §212 cmt. b; Farnsworth §7.12, at 272. . . . Instead, the court considers all of the proffered evidence to determine its relevance to the parties’ intent and then applies the parol evidence rule to exclude from the fact finder’s consideration only the evidence that contradicts or varies the meaning of the agreement. 3 Corbin §542, at 100-01 (1992 Supp.). According to Corbin, the court cannot apply the parol evidence rule without first understanding the meaning the parties intended to give the agreement. Id. To understand the agreement, the judge cannot be restricted to the four corners of the document. Again, even under the Corbin view, the court can admit evidence for <i>interpretation</i> but must stop short of <i>contradiction.</i> See 3 Corbin §574, at 371-72. . . . </p>
<p id="035f88c2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i><b>3. Arizona View</b></i></p>
<p id="035f88c3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Writing for a unanimous court in Smith v. Melson, Inc., 135 Ariz. 119, 121-22, 659 P.2d 1264, 1266-67 (1983), Chief Justice Holohan expressly committed Arizona to the Corbin view of contract interpretation. . . . We have held that a court may consider surrounding circumstances, including negotiation, prior understandings, and subsequent conduct, but have not elaborated much further. . . . </p>
<p id="035f88c4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to Corbin, the proper analysis has two steps. First, the court <i>considers</i> the evidence that is alleged to determine the extent of integration, illuminate the meaning of the contract language, or demonstrate the parties’ intent. See 3 Corbin §542, at 100-01 (1992 Supp.). The court’s function at this stage is to eliminate the evidence that has no probative value in determining the parties’ intent. Id. The second step involves “finalizing” the court’s understanding of the contract. Id. at 100. Here, the parol evidence rule applies and <i>precludes <span title="441" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-441">p. 441</span>admission</i> of the extrinsic evidence that would vary or contradict the meaning of the written words. Id.</p>
<p id="035f88c5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even during the first step, the judge may properly decide not to consider certain offered evidence because it does not aid in interpretation but, instead, varies or contradicts the written words. See id. at 101. This might occur when the court decides that the asserted meaning of the contract language is so unreasonable or extraordinary that it is improbable that the parties actually subscribed to the interpretation asserted by the proponent of the extrinsic evidence. See id. “The more bizarre and unusual an asserted interpretation is, the more convincing must be the testimony that supports it.” 3 Corbin §579, at 420. At what point a judge stops “listening to testimony that white is black and that a dollar is fifty cents is a matter for sound judicial discretion and common sense.” Id.</p>
<p id="035f88c6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When interpreting a contract, nevertheless, it is fundamental that a court attempt to “ascertain and give effect to the intention of the parties at the time the contract was made if at all possible.” . . . If, for example, parties use language that is mutually intended to have a special meaning, and that meaning is proved by credible evidence, a court is obligated to enforce the agreement according to the parties’ intent, even if the language ordinarily might mean something different. See Restatement §212 cmt. b, illus. 3 &amp; 4. The judge, therefore, must avoid the often irresistible temptation to automatically interpret contract language as he or she would understand the words. This natural tendency is sometimes disguised in the judge’s ruling that contract language is “unambiguous.” See 3 Corbin §543A, at 159 (1992 Supp.). Words, however, are seldom so clear that they “apply themselves to the subject matter.” Restatement §214 cmt. b. On occasion, exposition of the evidence regarding the intention of the parties will illuminate plausible interpretations other than the one that is facially obvious to the judge. See id. Thus, ambiguity determined by the judge’s view of “clear meaning” is a troublesome concept that often obstructs the court’s proper and primary function in this area — to enforce the meaning intended by the contracting parties. See 3 Corbin §542, at 122-24. . . . </p>
<p id="035f88c7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recognizing these problems, we are hesitant to endorse, without explanation, the often repeated and usually over-simplified construct that ambiguity must exist before parol evidence is admissible. We have previously criticized the ambiguity prerequisite in the context of non-negotiated agreements. See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Wilson, 162 Ariz. 251, 257, 782 P.2d 727, 733 (1989) (recognizing the lack of logic in requiring ambiguity, which may be fortuitous, to prove the true terms of an agreement). . . . Moreover, a contract may be susceptible to multiple interpretations and therefore truly ambiguous yet, given the context in which it was negotiated, not susceptible to a clearly contradicting and wholly unpersuasive interpretation asserted by the proponent of extrinsic evidence. In such a case, it seems clear that a court should exclude that evidence as violating the parol evidence rule despite the presence of some contract ambiguity. Finally, and most important, the ambiguity determination distracts the court from its primary objective — to enforce the <span title="442" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-442">p. 442</span>contract as intended by the parties. Consequently, although relevant, contract ambiguity is not the only linchpin of a court’s decision to admit parol evidence.</p>
<p id="035fafd8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The better rule is that the judge first considers the offered evidence and, if he or she finds that the contract language is “reasonably susceptible” to the interpretation asserted by its proponent, the evidence is admissible to determine the meaning intended by the parties. See Restatement §215 cmt. b; see also Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. G.W. Thomas Dray. &amp; Rigging Co., 69 Cal. 2d 33, 69 Cal. Rptr. 561, 564, 566, 567-68, 442 P.2d 641, 644, 645-46 (1968). . . . The meaning that appears plain and unambiguous on the first reading of a document may not appear nearly so plain once the judge considers the evidence. In such a case, the parol evidence rule is not violated because the evidence is not being offered to contradict or vary the meaning of the agreement. To the contrary, it is being offered to explain what the parties truly may have intended. We believe that this rule embodies the concepts endorsed by Corbin and adopted by this court ten years ago in <i>Melson.</i> Other courts more recently have expressed approval of the position taken by Corbin and the Restatement (Second) of Contracts. See, e.g., C.R. Anthony Co. v. Loretto Mall Partners, 817 P.2d 238, 241-44 &amp; n.3 (N.M. 1991); Isbrandtsen v. North Branch Corp., 150 Vt. 575, 556 A.2d 81, 83-85 (1988); Berg v. Hudesman, 115 Wash.2d 657, 801 P.2d 222, 227-30 (1990); see also 3 Corbin §542, at 105-112 (Supp. 1992) (citing cases).</p>
<p id="035fafd9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A judge may not always be in a position to rule on a parol evidence objection at first blush, having not yet heard enough relevant evidence on the issue. If this occurs, the judge might, for example, admit the extrinsic evidence conditionally, reserve ruling on the issue until enough relevant evidence is presented, or, if the case is being tried to a jury, consider the evidence outside the jury’s presence. See, e.g., Ariz. R. Evid. 103(c), 104(b), 104(c), 105. Because the judge is in the best position to decide how to proceed, we leave this decision to his or her sound discretion. As noted also, the judge need not waste much time if the asserted interpretation is unreasonable or the offered evidence is not persuasive. A proffered interpretation that is highly improbable would necessarily require very convincing evidence. In such a case, the judge might quickly decide that the contract language is not reasonably susceptible to the asserted meaning, stop listening to evidence supporting it, and rule that its admission would violate the parol evidence rule. See 3 Corbin §542, at 112; §579, at 420.</p>

<p id="035fafe1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, we address the court of appeals’ holding that Taylor’s bad faith claim was only contractual and that the trial court erred by finding that the release language, which indisputably covered contractual matters, was unclear, requiring extrinsic evidence for interpretation. <i>Taylor,</i> mem. dec. at 16, 23.</p>
<p id="035fafe2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . .</p>
<p id="035fafe3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is true that bad faith has its genesis in contract. . . . Our cases show, however, that the precise legal character of a bad faith claim may depend on the context of the discussion. . . . </p>
<p id="035fafe4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the legal character of bad faith was and is not universally established, the release reasonably could be interpreted as Taylor asserts. The trial court, therefore, did not err in concluding that the text of the release did not necessarily cover claims for bad faith.</p>
<p id="035fafe5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>2. Was there Extrinsic Evidence to Support the Conclusion that the Release Language was Reasonably Susceptible to Taylor’s Interpretation?</b></p>
<p id="035fafe6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the time the parties made the agreement, it was obvious that Taylor had a sizable potential claim for bad faith. The release was agreed to months after the jury returned verdicts against Taylor and less than six months after this court recognized the tort of bad faith in <i>Noble.</i> Most of the alleged <span title="444" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-444">p. 444</span>conduct that is the basis for Taylor’s bad faith claim had already occurred. In fact, although occurring later, the Rings garnished State Farm seeking to satisfy their entire judgment, including the excess above the policy limits, based on State Farm’s liability to Taylor for alleged bad faith. Ring v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins., 147 Ariz. 32, 33, 708 P.2d 457, 458 (Ct. App. 1985). There was some evidence that Hofmann, on behalf of State Farm, directed that “general release language” be used in the agreement without expressly mentioning “bad faith.” The document’s cryptic language supports this. Such a direction, in light of the obvious nature of the claim, supports Taylor’s interpretation.</p>
<p id="035fafe7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Also, State Farm internally designated the $15,000 payment to Taylor as being for uninsured motorist (“UM”) coverage. Although State Farm denies its importance, its ultimate significance was for the fact finder to determine. State Farm’s subsequent conduct may shed light on its understanding of what was covered by the agreement. See <i>Darner,</i> 140 Ariz. at 393, 682 P.2d at 398. This, too, supports the idea that the release is reasonably susceptible to Taylor’s interpretation.</p>
<p id="035fd6f8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The potential size of the bad faith claim also cannot be ignored. At the time the parties entered into the release agreement, a jury had already rendered verdicts against Taylor far exceeding his insurance policy limits. Thus, the potential size of Taylor’s bad faith claim was obvious. We recognize that, with few exceptions, parties are free to structure a deal in any way they wish. Nevertheless, it is arguably reasonable to conclude that Taylor and his counsel would seek something more than just the payment of a potentially bona fide $15,000 UM claim to release a bad faith claim possibly worth millions of dollars.</p>
<p id="035fd6f9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, and perhaps most telling, is the fact that the parties used limiting language in the release. It is reasonable to believe that if the parties had agreed to release the bad faith claim, they would not have drawn the release so narrowly — confining it to “contractual” and “subsequent” matters, with <i>no</i> mention of tort claims or bad faith. Surely, State Farm knew what language would effectively release it from Taylor’s potential bad faith claim. It can be inferred that sophisticated parties in the business of settling insurance claims, faced with the task of releasing a claim as large as Taylor’s, would have used more specific or at least broader<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN108CF_2c3aa385-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N108CF_2c3aa385-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">7</a></span> language if that was their agreement. This is especially true in light of the conspicuous nature of the claim, the parties’ obvious knowledge of its existence, and the very recent supreme court authority characterizing the claim as a tort. . . . For these reasons, we hold that extrinsic evidence produces support for Taylor’s contention that the release language was not intended to release his bad faith claim.</p>
<p id="035fd6fb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is <i>not</i> to say, however, that the release language excluded bad faith as a matter of law. Substantial evidence supports State Farm’s interpretation as well. The release language is broad enough to release something more than just the <span title="445" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-445">p. 445</span>contractual UM claim.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN108E0_2c3aa385-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N108E0_2c3aa385-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">8</a></span> Also, the recitals refer to matters that may not pertain to UM coverage but are relevant to Taylor’s bad faith claim.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN108E6_2c3aa385-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N108E6_2c3aa385-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">9</a></span> Finally, there was credible evidence that both parties contemplated that bad faith would be covered by the release. All of the evidence, however, does not render the release language impervious to Taylor’s interpretation. Instead, it demonstrates that there were three reasonable, but conflicting, interpretations of the language used in the agreement: (1) the parties agreed to release the bad faith claim; (2) the parties agreed to exclude the bad faith claim; and (3) the parties did not reach any agreement regarding release of the bad faith claim (in which case, of course, the claim would not be released). In light of this, the trial judge correctly concluded that the release could not as a matter of law be interpreted to include or exclude Taylor’s bad faith claim.</p>

We have concluded in the preceding section that the language of the agreement, illuminated by the surrounding circumstances, indicates that either of the interpretations offered was reasonable. Because interpretation was needed and because the extrinsic evidence established controversy over what occurred and what inferences to draw from the events, the matter was properly submitted to the jury. See <i>Burkons,</i> 168 Ariz. at 351, 813 P.2d at 716; <i>Leo Eisenberg,</i> 162 Ariz. at 533, 785 P.2d at 53. The trial judge, therefore, instructed the jury as follows:</p>

Nevertheless, because the other issues were initially and fully presented to the court of appeals, prudence dictates that the court of appeals complete its review of this case as expeditiously as possible. The decision of the court of appeals pertaining to the release is vacated and the matter is remanded to the court of appeals for resolution of the remaining issues.</p>

<li class=""><p id="0360253e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Claims of insurer bad faith.</i> The <i>Taylor</i> opinion raises several significant points about insurance law and practice. The court indicates that Arizona recognizes a cause of action in tort against an insurance company for bad faith refusal to settle a policy claim. The issue of tort liability of insurers and other contracting parties for breach of contract is explored in a comment in Chapter 10 on the availability of punitive damages. For now it is probably sufficient for you to know that throughout the country courts have generally recognized that insurance companies can be liable when they refuse in bad faith to defend or settle claims brought under their policies. See generally Douglas R. Richmond, An Overview of Insurance Bad Faith Law and Litigation, 25 Seton Hall L. Rev. 74 (1994). Cases of bad faith refusal to defend or settle fall into two broad categories: third-party and first-party claims. In a third-party claim, the insured seeks to recover damages from her insurer because the insurer failed in bad faith to defend or settle a claim brought by a third party against the insured (for example, a claim covered by an automobile insurance policy). The significance of a bad faith claim is that the insurer can be held liable even for amounts in excess of the policy limit because of its bad faith conduct. In a first-party claim, the insured seeks to recover damages because the insurance company refused in bad faith a claim brought by the insured rather than a third party (for example, under a health or fire insurance policy). Courts have been somewhat more resistant to first-party than to third-party claims perhaps because damage to the insured in a third-party claim is clear and substantial (the amount in excess of the policy limit), while damage in a first-party claim (often emotional distress and punitive damages) may be more problematic. Nonetheless, a growing number of jurisdictions have recognized first-party bad faith tort claims. See generally, Sharon Tennyson &amp; William J. Warfel, The Law and Economics of First-Party Insurance Bad Faith Liability, 16 Conn. Ins. L.J. 203 (2009).</p>
<span title="449" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-449">p. 449</span>
<p id="0360253f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Note also that Taylor was represented by two lawyers. This situation can arise when the interests of the insured differ from those of the insurer. For a general discussion of the many difficult conflict of interest problems facing insurance defense counsel, see Nathan M. Crystal, Professional Responsibility: Problems of Practice and the Profession 233-317 (6th ed. 2017).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03602540-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Plain meaning, ambiguity, and the parol evidence rule.</i> The facts in <i>Taylor</i> point to the relationship between the “four corners” approach to determining integration of a writing under the parol evidence rule (as in <i>Thompson</i>) and the “plain meaning” approach to interpreting written terms (as used by the intermediate appellate court in <i>Taylor</i>). Courts that rely on the facial completeness of a written contract to conclude that it is fully integrated are likely to rely on the apparent plain meaning of words to bar use of extrinsic evidence to aid interpretation, and the presence of a merger clause may further impel such courts to assign a plain meaning to words. This tendency continues even though the usual formulation of the parol evidence rule, as reflected in both <i>Thompson</i> and <i>Taylor</i>, explicitly states that the parol evidence rule does not bar the use of extrinsic evidence to explain or interpret a writing.</p>
<p id="03602541-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While all courts will allow use of extrinsic evidence to interpret a contract with a patent or facial ambiguity, the point of difference is that “plain meaning” adherents will not allow use of extrinsic evidence to uncover a latent ambiguity. (Recall the discussion in the notes after the <i>Frigaliment</i> case on patent and latent ambiguity.) By contrast, the modern approach used by the Arizona Supreme Court in <i>Taylor</i> allows use of extrinsic evidence if the disputed language of the contract is “reasonably susceptible” to the different proffered meanings advanced by the parties. In making the determination of whether the language is susceptible of more than one meaning, the court will consider at least preliminarily the extrinsic evidence and need not find the agreement to be patently ambiguous. As the <i>Taylor</i> opinion states, the Restatement (Second) adopts generally the Corbin or modern approach. See particularly Restatement (Second) §214(c) and Comment <i>b</i> thereto (“[e]ven though words seem on their face to have only a single possible meaning, other meanings often appear when the circumstances are disclosed”).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03602542-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Continuing debate on use of parol evidence.</i> While the <i>Taylor</i> court and many others have adopted the Restatement or Corbin approach to use of extrinsic evidence in the process of interpretation, other judges strongly disagree. In Shay v. Aldrich, 790 N.W.2d 629 (Mich. 2010), the plaintiff alleged that he had been assaulted by a group of police officers, including three from one municipality (who were accused by the plaintiff of actual physical assault) and two from another (who were accused only of gross negligence in failing to intervene). Plaintiff’s claims against the latter two officers were settled by agreement between plaintiff and their insurer for an aggregate of $25,000. His claims against the remaining three officers had earlier been independently evaluated as being worth roughly $1.5 million. In plaintiff’s suit against those other three officers, their insurer relied on the settlement agreement, arguing that because its language at one point referred to a discharge of the two named defendants “together with all other firms, persons or corporations,” it necessarily released <span title="450" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-450">p. 450</span>plaintiffs’ claims against the other three officers as well, even though there was much evidence that this was <i>not</i> the parties’ intent, and no evidence that it <i>was</i>. Overruling an earlier decision, the Michigan Supreme Court held that in these circumstances parol evidence could be admitted to show that the actual intent of the parties was to discharge plaintiff’s claims against only the two named officers. Writing for a four-person majority, Justice Weaver declared:</p>

<p id="03604b53-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the facts of this case, if plaintiff were not permitted to present extrinsic evidence in order to ascertain the intent of the settling parties, the settling parties’ intent would undoubtedly be perverted. Plaintiff would be deprived of his claim for assault and battery against the Melvindale Officers. . . . Further, the Melvindale Officers would obtain a complete windfall by being released from liability for their acts in exchange for no bargained-for promise and no consideration at all, despite the fact that they do not dispute that this was not the intent of the settling parties. Not only would this be an unjust result, it would be contrary to the cardinal rule of contract interpretation: that the contracting parties’ intent should control.</p>

Writing for himself and two other dissenting justices, Justice Markman (himself the author of the overruled earlier decision) spent some 28 pages explaining why the majority was wrong on both the law and the facts to rule as it did. At one point, declaring that the Michigan court had “long ago” (citing and quoting an 1858 decision) held that a party to a contract has the duty to read and understand the contract that he signs, Justice Markman continued:</p>

Courts adhere to these fundamental rules — enforcing contracts according to their unambiguous terms, responsibly and diligently executing their judicial duty in determining if a contract is ambiguous, and insisting that parties read their contracts — because doing so respects the freedom of individuals freely to arrange their affairs via contract. . . . [T]he general rule [of contracts] is that competent persons shall have the utmost liberty of contracting and that their agreements voluntarily and fairly made shall be held valid and enforced in the courts. . . . It is precisely because these fundamental principles are so well settled and so essential to a free society, governed by the equal rule of law, that our citizens’ reliance on them is so great. Courts rightly adhere to these rules so as not to upend the expectations of the citizenry in an area of the law that touches upon their personal and commercial relations every day in myriad ways.</p>

Thus, the CISG takes a modified objective approach to interpretation which focuses on what the parties knew or had reason to know about each other’s intent, consistent with the Restatement (Second) §201, and permits use of all relevant extrinsic evidence in arriving at that interpretation, an approach that also appears largely consistent with the Restatement (Second) Contracts §§212, 214, as discussed in <i>Taylor.</i> See William S. Dodge, Teaching the CISG in Contracts, 50 J. Leg.

In MCC-Marble Ceramic Center, Inc. v. Ceramica Nuova d’Agostino, S.p.A., 144 F.3d 1384 (11th Cir. 1998), an American buyer and Italian seller disputed performance of a ceramic tile purchase transaction. The parties differed as to whether their transaction should be governed by their earlier oral agreement or by the terms of a later form contract, written in Italian, which contained terms not previously agreed on orally. The buyer claimed it never intended to be bound by the additional terms in the seller’s form, and that the seller knew that at the time. Framing the key question as whether the evidence of the earlier oral contract would be barred under the parol evidence rule since the parties later adopted a writing, the court concluded that the drafters of the CISG intended to reject the parol evidence rule and that Article 8(3) “is a clear instruction to admit and consider parol evidence regarding the negotiations to the extent they reveal the parties’ subjective intent.” 144 F.3d at 1389. The court thus reversed a grant of summary judgment in favor of the seller and remanded the case.</p></li>

(Sherrodd), is a family-owned Montana construction corporation. Sherrodd subcontracted with COP Construction (COP) to do certain earth-moving work involved in the construction of fifty family housing units in Forsyth, Montana, for the Army Corps of Engineers. COP itself was a subcontractor to the general contractors Morrison-Knudsen Company, Inc. (Morrison-Knudsen), and Schlekeway Construction, Inc. (Schlekeway). Safeco Insurance Company of America (Safeco) provided COP’s payment bond on the job.</p>
<p id="03607276-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sherrodd contends that while its officer William Sherrodd was examining the building site in preparation for submitting a bid on this project, a representative of Morrison-Knudsen told him that there were 25,000 cubic yards of excavation to be performed on the job. It claims that its bid of $97,500 on the subcontract was made in reliance on that representation, based on $3.90 per cubic yard for 25,000 cubic yards. Morrison-Knudsen denies that its representative made any such statement to William Sherrodd.</p>
<p id="03607277-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sherrodd’s bid, and, in turn, COP’s bid including Sherrodd’s bid, were submitted and accepted. Sherrodd began work before a written contract was signed. While performing the earthwork, Sherrodd discovered that the quantity of work far exceeded 25,000 cubic yards.</p>
<p id="03607278-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The written contract between Sherrodd and COP provided that Sherrodd would perform earthwork in the quantity “LS” for the consideration of $97,500. The parties agree that the letters “LS” mean lump sum. Sherrodd contends that its officers signed the contract, even though by then they knew that the job involved more than 25,000 cubic yards of earthwork, because a COP officer threatened to withhold payment for work already done unless the contract was signed. Sherrodd further contends that the COP officer verbally represented that a deal would be worked out wherein Sherrodd would be paid more than the sum provided for in the contract. COP’s position is that it only agreed to assist Sherrodd in presenting a claim for additional compensation to the Army Corps of Engineers, based on differences in the moisture content of the soil from that stated in the bid proposal. That was done, but the claim was denied.</p>

<p id="0360727b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sherrodd was paid the $97,500 provided for in the contract, less approximately $9,750 for work left uncompleted. It brought this suit to set aside the price provisions in the contract and to recover quantum meruit plus tort damages. Its legal theories were fraud, both actual and constructive, and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Defendants moved for summary <span title="453" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-453">p. 453</span>judgment, which was granted based on the parol evidence rule regarding modification of written contracts.</p>
<p id="0360727c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Summary judgment is proper when the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), M.R. Civ. P. The District Court held that, under the parol evidence rule, Sherrodd could not introduce evidence of the alleged oral misrepresentations by either the Morrison-Knudsen representative or the COP officer. Therefore, it concluded that even taking the evidence in the light most favorable to Sherrodd, summary judgment for defendants was proper.</p>
<p id="0360727d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The parol evidence rule is codified in Montana statutes. Section 28-2-904, MCA, provides that:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="0360727e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The execution of a contract in writing, whether the law requires it to be written or not, supersedes all the oral negotiations or stipulations concerning its matter which preceded or accompanied the execution of the instrument.</p>
</div>
<p id="0360727f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 28-2-905, MCA, provides that when an agreement has been reduced to writing by the parties, there can be no evidence of the terms of the agreement other than the contents of the writing except when a mistake or imperfection of the writing is claimed or when the validity of the agreement is the fact in dispute.</p>
<p id="03607280-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although it mentions mutual mistake in its brief to this Court, Sherrodd did not rely on that theory in the proceedings below, as evidenced in the pretrial order and in the District Court’s memorandum on the summary judgment. We will not consider on appeal a theory not raised at the trial court level. Morse v. Cremer (1982), 200 Mont. 71, 81, 647 P.2d 358, 363.</p>
<p id="03607281-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A further exception is made to the parol evidence rule when fraud is alleged. Section 28-2-905(2), MCA. However, that exception only applies when the alleged fraud does not relate directly to the subject of the contract. Where an alleged oral promise directly contradicts the terms of an express written contract, the parol evidence rule applies. Continental Oil Co. v. Bell (1933), 94 Mont. 123, 133, 21 P.2d 65, 67. Accord, Superior Oil Company v. Vanderhoof (D. Mont. 1969), 297 F. Supp. 1086.</p>
<p id="03609992-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, any reliance on the alleged fraudulent statement of the Morrison-Knudsen representative is contradicted by the terms of the written contract that Sherrodd has, “by examination, satisfied himself as to the . . . character, quantity and kind of materials to be encountered.” The contention that the $97,500 covered only 25,000 cubic yards of earthwork contradicts the terms of the written agreement that all “negotiations and agreements” prior to the date of the contract are merged in the writing and that the work to be done is “lump sum.” We conclude that the parol evidence rule applies. Because the written agreement supersedes all previous oral agreements, the rule prohibits admission of any evidence of the representation by the Morrison-Knudsen representative.</p>
<p id="03609993-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="454" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-454">p. 454</span>Next we consider Sherrodd’s claim that COP officers induced Sherrodd officers to sign the contract with the promise that more money would be paid than the contract provided. Section 28-2-1602, MCA, provides that a written contract may be altered only by a subsequent contract in writing or by an executed oral agreement. Also, Sherrodd’s subcontract provided that “No changes . . . shall be valid . . . unless reduced to writing and signed by the parties hereto.” As the District Court noted, there is no allegation of a subsequent contract in writing, and if there had been an executed oral agreement to pay additional sums for the work, there would have been no reason for this lawsuit.</p>
<p id="03609994-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because of the inadmissibility of Sherrodd’s evidence as to alleged misrepresentations, the claim of breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing also fails. There is no allegation of any violation of the express terms of the written contract, as would be required in this arms-length contract under our opinion in Story v. City of Bozeman (1990), 242 Mont. 436, 791 P.2d 767.</p>

It was based on that information that he submitted his bid. It was based on his bid that he was given an oral request to proceed with the work.</p>
<p id="0360c0b1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After commencing work on the project, plaintiff realized that the amount of earth that had to be moved greatly exceeded 25,000 cubic yards, and was actually more than twice that amount. He had conversations with representatives of both COP Construction and Schlekeway and Associates, during which it was agreed that the amount of work to be performed would be recalculated, and during which the defendants agreed to compensate plaintiff on the basis of the actual amount of work done, rather than the price which was originally agreed upon.</p>
<p id="0360c0b2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By May 22, 1985, plaintiff had already been working on the project and had incurred substantial expenses and obligations to his own employees. He had not been paid for his work, and was still operating without a written agreement. It was on that date that he was requested by COP Construction’s superintendent to sign the written contract which the defendants now assert as a bar to his cause of action. He was advised that if he did not sign the agreement he would not receive the progress payment in the amount of $70,372.80 which was due. Without the progress payment he would not have been able to pay his current expenses and payroll.</p>
<p id="0360c0b3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">He was further advised that he would not be bound by the terms of the written agreement, but that he would be paid for the actual work done at the rate of $3.90 per cubic yard.</p>
<p id="0360c0b4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thereafter, the amount of earth work to be done was recalculated at approximately 50,000 cubic yards. On that basis, plaintiff tried to recover the full amount due, but payment was refused. Instead, the defendants raised the written agreement as a bar to any further payment to the plaintiff.</p>
<p id="0360c0b5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because of the defendants’ failure to pay the plaintiff the additional $100,000 to $120,000 which they owed him, plaintiff’s business lost its ability to borrow money, lost its bonding, and was unable to complete additional contracts because of a lack of operating capital. Plaintiff was unable to bid on contracts that required bonding, and completely lost its ability to carry on business as it had in the past. As a direct result of the defendants’ failure to pay the amounts due, plaintiff was unable to continue in business as a construction company, which it had done for the previous 30 years.</p>
<p id="0360c0b6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the plaintiff’s allegations are true, then defendant COP Construction Company’s conduct, at least, satisfies the elements of fraud. See Poulsen, et al. v. Treasure State Industries, 192 Mont. 69, 626 P.2d 822 (1981). COP’s employees represented to the plaintiff that he would be paid for the full amount of work done, regardless of the written terms of the contract. That representation was untrue and material, and COP’s superintendent either knew it was untrue or had no reason to believe that it was true. COP Construction intended that the plaintiff act in reliance upon that representation. Plaintiff did rely on it, <span title="456" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-456">p. 456</span>and had no reason to believe that COP’s superintendent would mislead him.

<p id="0360c0b7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority has affirmed the dismissal of plaintiff’s claim based solely on the parol evidence rule found at §28-2-904, MCA.

See Restatement (Second) §214(d). Many courts agree with the majority in <i>Sherrodd, however,</i> that a party cannot base a claim of fraud upon the very type of representation that is expressly disclaimed in the writing. See, e.g., Solymar Investments, Ltd. v. Banco Santander S.A., 672 F.3d 981 (11th Cir. 2012) (under Florida law parol evidence rule bars proof of alleged fraud that would directly contradict express terms in written agreement or when writing purports to be complete agreement of parties). On the other hand<i>,</i> a number of courts would agree with the dissent in <i>Sherrodd</i> that not even the combination of a merger clause and a specific disclaimer can shield a party from a claim of fraud. See, e.g., Pancakes of Hawaii, Inc. v. Pomare Properties Corp., 944 P.2d 97 (Haw. Ct. App. 1997) (merger clause with disclaimer of oral representations would not bar parol evidence to support allegation of false statements about occupancy level of new shopping center). In Riverisland Cold Storage, Inc. v. Fresno-Madera Production Credit Ass’n, 291 P. 3d 316 (Cal. 2013), the California Supreme Court held — overruling long-standing California precedent to the contrary — that the traditional fraud exception to application of the parol evidence rule should be available in claims of both fraud in the execution and fraud in the inducement (see the text following the <i>Thompson</i> case, supra), even if the asserted fraud appeared to be directly contradicted by the written agreement. The fraud alleged in <i>Riverisland</i> was fraud in the inducement, but it was also “promissory fraud.” The court clearly intended that evidence of such fraud — although typically difficult to prove, because of the need to show intent — should fall within the fraud exception, and be admissible despite the presence of an integrated writing apparently negating it. See also IIG Wireless, Inc. v. Yi, 231 Cal. Rptr. 3d 771 (Ct. App. 2018) (<i>Riverisland</i> should be broadly interpreted to apply both to <span title="458" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-458">p. 458</span>claims for rescission and to actions for damages based on fraud). On remand, however, the trial court in <i>Riverisland</i> again granted summary judgment for the defendant, ruling that the plaintiff had not been able to show justifiable reliance on the asserted fraudulent promise. That ruling was affirmed on appeal. Riverisland Cold Storage, Inc. v. Fresno-Madera Production Credit Ass’n, 2015 WL 2213195 (Cal. Ct. App.), <i>Cal. Sup. Ct. review denied (</i>Aug. 12, 2015).</p></li>

In his analysis of the role of reliance in modern contract law, Professor Knapp offers the following view of <i>Sherrodd</i>:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="0360e7d8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Each party has a reliance story to tell, and each story — if true — is compelling. If Sherrodd is telling the truth, he has at least been misled, possibly been consciously lied to, and in any event been bullied and ultimately betrayed by the defendant’s agents. In reliance on their assurances, he has completed his performance while at the same time binding himself to the very written document that may prevent him from recovering the full payment that he was promised, which he has honestly earned. To deny him his claim in these circumstances is clearly an injustice.</p>
<p id="03610ee9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But what if Sherrodd’s story is a lie? Then COP is being asked to pay more than Sherrodd had agreed to accept for his services, even though COP has bound itself in turn to Morrison-Knudsen, relying on Sherrodd’s willingness to render his performance at the originally agreed upon figure. And all this in the teeth of Sherrodd’s signing of a written contract that expressly binds him to the agreement he now repudiates. If these are indeed the true facts, then surely to allow Sherrodd his claim would also be an injustice. How should this dilemma be resolved?</p>
</div>
<p id="03610eea-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professor Knapp goes on to suggest that the judge should hear evidence of these conflicting stories and determine whether Sherrodd’s story is sufficiently credible to be considered by the trier of fact. In support of the modern, Corbinian view of the parol evidence rule, Professor Knapp argues that this approach should be used because the stricter view of the parol evidence rule represented by <i>Sherrodd</i> embodies a flawed world view:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03610eeb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Proponents of a strong parol evidence rule may see [the conflict between approaches to the parol evidence rule] simply as the difference between tidiness and sloppiness, or as the difference between prudence and heedlessness, and those factors surely play a part. But at the most basic level, it’s the difference between a world that runs on paper, and a world that runs on face-to-face communication — between a world that says “I don’t believe it unless I see it in writing, and I won’t <i>do</i> it unless a writing tells me to,” and a world that says, “If you assure me this is so, I will take you at your word, and rely on that, as you well know.”</p>
<p id="03610eec-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Each one of us lives, simultaneously, in both of those worlds. We have no choice in the matter. If the parol evidence rule forces a court to envision our world as being one where <i>only</i> paper matters, or — the slightly weaker version — a world where paper <i>always</i> prevails over face-to-face communication, then that rule forces the court (along with the rest of us) to deny something we <span title="459" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-459">p. 459</span>know to be true. And that something is simply this: There are situations where it is, truly, more reasonable to rely on a spoken word of commitment than on a piece of paper, signed or not. And there should be.</p>

J. 1191, 1322-1323, 1325 (1998). Other scholars have also expressed concern about the willingness of courts to give great deference to the written contract despite the reality of parties’ frequent reliance on oral commitments. See Ralph James Mooney, The New Conceptualism in Contract Law, 74 Or. L. Rev. 1131, 1170-1171 (1995); Jay M. Feinman, Un-Making Law: The Classical Revival in the Common Law, 28 Seattle U. L.

<li class=""><p id="03610eee-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Other exceptions to the parol evidence rule.</i> Sherrodd could have asserted legal theories other than fraud in an effort to convince the court to admit parol evidence. The court mentions the possibility of mutual mistake, but rejects this contention because the plaintiff did not raise the issue at the trial court. Another theory not mentioned in the opinion is the possibility that the agreement was unenforceable because of economic duress. Sherrodd claimed that he signed the agreement when the defendant threatened to refuse to make a progress payment for work that was already done, without which Sherrodd could not pay his employees or meet current expenses. We discuss duress further in Chapter 7 and mistake in Chapter 8. Based on your studies thus far, does it seem to you that Sherrodd might have had more success if he had attempted to proceed on either a mistake or a duress theory? Why? At the very least the possible applicability of these doctrines shows how the quality of lawyering may have an impact on the outcome of a case.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03610eef-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Promissory estoppel and the parol evidence rule.</i> In earlier chapters, we saw the doctrine of promissory estoppel being used by courts in a variety of ways: as a substitute for consideration, permitting recovery for detrimental reliance on a gratuitous promise; as a basis for holding an offer open despite the offeror’s attempt to revoke; as a basis for enforcing an oral agreement within the statute of frauds despite the lack of a memorandum signed by the defendant. While there are a handful of cases that appear to hold that the parol evidence rule does not bar a showing of extrinsic evidence that the plaintiff detrimentally relied on promises or assurances not contained in an integrated written contract, most cases have rejected the use of promissory estoppel to avoid the parol evidence rule. Compare Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. v. Clark, 456 F.2d 932 (5th Cir. 1972) (evidence of reliance on insurance agent’s oral promise to obtain life insurance without war risk exclusion not barred), with Banbury v. Omnitrition Int’l Inc., 533 N.W.2d 876 (Minn. Ct. App. 1995) (party cannot use the doctrine of promissory estoppel to alter a contract based on evidence barred by the parol evidence rule). The relationship between the parol evidence rule and promissory estoppel is further discussed in Charles L. Knapp, Rescuing Reliance: The Perils of Promissory Estoppel, 49 Hastings L. J. 1191, 1322-1330 (1998); see also David G. Epstein, Melinda Arbuckle &amp; Kelly Flanagan, Contract Law’s Two “P.E.’s”: Promissory Estoppel and the Parol Evidence Rule, 62 Baylor L. Rev. 397 (2010), which argues that the real issue is not whether the parol evidence rule <span title="460" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-460">p. 460</span>should bend to the doctrine of promissory estoppel, but whether the asserted reliance was reasonable in the circumstances.</p></li>

<p id="03613606-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant Nanakuli Paving and Rock Company (Nanakuli) initially filed this breach of contract action against appellee Shell Oil Company (Shell) in Hawaiian State Court in February, 1976. Nanakuli, the second largest asphaltic paving contractor in Hawaii, had bought all its asphalt requirements from 1963 to 1974 from Shell under two long-term supply contracts; its suit charged Shell with breach of the later 1969 contract. The jury returned a verdict of $220,800 for Nanakuli on its first claim, which is that Shell breached the 1969 contract in January, 1974, by failing to price protect Nanakuli on 7200 tons of asphalt at the time Shell raised the price for asphalt from $44 to $76. Nanakuli’s theory is that price-protection, as a usage of the asphaltic paving trade in Hawaii, was incorporated into the 1969 agreement between the parties, as demonstrated by the routine use of price protection by suppliers to that trade, and reinforced by the way in which Shell actually performed the 1969 contract up until 1974. Price protection, appellant claims, required that Shell hold the price on the tonnage Nanakuli had already committed because Nanakuli had incorporated that price into bids put out to or contracts awarded by general contractors and government agencies. The District Judge set aside the verdict and granted Shell’s motion for judgment n.o.v., which decision we vacate. . . . </p>

<p id="0361360a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nanakuli offers two theories for why Shell’s failure to offer price protection in 1974 was a breach of the 1969 contract. First, it argues, all material suppliers to the asphaltic paving trade in Hawaii followed the trade usage of price protection and thus it should be assumed, under the U.C.C., that the parties intended to incorporate price protection into their 1969 agreement. This is so, Nanakuli continues, even though the written contract provided for price to be “Shell’s Posted Price at time of delivery,” F.O.B. Honolulu. Its proof of a usage that was incorporated into the contract is reinforced by evidence of the commercial context, which under the U.C.C. should form the background for viewing a particular contract. The full agreement must be examined in light of the close, almost symbiotic relations between Shell and Nanakuli on the island of Oahu, whereby the expansion of Shell on the island was intimately connected to the business growth of Nanakuli. The U.C.C. looks to the actual performance of a contract as the best indication of what the parties intended <span title="461" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-461">p. 461</span>those terms to mean. Nanakuli points out that Shell had price protected it on the two occasions of price increases under the 1969 contract other than the 1974 increase. In 1970 and 1971 Shell extended the old price for four and three months, respectively, after an announced increase. This was done, in the words of Shell’s agent in Hawaii, in order to permit Nanakuli’s to “chew up” tonnage already committed at Shell’s old price.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C4C_2c3aa385-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10C4C_2c3aa385-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">4</a></span></p>
<p id="0361360c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nanakuli’s second theory for price protection is that Shell was obliged to price protect Nanakuli, even if price protection was not incorporated into their contract, because price protection was the commercially reasonable standard for fair dealing in the asphaltic paving trade in Hawaii in 1974. Observance of those standards is part of the good-faith requirement that the Code imposes on merchants in performing a sales contract. Shell was obliged to price protect Nanakuli in order to act in good faith, Nanakuli argues, because such a practice was universal in that trade in that locality.</p>
<p id="0361360d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Shell presents three arguments for upholding the judgment n.o.v. or, on cross appeal, urging that the District Judge erred in admitting certain evidence. First, it says, the District Court should not have denied Shell’s motion in limine to define trade, for purposes of trade usage evidence, as the sale and purchase of asphalt in Hawaii, rather than expanding the definition of trade to include other suppliers of materials to the asphaltic paving trade. Asphalt, its argument runs, was the subject matter of the disputed contract and the only product Shell supplied to the asphaltic paving trade. Shell protests that the judge, by expanding the definition of trade to include the other major suppliers to the asphaltic paving trade, allowed the admission of highly prejudicial evidence of routine price protection by all suppliers of aggregate. Asphaltic concrete paving is formed by mixing paving asphalt with crushed rock, or aggregate, in a “hot-mix” plant and then pouring the mixture onto the surface to be paved. Shell’s second complaint is that the two prior occasions on which it price protected Nanakuli, although representing the only other instances of price increases under the 1969 contract, constituted mere waivers of the contract’s price term, not a course of performance of the contract. A course of performance of the contract, in contrast to a waiver, demonstrates how the parties understand the terms of their agreement. Shell cites two U.C.C. Comments in support of that argument: (1) that, when the meaning of acts is ambiguous, the preference is for the waiver interpretation, and (2) that one act alone does not constitute a relevant course of performance. Shell’s final argument is that, even assuming its prior price protection constituted a course of performance and that the broad trade definition was correct and evidence of trade usages by aggregate suppliers was admissible, price protection could not be construed as reasonably consistent with the express price term in the contract, in which case the Code provides that the express term controls. . . .<span title="462" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-462">p. 462</span></p>

In 1963, Nanakuli negotiated a five-year contact with Shell, which provided Nanakuli with a guaranteed supply of asphalt at reduced prices. The new agreement enabled Shell to increase its presence as an asphalt supplier in Hawaii and allowed Nanakuli to expand its paving business.</p>
<p id="03615d20-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1968, Shell and Nanakuli entered into further negotiations. Nanakuli wished to expand its cement plant at a cost of approximately $300,000. Nanakuli and Shell originally discussed Shell’s financing of the expansion, but the parties finally agreed on indirect financing through a $2 discount on all sales of asphalt over 5,000 tons. In 1969, Nanakuli borrowed funds from its bank to finance the expansion. At the same time, Nanakuli and Shell executed several agreements, including a long-term supply contract to run until 1976.</p>

<p id="03615d23-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The key to price protection being so prevalent in 1969 that both parties would intend to incorporate it into their contract is found in one reality of the Oahu asphaltic paving market: the largest paving contracts were let by government agencies and none of the three levels of government — local, state, or federal — allowed escalation clauses for paving materials. If a paver bid at one price and another went into effect before the award was made, the paving company would lose a great deal of money, since it could not pass on increases to any government agency or to most general contractors. Extensive evidence was presented that, as a consequence, aggregate suppliers routinely price protected paving contractors in the 1960’s and 1970’s, as did the largest asphaltic supplier in Oahu, Chevron. . . . </p>

<p id="03615d25-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Code considers actual performance of a contract as the most relevant evidence of how the parties interpreted the terms of that contract. In 1970 and 1971, the only points at which Shell raised prices between 1969 and 1974, it price protected Nanakuli by holding its old price for four and three months, respectively, after announcing a price increase. . . . </p>

<p id="03615d27-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two important factors form the backdrop for the 1974 failure by Shell to price protect Nanakuli: the Arab oil embargo and a complete change of command and policy in Shell’s asphalt management. The jury was read a page or so from the World Book about the events and effect of the partial oil embargo, which shortened supplies and increased the price of petroleum, of which asphalt <span title="463" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-463">p. 463</span>is a byproduct. The federal government imposed direct price controls on petroleum, but not on asphalt. Despite the international importance of those events, the jury may have viewed the second factor as of more direct significance to this case. The structural changes at Shell offered a possible explanation for why Shell in 1974 acted out of step with, not only the trade usage and commercially reasonable practices of all suppliers to the asphaltic paving trade on Oahu, but also with its previous agreement with, or at least treatment of, Nanakuli. . . . </p>
<p id="03615d28-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that the decision to deny Nanakuli price protection was made by new Houston management without a full understanding of Shell’s 1969 agreement with Nanakuli or any knowledge of its past pricing practices toward Nanakuli. If Shell did commit itself in 1969 to price protect Nanakuli, the Shell officials who made the decisions affecting Nanakuli in 1974 knew nothing about that commitment. Nor did they make any effective effort to find out. They acted instead solely in reliance on the 1969 contract’s express price term, devoid of the commercial context that the Code says is necessary to an understanding of the meaning of the written word. Whatever the legal enforceability of Nanakuli’s right, Nanakuli officials seem to have acted in good faith reliance on its right, as they understood it, to price protection and rightfully felt betrayed by Shell’s failure to act with any understanding of its past practices toward Nanakuli.</p>

<p id="03615d2a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The validity of the jury verdict in this case depends on four legal questions. First, how broad was the trade to whose usages Shell was bound under its 1969 agreement with Nanakuli: did it extend to the Hawaiian asphaltic paving trade or was it limited merely to the purchase and sale of asphalt, which would only include evidence of practices by Shell and Chevron? Second, were the two instances of price protection of Nanakuli by Shell in 1970 and 1971 waivers of the 1969 contract as a matter of law or was the jury entitled to find that they constituted a course of performance of the contract? Third, could the jury have construed an express contract term of Shell’s posted price at delivery as reasonably consistent with a trade usage and Shell’s course of performance of the 1969 contract of price protection, which consisted of charging the old price at times of price increases, either for a period of time or for specific tonnage committed at a fixed price in non-escalating contracts? Fourth, could the jury have found that good faith obliged Shell to at least give advance notice of a $32 increase in 1974, that is, could they have found that the commercially reasonable standards of fair dealing in the trade in Hawaii in 1974 were to give some form of price protection?</p>
<p id="0361843b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We approach the first issue in this case mindful that an underlying purpose of the U.C.C. as enacted in Hawaii is to allow for liberal interpretation of commercial usages. The Code provides, “This chapter shall be liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes and policies.” Haw. Rev. Stat. §490:1-102(1). Only three purposes are listed, one of which is “[t]o permit the continued expansion of commercial practices through custom, usage and agreement of the parties. . . .” Id. §490:1-102(2)(b). . . . </p>
<p id="0361843c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="464" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-464">p. 464</span>The Code defines usage of trade as “any practice or method of dealing having such regularity of observance in a <i>place, vocation or trade</i> as to justify an expectation that it will be observed with respect to the transaction in question.” Id. §490:1-205(2) (emphasis supplied). We understand the use of the word “or” to mean that parties can be bound by a usage common to the <i>place</i> they are in business, even if it is not the usage of their particular vocation or trade. That reading is borne out by the repetition of the disjunctive “or” in subsection 3, which provides that usages “in the vocation or trade in which they are engaged <i>or</i> of which they are or should be aware give particular meaning to and supplement or qualify terms of an agreement.” Id. §490: 1-205(3). The drafters’ Comments say that trade usage is to be used to reach the “. . . commercial meaning of the agreement. . . .” by interpreting the language “as meaning what it may fairly be expected to mean to parties involved in the particular transaction <i>in a given locality or</i> in a given <i>vocation or trade.</i>” Id., Comment 4 (emphasis supplied). The inference of the two subsections and the Comment, read together, is that a usage need not necessarily be one practiced by members of the party’s own trade or vocation to be binding <i>if</i> it is so commonly practiced in a locality that a party should be aware of it. . . . This language indicates that Shell would be bound not only by usages of sellers of asphalt but by more general usages on Oahu, as long as those usages were so regular in their observance that Shell should have been aware of them. This reading of the Code, in our opinion, achieves an equitable result. A party is always held to conduct generally observed by members of his chosen trade because the other party is justified in so assuming unless he indicates otherwise. He is held to more general business practices to the extent of his actual knowledge of those practices or to the degree his ignorance of those practices is not excusable: they were so generally practiced he should have been aware of them.</p>
<p id="0361843d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The court then cites two leading treatises — Corbin on Contracts and White &amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code — to support its interpretation. — <span class="epub-small-caps">Eds</span>.]. [Thus,] even if Shell did not “regularly deal” with aggregate supplies, it did deal constantly and almost exclusively on Oahu with one asphalt paver. It therefore should have been aware of the usage of Nanakuli and other asphaltic pavers to bid at fixed prices and therefore receive price protection from their materials suppliers due to the refusal by government agencies to accept escalation clauses. Therefore, we do not find the lower court abused its discretion or misread the Code as applied to the peculiar facts of this case in ruling that the applicable trade was the asphaltic paving trade in Hawaii. . . . </p>
<p id="0361843e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Shell argued not only that the definition of trade was too broad, but also that the practice itself was not sufficiently regular to reach the level of a usage and that Nanakuli failed to show with enough precision how the usage was carried out in order for a jury to calculate damages. The extent of a usage is ultimately a jury question. The Code provides, “The existence and scope of such a usage are to be proved as facts.” Haw. Rev. Stat. §490:1-205(2). The practice must have “such regularity of observance . . . as to justify an expectation that it will be observed. . . .” Id.

A “regularly observed” practice of protection, of which Shell “should have been aware,” was enough to constitute a usage that Nanakuli had reason to believe was incorporated into the agreement.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10CE2_2c3aa385-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10CE2_2c3aa385-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">28</a></span></p>
<p id="03618442-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nanakuli went beyond proof of a regular observance. It proved and offered to prove that price protection was probably a universal practice by suppliers to the asphaltic paving trade in 1969. It had been practiced by H.C. &amp; D. since at least 1962, by P.C. &amp; A. since well before 1960, and by Chevron routinely for years, with the last specific instance before the contract being March, 1969, as shown by documentary evidence. The only usage evidence missing was the behavior by Shell, the only other asphalt supplier in Hawaii, prior to 1969. That was because its only major customer was Nanakuli and the judge ruled prior course of dealings between Shell and Nanakuli inadmissible. Shell did not point in rebuttal to one instance of failure to price protect by any supplier to an asphalt paver in Hawaii before its own 1974 refusal to price protect Nanakuli. Thus, there clearly was enough proof for a jury to find that the practice of price protection in the asphaltic paving trade existed in Hawaii in 1969 and was regular enough in its observance to rise to the level of a usage that would be binding on Nanakuli and Shell.</p>
<p id="03618443-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Shell next argues that, even if such a usage existed, its outlines were not precise enough to determine whether Shell would have extended the old price for Nanakuli for several months or would have charged the old price on the volume of tonnage committed at that price. The jury awarded Nanakuli damages based on the specific tonnage committed before the price increase of 1974. Shell says the jury could not have ascertained with enough certainty how price protection was carried out to calculate such an award for Nanakuli. The argument is not persuasive. The Code provides, “The remedies provided by this chapter shall be liberally administered to the end that the aggrieved party may be put in as good a position as if the other party had fully performed. . . .” Id. §490:1-106(1). The Comments list as one of three purposes of this section “to reject any doctrine that damages must be calculable with mathematical accuracy. Compensatory damages are often at best approximate: they have to be proved with whatever definiteness and accuracy the facts permit, but no more.” Id., Comment <span title="466" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-466">p. 466</span>1. Nanakuli got advance notices of each but the disputed increase by Shell, as well as an extension of several months at the old price in 1970, 1971, 1977, and 1978. Shell protests that in 1970 and 1971 Nanakuli’s protected tonnage only amounted to 3,300 and 1,100 tons, respectively. Chevron’s price protection of H.B. in 1969 however, is also part of the trade usage; H.B.’s protection amounted to 12,000 tons. The increase in Nanakuli’s tonnage by 1974 is explained by its growth since the 1970 and 1971 increases.</p>
<p id="03618444-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition, the scope of protection offered by a particular usage is left to the jury. . . . The manner in which the usage of price protection was carried out was presented with sufficient precision to allow the jury to calculate damages at $220,800.</p>

<p id="0361ab56-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Course of performance under the Code is the action of the parties in carrying out the contract at issue, whereas course of dealing consists of relations between the parties <i>prior</i> to signing that contract. Evidence of the latter was excluded by the District Judge; evidence of the former consisted of Shell’s price protection of Nanakuli in 1970 and 1971. Shell protested that the jury could not have found that those two instances of price protection amounted to a course of performance of its 1969 contract, relying on two Code comments. First, one instance does not constitute a course of performance. “A single occasion of conduct does not fall within the language of this section. . . .” Haw. Rev. Stat. §490:2-208, Comment 4. Although the Comment rules out one instance, it does not further delineate how many acts are needed to form a course of performance. The prior occasions here were only two, but they constituted the only occasions before 1974 that would call for such conduct. In addition, the language used by a top asphalt official of Shell in connection with the first price protection of Nanakuli indicated that Shell felt that Nanakuli was entitled to some form of price protection. On that occasion in 1970 Blee, who had negotiated the contract with Nanakuli and was familiar with exactly what terms Shell was bound to by that agreement, wrote of the need to “bargain” with Nanakuli over the extent of price protection to be given, indicating that some price protection was a legal right of Nanakuli’s under the 1969 agreement.</p>
<p id="0361ab57-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Shell’s second defense is that the Comment expresses a preference for an interpretation of waiver. . . . Id., Comment 3. The preference for waiver only applies, however, where acts are ambiguous. It was within the province of the jury to determine whether those acts were ambiguous, and if not, whether they constituted waivers or a course of performance of the contract. The jury’s interpretation of those acts as a course of performance was bolstered by evidence offered by Shell that it again price protected Nanakuli on the only two occasions of post-1974 price increases, in 1977 and 1978.</p>

<p id="0361ab59-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Perhaps one of the most fundamental departures of the Code from prior contract law is found in the parol evidence rule and the definition of an agreement <span title="467" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-467">p. 467</span>between two parties. Under the U.C.C., an agreement goes beyond the written words on a piece of paper. “ ‘Agreement’ means the bargain of the parties in fact as found in their language or by implication from other circumstances including course of dealing or usage of trade or course of performance as provided in this chapter (sections 490:1-205 and 490:2-208).” Id. §490:1-201(3). Express terms, then, do not constitute the entire agreement, which must be sought also in evidence of usages, dealings, and performance of the contract itself. The purpose of evidence of usages, which are defined in the previous section, is to help to understand the entire agreement. . . . Id. §490:1-205, Comment 4. Course of dealing is more important than usages of the trade, being specific usages between the two parties to the contract. “[C]ourse of dealing controls usage of trade.” Id. §490:1-205(4). It “is a sequence of previous conduct between the parties to a particular transaction which is fairly to be regarded as establishing a common basis of understanding for interpreting their expressions and other conduct.” Id. §490:1-205(1). Much of the evidence of prior dealings between Shell and Nanakuli in negotiating the 1963 contract and in carrying out similar earlier contracts was excluded by the court.</p>
<p id="0361ab5a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A commercial agreement, then, is broader than the written paper and its meaning is to be determined not just by the language used by them in the written contract but “by their action, read and interpreted in the light of commercial practices and other surrounding circumstances. The measure and background for interpretation are set by the commercial context, which may explain and supplement even the language of a formal or final writing.” Id., Comment 1. Performance, usages, and prior dealings are important enough to be admitted always, even for a final and complete agreement; only if they cannot be reasonably reconciled with the express terms of the contract are they not binding on the parties. “The express terms of an agreement and an applicable course of dealing or usage of trade shall be construed wherever reasonable as consistent with each other; but when such construction is unreasonable express terms control both course of dealing and usage of trade and course of dealing controls usage of trade.” Id. §490:1-205(4).</p>
<p id="0361ab5b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of these three, then, [i.e., course of performance, course of dealing, and usage of trade — <span class="epub-small-caps">Eds</span>.] the most important evidence of the agreement of the parties is their actual performance of the contract. Id. The operative definition of course of performance is as follows: “Where the contract for sale involves repeated occasions for performance by either party with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it by the other, any course of performance accepted or acquiesced in without objection shall be relevant to determine the meaning of the agreement.” Id. §490:2-208(1). “Course of dealing . . . is restricted, literally, to a sequence of conduct between the parties previous to the agreement. However, the provisions of the Act on course of performance make it clear that a sequence of conduct after or under the agreement may have equivalent meaning (Section 2-208).” Id. 490:1-205, Comment 2. The importance of evidence of course of performance is explained: “The parties themselves know best what they have meant by their words of agreement and their action under that agreement is the best indication of what that meaning <span title="468" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-468">p. 468</span>was.

If the evidence fails to show a practice is regularly observed, the judge can exclude the evidence because it does not show a course of dealing or usage of trade as defined in the Code. If the members of the trade confirm an actual usage but do not support the assertion that the usage applies to the particular facts in litigation, the judge will exclude evidence of the usage as irrelevant. If the parties used new and different language to convey their agreed intention to abandon the past practice, the court will recognize that practice under the old language is irrelevant to the contract containing the new language and, consequently, will exclude the evidence.</p>

Here the evidence was overwhelming that all suppliers to the asphaltic paving trade price protected customers under the same types of circumstances. Chevron’s contract with H.B. was a similar long-term supply contract between a buyer and seller with very close relations, on a form supplied by the seller, covering sales of asphalt, and setting the price at seller’s posted price, with no mention of price protection.

Similarly, members of a trade may handle a particular subset of commercial transactions in a manner consistent [sic: inconsistent?] with written terms because the writing cannot provide for all variations or contingencies.

<p id="0361d27a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Kirst, supra, at 824. Levie, supra, at 1112, writes, “Astonishing as it will seem to most practicing attorneys, under the Code it will be possible in some cases to use custom to contradict the written agreement. . . . Therefore usage may be used to ‘qualify’ the agreement, which presumably means to ‘cut down’ express terms although not to negate them entirely.” Here, the express price term was “Shell’s Posted Price at time of delivery.” A total negation of that term would be that the buyer was to set the price. It is a less than complete negation of the term that an unstated exception exists at times of price increases, at which times the old price is to be charged, for a certain period or for a specified tonnage, on work already committed at the lower price on nonescalating contracts. Such a usage forms a broad and important exception to the express term, but does not swallow it entirely. Therefore, we hold that, under these particular facts, a reasonable jury could have found that price protection was incorporated into the 1969 agreement between Nanakuli and Shell and that price protection was reasonably consistent with the express term of seller’s posted price at delivery.</p>
<p id="0361d27b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>VIII. <span class="epub-small-caps">Good Faith in Setting Price</span></b></p>
<p id="0361d27c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nanakuli offers an alternative theory why Shell should have offered price protection at the time of the price increases of 1974. Even if price protection was not a term of the agreement, Shell could not have exercised good faith in carrying out its 1969 contract with Nanakuli when it raised its price by $32 effective January 1 in a letter written December 31st and only received on January 4, given the universal practice of advance notice of such an increase in the asphaltic paving trade. The Code provides, “A price to be fixed by the seller or by the buyer means a price for him to fix in good faith,” Haw. Rev. Stat. §490:2-305(2). For a merchant good faith means “the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade.” Id. 490:2-103(1)(b). The comment to Section 2-305 explains, “[I]n the normal case a ‘posted price’ . . . satisfies the good faith requirement.” Id., Comment 3. However, the words “in the normal case” mean that, although a posted price will usually be satisfactory, it will not be so under all circumstances. In addition, the dispute here was not over the amount of the increase — that is, the price that the seller fixed — but over the manner in which that increase was put into effect. It is true that Shell, in order to observe the good faith standards of the trade in 1974, was not bound by the practices of aggregate companies, which did not labor under the same disabilities as did asphalt suppliers in 1974. However, Nanakuli presented evidence that Chevron, in raising its price to $76, gave at least six weeks’ advance notice, in accord with the long-time usage of the asphaltic paving trade. Shell, on the other hand, gave absolutely no notice, from which the jury could have concluded that Shell’s manner of carrying out the price increase of 1974 did not conform to commercially reasonable standards. In both the timing of the announcement and its refusal to protect work already bid at the old price, Shell could be found to have breached the obligation of good faith imposed by the <span title="471" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-471">p. 471</span>Code on all merchants. “Every contract or duty within this chapter imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance or enforcement,” id. §490:1-203, which for merchants entails the observance of commercially reasonable standards of fair dealing in the trade. The Comment to 1-203 reads:</p>

Chevron’s conduct in 1974 offered enough relevant evidence of commercially reasonable standards of fair dealing in the asphalt trade in Hawaii in 1974 for the jury to find that Shell’s failure to give sufficient advance notice and price protect Nanakuli after the imposition of the new price did not conform to good faith dealings in Hawaii at that time.</p>

<p id="0361f992-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case involves specific pricing practices, not an allegation of unfair dealing generally. Our opinion should not be interpreted to permit juries to import price protection or a similarly specific contract term from a concept of good faith that is not based on well-established custom and usage or other objective standards of which the parties had clear notice. Here, evidence of custom and usage regarding price protection in the asphaltic paving trade was not contradicted in major respects, and the jury could find that the parties knew or should have known of the practice at the time of making the contract. In my view, these are necessary predicates for either theory of the case, namely, interpretation of the contract based on the course of its performance or a finding that good faith required the seller to hold the price. With these observations, I concur.</p>

<li class=""><p id="0361f995-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Defining usage of trade and related concepts.</i> In its opinion the court discusses usage of trade, course of dealing, and course of performance. As we saw earlier (Note 5 following the <i>Frigaliment</i> case), the UCC now defines each of those concepts in §1-303. The Restatement contains provisions that are similar to these Code provisions. Restatement (Second) §§222 (trade usage), 223 (course of dealing), and 202(4) (course of performance). How are these concepts different from one another? Which is most important in interpreting a contract? Why?</p>
<span title="472" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-472">p. 472</span></li>
<li class=""><p id="0361f996-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Establishing a relevant trade usage.</i> As <i>Nanakuli</i> indicates, evidence of trade usage is only admissible if the party offering the evidence establishes that the usage exists. What is the burden of proof necessary to establish the existence of a trade usage? Who makes the determination of whether the usage exists? In Duffey v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., 14 F. Supp. 3d 120, 132-133 (S.D.N.Y. 2014), the court held that the plaintiff actor in the “cult classic” movie “Office Space” did not establish a trade usage based on evidence drawn from a few dated, dissimilar cases that would limit the unambiguous contract language granting the production company all merchandising rights “throughout the universe” based on the film images. Once a trade usage is established by showing that it has sufficient regularity of observance in a place or market to justify the expectation that it will be followed, a party in that trade is presumed to be bound by it. See Joseph M. Perillo, Contracts §3.17, at 152 (7th ed. 2014); but see Flower City Painting Contractors, Inc. v. Gumina Constr. Co., 591 F.2d 162 (2d Cir. 1979) (newcomer to painting business not bound by a trade usage that term “units” included not only apartment interiors but exteriors and common buildings as well).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0361f997-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Consistency between trade usage and express terms.</i> Courts are divided on the issue of when evidence of trade usage, course of dealing, or course of performance is admissible. Some courts adopt a restrictive view, holding that such evidence is inadmissible if it appears to contradict the terms of the written agreement between the parties. See, e.g., Southern Concrete Services, Inc. v. Mableton Contractors, Inc., 407 F. Supp. 581 (N.D. Ga. 1975), <i>aff’d per curiam,</i> 569 F.2d 1154 (5th Cir. 1978) (evidence of trade usage showing that quantity term of contract was not binding on either buyer or seller was inadmissible).Other courts have gone to the opposite extreme, holding that such evidence is almost always admissible, even if it appears, as suggested by the <i>Nanakuli</i> court, that the trade usage “cuts down” the express terms. See, e.g., Tigg Corp. v. Dow Corning Corp., 822 F.2d 358 (3d Cir. 1987) (evidence of trade usage admissible to show that agreement should be regarded as contract for buyer’s requirements, despite stated minimums in writing; no requirement that written contract be found ambiguous before such evidence admitted).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="036220a8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>“Careful negation” of trade usage.</i> Comment 2 to UCC §2-202 provides that terms derived from a course of dealing or a usage of trade are deemed to be part of the agreement unless “carefully negated.” Professor Kirst, in an article cited extensively by the court in <i>Nanakuli</i>, argued that mere “boilerplate” language generally negating the effect of trade usage or course of dealing should not be conclusive; to give it that effect would elevate form over the actual intent of the parties. Roger W. Kirst, Usage of Trade and Course of Dealing: Subversion of the UCC Theory, 1977 U. Ill. L.F. 811, 863-868. Professor Kirst would agree, however, that a clause that specifically negates a particular trade usage or course of dealing may be given effect. Compare Allapattah Services, Inc. v. Exxon Corp., 61 F. Supp. 2d 1308 (S.D. Fla. 1999) (typical merger clause does not suffice to negate importance of trade usage and course of dealing) with Madison Indus., Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 581 A.2d 85 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1990) (evidence of trade usage excluded where contract provided in general language that <span title="473" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-473">p. 473</span>no course of dealing, course of performance, or usage of trade should be effective unless in a writing signed by authorized agents of both parties).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="036220a9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The</i> Nanakuli <i>case as an exemplar of “modern” contract law</i>. The <i>Nanakuli</i> case was decided in 1981, a time that can with hindsight be seen as a high-water mark for the kind of “modern” contract law developed over roughly the middle half of the twentieth century. See generally Charles L. Knapp, An Offer You Can’t Revoke, 2004 Wis. L. Rev. 309, 316-319 (listing some characteristics of “modern” contract law). The seeming modern consensus formed by the convergence of UCC Article 2 and the Restatement (Second) of Contracts has since splintered, however, under the dual onslaught of Critical Legal Studies from the left and Law and Economics from the right. Professor DiMatteo has characterized <i>Nanakuli</i> as displaying for the most part an embrace of full “contextualism” — the interpretation and enforcement of contracts in light of the commercial setting of the transaction, the aims of the parties and the real-world context of the case, as advocated by Karl Llewellyn and other legal realists. Larry A. DiMatteo, Reason and Context: A Dual Track Theory of Interpretation, 109 Penn. St. L. Rev. 397, 471-474 (2004). Others have seen in the <i>Nanakuli</i> case an illustration of the kind of “relational” contract law advocated by Ian Macneil. Peter Linzer, Uncontracts: Context, Contorts and the Relational Approach, 1988 Ann. Surv. of Amer. L. 139, 155-160, 182-185.</p></li>

<p id="036220ac-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A &amp; B Tax Preparers, Inc. is a corporation engaged in the nationwide business of preparing state and federal income tax returns. In 2015, Herbert Keynes, a resident of Minneapolis, answered A &amp; B’s advertisement seeking a local manager for its Neville, California office. After investigating Keynes’s background and interviewing him personally, A &amp; B offered Keynes the position of manager of the Neville office. Keynes signed one of the company’s printed forms it uses for hiring managers. (A copy of the contract follows this problem; portions in italic are handwritten.)</p>
<p id="036220ad-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After signing the contract, Keynes resigned his job in Minneapolis and moved to Neville. Over the next several years the Neville office became very successful. Keynes’s share of profits increased from approximately $75,000 in 2016 to over $100,000 for the year ending January 31, 2018.</p>
<p id="036220ae-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In September 2018, Keynes received a letter from A &amp; B in which the company stated that effective February 1, 2019, his percentage of net profits would be reduced from 50 percent to 40 percent. The letter referred to paragraph 6.1 of the policy manual of the company, which provided as follows:</p>

<p id="036220b1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Adams responded that Keynes had received a copy of the policy manual and that he assumed Keynes had read and understood it. Adams also said that considering the growth in profits of the Neville branch, Keynes’s income should continue to increase, even though Keynes would be receiving a lower percentage of the profits. Keynes wasn’t satisfied with these answers and told Adams that he wouldn’t agree to the change. Adams said that Keynes did not have a choice and that if he did not return the letter by October 15, the company would be forced to terminate the agreement.</p>
<p id="036220b2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Keynes ignored Adams’s threats and refused to sign the letter.

The contract also included a statement that “this writing contains the entire agreement of the parties.” In August, Jim discovered that Ann was not sending out bills to customers each week, but instead was sending out bills every two weeks. Jim asked Ann about this practice. Ann responded she was only required to send out bills by Wednesday during weeks that she did mailings, but she was not required to send bills every week. She stated her staff had calculated that it was more efficient to do mailings every other week. Jim has an email from Ann on March 3, 2019, in which she stated, “I will collect your service invoices each Friday and send bills the following week.” Would Jim be likely to succeed in action against Ann for breach of the contract due to her mailing practice?</p>

Hannah alleges that there was also an oral understanding that Clara would receive an additional $500 for removing debris from the old fence and disposing of it at a waste facility. Clara dismantled the old fence and placed it in the center of Hannah’s backyard. When Clara completed the new fence and asked for payment, Hannah asked about removal of the old fence debris. Clara replied that she never committed to the $500 price to remove the old fence and that she is only willing to do so for $1,000. Hannah then refused to pay the $4,000 for the new fence.

Olga was the owner of two homes, a primary home in the capital city and a lakeside cabin on the other side of the state of Adams. Olga owned a car in each location. Olga’s daughter, Enid, graduated from college in June 2018 and decided to live in the cabin for the following year with her college friend, Fay, while the two of them collaborated on a writing project. Olga contacted her automobile insurance company, Acme Insurance, to renew her auto insurance policy for the coming year and to make sure that both Enid and Fay would be fully covered while driving her second car. The Acme agent said that the policy covered friends who were not listed on the policy when driving with Olga’s permission. Olga paid her annual premium on June 10, 2018, and received a new copy of the policy one week later. On April 15, 2019, Fay was involved in an accident while driving Olga’s car. The driver of the other car promptly brought a lawsuit against Olga and Fay for physical injuries and property damage. Olga filed a claim with Acme under her auto policy but Acme denied coverage based on language on page 7 of the 20-page policy which defined a “permissive driver” as “someone other <span title="479" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-479">p. 479</span>than a listed driver who does not regularly drive the auto for more than 30 consecutive days.” Because Fay had driven the car regularly for more than nine months, Acme said that she was not a permissive driver and was not covered. Olga had never read the policy and was not aware of the definition of a “permissive driver.” If the state of Adams has adopted a broad version of the reasonable expectations doctrine, would Olga be likely to succeed in a lawsuit to assert coverage under the policy for Fay’s accident?</p>

On April 15, while touring the house with his realtor, Bob noticed some water stains on the ceiling in an upstairs bedroom. Bob asked Sam, who happened to be present, about the condition of the roof. Sam stated that there had been a leak in the roof but said it was repaired during March 2019. Sam went on to say, “Rest assured that the roof is in good shape.” In fact, the roof actually had not been repaired. On April 21, 2019, Bob signed a five-page, standardized purchase contract for the house which contained a provision which read, “Seller makes no representations concerning the condition of the roof, plumbing, or electrical wiring in the house. Buyer may conduct any inspections of the house that may be desired.” Another paragraph read, “This writing contains the entire agreement of the parties.” Bob took possession of the house on June 2, 2016, and the next day he discovered that the roof was still leaking in the upstairs bedroom when a rainstorm occurred. Would Bob be likely to succeed in an action to rescind the home sales contract?</p>

Two trial judges found the agreement ambiguous, that is, “doubtful or uncertain . . . [or] capable of being understood in two or more possible senses or ways.” Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 77 (1989). Three court of appeals judges, reading the same agreement, found the meaning clear beyond all question. At one time, this court held that if one court found a contract ambiguous and another found it clear, it must be ambiguous. See Federal Ins. Co. v. P.A.T. Homes, Inc., 113 Ariz. 136, 138-39, 547 P.2d 1050, 1052-53 (1976). For obvious reasons, we should discard such doctrine and have done so.

State Farm, however, strenuously argued this very point to the jury, which nevertheless remained unconvinced — a permissible result. Cf. Restatement §203 cmts. a &amp; b. Also, State Farm argues that any uncertainty in the language should be construed against the drafter. This rule, however, is subordinate to the rule that the intent of the parties should govern. <i>Polk,</i> 111 Ariz. at 495, 533 P.2d at 662. In any event, it is the <i>missing</i> language of “bad faith” that makes this agreement unclear. Although Randall drafted the agreement, he alleges that State Farm is responsible for the omission. Thus, it is unclear who, if anyone, the rule should be applied against.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="0361360b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10C4C_2c3aa385-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" id="note-N10C4C_2c3aa385-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">4</a></span>&nbsp;Price protection was practiced in the asphaltic paving trade by either extending the old price for a period of time after a new one went into effect or charging the old price for a specified tonnage, which represented work committed at the old price.

White &amp; Summers, supra §3-3 at 87 (emphasis supplied). “Note particularly [in 1-205(1) &amp; (2)] that it is not necessary for both parties to be consciously aware of the trade usage. It is enough if the trade usage is such as to ‘justify an expectation’ of its observance.” Id. at 84.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="0361ab5c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10D2C_2c3aa385-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" id="note-N10D2C_2c3aa385-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">33</a></span>&nbsp;Section 2-208, much like 1-205, provides “[t]he express terms of the agreement and any such course of performance, as well as any course of dealing and usage of trade, shall be construed whenever reasonable as consistent with each other; but when such construction is unreasonable, express terms shall control course of performance and course of performance shall control both course of dealing and usage of trade (section 490:1-205).” Id. §490:2-208(2).</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="0361ab5e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10D35_2c3aa385-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" id="note-N10D35_2c3aa385-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">34</a></span>&nbsp;“The agreement of the parties includes that part of their bargain found in course of dealing, usage of trade, or course of performance.

That reading, although at odds with the actual wording of the Code, is a realistic reading of what some of the cases allow. A better formulation of the Code’s mandate is offered by R. W. Kirst, Usage of Trade and Course of Dealing: Subversion of the UCC Theory, 1977 [U. Ill.] Law Forum 811:</p>

<p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="0361d272-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56">The need to determine whether the parties intended a usage . . . to be part of the contract does not end if the court finds that the commercial practice is inconsistent with or contradicts the express language of the writing. If an inconsistency exists, the intention of the parties remains unclear. The parties may have intended either to include or exclude the practice. Determining the intent of the parties requires that the court attempt to construe the written term consistently with the commercial practice, if that is reasonable. If consistent construction is unreasonable the Code directs that the written term be taken as expressing the parties’ intent. Before concluding that a jury could not reasonably find a consistent construction, the judge must understand the commercial background of the dispute.</p>

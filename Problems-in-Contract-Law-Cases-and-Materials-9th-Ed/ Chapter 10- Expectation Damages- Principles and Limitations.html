<p id="039f9e4d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Until now, our study has focused for the most part on the process by which contractual agreements are reached, the methods courts use to interpret (and, where appropriate, supplement) those agreements, and the possible justifications for their nonperformance. In this chapter and the next, we address generally the question of what remedies should be available to a party who has been injured by the other party’s unjustified failure to perform her contractual obligation. For this purpose, we will assume a binding contract has been made and that one party has committed an actionable “breach” — unjustified nonperformance — of some duty imposed by that contract. This assumption of breach does not mean that the court necessarily will or should be indifferent to the cause of the nonperformance, as we shall see; it does mean, however, that the party aggrieved by that nonperformance will ordinarily be entitled to some remedy, even if only “nominal damages.” Restatement (Second) §346(2) (“a small sum fixed without regard to the amount of loss”). See MBM Financial Corp. v. The Woodlands Operating Co., L.P., 292 S.W. 3d 660 (Tex. 2009) (nominal damages are awarded for breach when there are no actual damages or none than can be proved; $1, $10, or even $100 may be nominal damages but $1,000 was too much). Except where the plaintiff is seeking some sort of vindication (e.g., the plaintiff in a libel action who has been publicly and wrongly accused of some criminal or unsavory activity), lawsuits are not brought with the aim of recovering merely nominal damages, nor is it likely that any plaintiff would regard such an outcome as anything more than a Pyrrhic victory. Much more interesting and significant, therefore, is the follow-up question: What kinds of remedies are available to give the plaintiff not merely symbolic justice but actual redress for the injury caused by the defendant’s breach?</p>

In the majority of cases arising out of breach of contract, however, specific relief is not at issue because the plaintiff merely seeks (and in any event, would probably only be awarded) money damages. A question of prime importance, then, is the way in which such damages are to be computed.</p>
<p id="039f9e4f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1936 Professor Lon Fuller and his associate William Perdue advanced the thesis that there are three basic interests that the law may seek to protect in fashioning remedies for breach of contract. Their analysis has become the standard exposition of what might be considered the “modern” approach to contract remedies.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="039f9e50-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is convenient to distinguish three principal purposes which may be pursued in awarding contract damages. These purposes, and the situations in which they become appropriate, may be stated briefly as follows:</p>
<p id="039f9e51-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>First,</i> the plaintiff has in reliance on the promise of the defendant conferred some value on the defendant. The defendant fails to perform his promise. The court may force the defendant to disgorge the value he received from the plaintiff. The object here may be termed the prevention of gain by the defaulting promisor at the expense of the promisee; more briefly, the prevention of unjust enrichment. The interest protected may be called the <i>restitution interest.</i> For our present purposes it is quite immaterial how the suit in such a case be classified, whether as contractual or quasi-contractual, whether as a suit to enforce the contract or as a suit based upon a rescission of the contract. These questions relate to the superstructure of the law, not to the basic policies with which we are concerned.</p>
<p id="039f9e52-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Secondly,</i> the plaintiff has in reliance on the promise of the defendant changed his position. For example, the buyer under a contract for the sale of land has incurred expense in the investigation of the seller’s title, or has neglected the opportunity to enter other contracts. We may award damages to the plaintiff for the purpose of undoing the harm which his reliance on the defendant’s promise has caused him. Our object is to put him in as good a position as he was in before the promise was made. The interest protected in this case may be called the <i>reliance interest.</i></p>
<p id="039f9e53-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Thirdly,</i> without insisting on reliance by the promisee or enrichment of the promisor, we may seek to give the promisee the value of the expectancy which the promise created. We may in a suit for specific performance actually compel the defendant to render the promised performance to the plaintiff, or, in a suit for damages, we may make the defendant pay the money value of this performance. Here our object is to put the plaintiff in as good a position as he would have occupied had the defendant performed his promise. The interest protected in this case we may call the <i>expectation interest. . . .</i></p>
<p id="039f9e54-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is obvious that the three “interests” we have distinguished do not present equal claims to judicial intervention. It may be assumed that ordinary standards of justice would regard the need for judicial intervention as decreasing in the order in which we have listed the three interests. The “restitution interest,” involving a combination of unjust impoverishment with unjust gain, presents the strongest case for relief. . . .<span title="875" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-875">p. 875</span></p>
<p id="039f9e55-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, the promisee who has actually relied on the promise, even though he may not thereby have enriched the promisor, certainly presents a more pressing case for relief than the promisee who merely demands satisfaction for his disappointment in not getting what was promised him. . . . It is as a matter of fact no easy thing to explain why the normal rule of contract recovery should be that which measures damages by the value of the promised performance. Since this “normal rule” throws its shadow across our whole subject it will be necessary to examine the possible reasons for its existence.</p>

<p id="039f9e56-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lon L. Fuller &amp; William R. Perdue, Jr., The Reliance Interest in Contract Damages I, 46 Yale L.J. 52, 53-57 (1936).</p>
<p id="039f9e57-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some scholars have questioned the usefulness of Fuller and Perdue’s three interests. See Richard Craswell, Against Fuller and Perdue, 67 U. Chi. L. Rev. 99 (2000); W. David Slawson, Why Expectation Damages for Breach of Contract Must Be the Norm: A Refutation of the Fuller and Perdue “Three Interests” Thesis, 81 Neb. L. Rev. 839 (2003). However, in Restatement (Second) §344, the drafters have adopted the Fuller and Perdue analysis and terminology. As Chapter 11 will demonstrate, both the reliance and restitution interests can be, and often are, a basis for assessing damages against a breaching defendant. It has long been the policy, however, for the court in a breach-of-contract suit to attempt, if possible, to compute and award damages so as to give plaintiff her expectation of gain under the contract: the “benefit of the bargain” that plaintiff would have realized had the agreement been fully performed. See Restatement (Second) §347. This strong preference for expect-ation damages means that an award may be revised on appeal if it appears that the court below has awarded the plaintiff less than the value of her lost expectation. See, e.g., Sampley Enterprises, Inc. v. Laurilla, 404 So. 2d 841 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1981) (error to restrict plaintiff contractor to recovery of out-of-pocket expenses when amount of expected profit on contract with defendant had been proven with sufficient certainty). On the other hand, it may also be reversible error to render judgment for <i>more</i> than the injury to plaintiff’s expectation. See, e.g., Wright v. Stevens, 445 So. 2d 791 (Miss. 1984) (error to award damages of $13,000 based on jury’s verdict for defects in swimming pool construction when evidence only supported recovery of something less than $10,000).</p>
<p id="039f9e58-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this chapter we survey the particular rules by which expectation damages are commonly computed in various types of cases and note some important limitations on such awards. Our discussion below demonstrates that the law is not always as rigid in this regard as the “general rule” might suggest; nevertheless, the rule of expectation damages survives as the stated norm for contract actions. As we proceed, keep in mind two questions raised by this historical preference for protection of the “expectation interest”: Why should the law regard the value of the plaintiff’s lost expectation as the minimum amount that plaintiff should receive as damages for defendant’s breach? Conversely, why should the law regard the value of that lost expectation as the <i>maximum</i> permissible award? In the last section of this chapter, we return to these two questions.<span title="876" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-876">p. 876</span></p>

<p id="039fc56b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As suggested above, the “expectation” that the court seeks to protect in its award of contract damages is the gain the plaintiff would have realized if the contract between plaintiff and defendant had been fully performed, as promised by both parties. Where the plaintiff has fully performed her obligation under the contract and the only unperformed obligation of the defendant is to pay a stated amount of money in return, the injury to the plaintiff’s expectation ordinarily is simply the defendant’s failure to pay the promised sum; that amount (perhaps with interest) is therefore a sufficient award of damages to compensate the injury to the plaintiff’s expectation. (The judgment in such a case is also a kind of “specific performance,” since it orders the defendant to do precisely what he promised.) Where the performance defendant has failed to render is something other than the payment of money (the conveyance of property, perhaps, or the performance of service), it may be more difficult to place a dollar value on the plaintiff’s expectation of gain. The case will be further complicated if the plaintiff’s own performance was incomplete when the defendant’s breach occurred and remains incomplete when the plaintiff’s claim for damages is adjudicated. Because the aim of the law is to put the plaintiff in as good a position as she would have occupied had the contract been fully performed <i>on both sides</i>, the “expectation” to be protected is the plaintiff’s “net” expectation — the value of the performance defendant had promised to render, less the cost of the performance plaintiff had promised in return as the “price” of defendant’s performance.</p>
<p id="039fc56c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In §347 the Restatement (Second) states a formula by which damages based on the injury to the plaintiff’s expectation interest may be computed. In his treatise, Professor Farnsworth (who served as Reporter for the revised Restatement) elaborates on the various components of the Restatement formula.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="039fc56d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>General Measure of Damages.</b> How is the injured party’s expectation to be measured in terms of money? What sum will put the injured party in as good a position as if the contract had been performed? The answer depends on whether the injured party has terminated the contract, refused to render any further return performance, and is claiming damages for total breach or has not terminated, stands ready to perform to render any remaining return performance, and is claiming damages for partial breach.</p>
<p id="039fc56e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>. . .</b></p>
<p id="039fc56f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A claim of damages for total breach may have four elements because the breach may affect an injured party in four ways. . . . </p>
<p id="039fc570-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, the breach may cause the injured party a loss by depriving that party, at least to some extent, of the performance expected under the contract. The difference between the value to the injured party of the performance that should have been received and the value to that party of what, if anything, <span title="877" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-877">p. 877</span>actually was received will be referred to as the <i>loss in value.</i> If, for example, a buyer of goods has a claim for damages for partial breach because the goods were nonconforming, the <i>loss in value</i> equals the difference between the value to the buyer of the goods that were to have been delivered and the value of the goods that were actually delivered. (In addition the Vienna Convention gives a buyer in this situation a right to price reduction, a remedy unknown to the common law, as an alternative to damages for partial breach.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1009F_2c3aca9a-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1009F_2c3aca9a-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">4</a></span>) If the buyer has a claim for damages for total breach because no goods were tendered or goods tendered were not accepted, the <i>loss in value</i> is simply the value to the injured party of the goods that were to have been tendered. . . . In many situations the <i>loss in value</i> depends on the circumstances of the injured party or those of that party’s enterprise. If the injured party’s expected advantage consists of the realization of profit, it may not be difficult to express that party’s <i>loss in value</i> in terms of money. In other situations, such as those involving personal satisfaction, the task may be virtually impossible. . . . </p>
<p id="039fc572-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the breach may cause the injured party loss other than <i>loss in value,</i> and the party is also entitled to recovery for this, subject again to limitations such as that of unforeseeability. Such loss will be referred to as <i>other loss</i> and is sometimes said to give rise to “incidental” and “consequential” damages. Incidental damages include additional costs incurred after the breach in a reasonable attempt to avoid loss, even if the attempt is unsuccessful. If, for example, the injured party who has not received the promised performance pays a fee to a broker in a reasonable but unsuccessful attempt to obtain a substitute, that expense is recoverable. Consequential damages include such items as injury to person or property caused by the breach. If, for example, services furnished to the injured party are defective and cause damage to that party’s property, that loss is recoverable. The terms used to characterize the loss should not, however, be critical, for the general principle is that all loss, however characterized, is recoverable.</p>
<p id="039fc573-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What has been said in the two preceding paragraphs applies regardless of whether or not the injured party chooses to treat the breach as total. It applies to both claims for partial breach and claims for total breach. If the injured party does terminate the contract, however, the breach may have a third or fourth effect, because that party is relieved of the duty of rendering whatever remains of its own performance. What is said in the two following paragraphs applies only to claims for total breach.</p>
<p id="039fc574-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, then, if the injured party terminates and claims damages for total breach, the breach may have a beneficial effect on that party by saving it the further expenditure that would otherwise have been incurred. This saving will be referred to as <i>cost avoided.</i> If, for example, the injured party is a builder that stops work after terminating a construction contract because of the owner’s breach, the additional expenditure the builder saves is <i>cost avoided.</i></p>
<p id="039fec85-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fourth, if the injured party terminates and claims damages for total breach, the breach may have a further beneficial effect on that party by allowing it to avoid some loss by salvaging and reallocating some or all of the resources that otherwise it would have had to devote to performance of the contract. <span title="878" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-878">p. 878</span>The saving that results will be referred to as <i>loss avoided.</i> If, for example, the injured party is a builder that, after stopping work after terminating a construction contract, uses some of the leftover materials on another contract, the resulting saving to the builder is <i>loss avoided.</i> Or if the injured party is an employee who, after being wrongfully discharged by an employer, takes other employment, the net amount that has been earned or will be earned from that employment is <i>loss avoided.</i> If the injured party has actually saved money, the saving is treated as <i>loss avoided</i> even though another person might not have been able to effect that saving. If, for example, the injured party happens to make especially favorable arrangements to dispose of leftover materials, and thereby avoids more loss than another person might have succeeded in doing, the <i>loss avoided</i> will be based on the actual favorable arrangements. . . . </p>
<p id="039fec86-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The general measure of damages for total breach can therefore be expressed in terms of these four effects, two of which (<i>loss in value</i> and <i>other loss</i>) are adverse to the injured party and therefore increase damages, and two of which (<i>cost avoided</i> and <i>loss avoided</i>) are beneficial to the injured party and therefore decrease that party’s damages. Formula (A) therefore reads:</p>

<p id="039fec87-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(A) <i>general measure = loss in value + other loss − cost avoided − loss avoided</i></p>

<p id="039fec8a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Using Professor Farnsworth’s formula, how would you compute the plaintiff’s expectation damages in the following hypothetical cases:</p>
<p id="039fec8b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Case 1.</i> Owner hires builder to construct a building for a total price of $200,000. The estimated total cost of construction is $180,000. The owner breaches by unjustifiably terminating the contract when the work is partly done. At the time of termination the owner has paid the builder $70,000 for work done, and the builder has spent a total of $95,000 for labor and materials (some of which are incorporated in the partially completed building). After the owner’s breach the builder is able to resell $10,000 of materials purchased for the project.</p>
<p id="039fec8c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Case 2.</i> Employer hires employee under a two-year employment contract for a salary of $50,000 per year, payable in installments at the end of each month. Six months after the employee starts work, the employer wrongfully discharges her. The employee looks for work for three months, but is unable to find a job. Finally, she hires an employment agency, paying it a fee of $1,000. Three months later she obtains a job (similar to the one from which she was fired) paying $45,000 per year.</p>
<p id="039fec8d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this chapter we try generally to use the terminology employed in Restatement (Second) §347 to describe the process by which the plaintiff’s damages are computed. It should be noted, however, that the computation of expectation damages may be articulated in different ways, although the end results should be identical. For example, in contracts for the sale of real estate, courts often state that expectation damages are measured by the <i>difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of breach.</i> In construction contracts, the measure of expectation damages for a breach by the owner is frequently stated to be the builder’s <i>expected <span title="879" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-879">p. 879</span>net profit on the entire contract plus the builder’s unreimbursed expenses at the time of breach.</i> In the material that follows we will consider these and other alternative statements of the expectation damage measure.</p>
<p id="039fec8e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Case 3.</i> Compute the builder’s expectation damages in Case 1, using the formula of expected net profit on the entire contract plus unreimbursed expenses at the time of breach.</p>
<p id="039fec8f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The formula of Restatement (Second) §347, while not without its problems in application, works relatively easily in cases where the party in breach is the “paying” party: the one whose promised performance was to consist of one or more payments of money. Thus, where the plaintiff is a wrongfully discharged employee, the first factor, “loss in value,” will simply be the excess of salary originally promised over the salary actually paid. Where the defendant is the defaulting buyer of property, the “loss in value” will be the difference between the amount the purchaser promised to pay and the amount (if any) the vendor has actually received. It should not be assumed, of course, that this calculation fixes the amount of the plaintiff’s damage, as the rest of the Restatement’s formula indicates. In any of these cases, there may in addition be items of “consequential” loss (sometimes referred to as “special” damages); on the other hand, from the aggregate of “total loss” there are likely to be deductions based on the amounts that plaintiff saved (or reasonably should have saved) either as costs avoided or by operation of the principle of “mitigation of damages” (discussed later in this chapter).</p>
<p id="039fec90-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where the defendant’s promised performance is to be something other than payment of money, however, the threshold question of loss in value is not so easily answered. Suppose, in Case 1 above, that the breaching party is not the owner, but the builder. If the builder repudiates before construction even begins, then the owner has received no performance at all; how should we compute his loss in value? Is it simply an amount equal to the full contract price? Or should we somehow attempt to put a “value” on the building that was to be constructed? If performance has begun, and the builder unjustifiably stops work halfway through, the situation is even more complicated: How can we put a price tag on the half-completed building that the owner has received? The same question may arise where an employee has rendered part of the service called for by a contract and then wrongfully stops performance. If the loss in value is the difference in value between what was promised and what was performed, how can those two be computed? The cases that follow illustrate some of the approaches that may be used in such cases.</p>

James Hamilton, through his real estate agent Kent Eastman of Pro 100 Realty,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1017E_2c3aca9a-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1017E_2c3aca9a-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">1</a></span> then offered to purchase the property for $290,000, and this offer was accepted on May 17, 2003. Hamilton thereafter assigned his interest in the contract to Paragon Ventures, L.L.C. (“Paragon”), a business that Hamilton and Richard Worley set up to operate a restaurant. Hamilton also remained as an individual buyer on the contract. Hamilton and Paragon are hereinafter referred to collectively as “Buyers.”</p>
<p id="03a013b0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The contract contained the following financing contingency provision:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03a013b1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This contract is contingent on Buyer’s [sic] ability to obtain a conventional loan or loans in the amount of $232,000, payable over a period of not less than <span title="881" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-881">p. 881</span>15 years and bearing interest at a rate of not more than 5.5% per annum. Seller shall not be obligated to pay any of the expenses incidental to the obtaining of such loan or loans. Buyer shall use reasonable diligence in seeking to obtain such loan or loans, and if Buyer does not furnish seller with a copy of an effective written loan commitment within 30 days from the Effective Date, then this Contract shall automatically terminate and the Earnest Money shall be returned to Buyer.</p>
</div>
<p id="03a013b2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Buyers never furnished Seller with a copy of an effective written loan commitment within 30 days of the effective date of the contract.</p>
<p id="03a013b3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After entering into the contract on May 17, 2003, Buyers made arrangements for financing at the Bank of Joplin. Buyers applied for and were approved by the bank for a loan in the amount of $340,000.00. The bank agreed to loan them $225,000.00 amortized over fifteen years on the real estate, $65,000.00 amortized over seven years on the equipment, and a $50,000.00 revolving line of credit all at the rate of interest of prime plus 1.5%. Buyers did not apply for a loan with any other financial institution.</p>
<p id="03a03ac4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On June 10, 2003, Buyers’ real estate agent was furnished a title insurance commitment from Jasper County Title showing sales tax liens attached to the property.</p>
<p id="03a03ac5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The contract originally specified a June 30, 2003 closing date. Following an inspection of the property, certain repairs were made, and an appraisal was performed as a requirement of the financing by Bank of Joplin. As a result of some appraisal requirements, the parties, on a date not disclosed by the record, entered into an agreement extending the closing date to July 14, 2003. Following this extension, the parties discussed other additional repairs and this led to an agreement whereby Buyers would receive a credit of $1,373.54 against the purchase price in lieu of additional repairs being made.</p>
<p id="03a03ac6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By a second extension agreement dated July 18, 2003, the closing date was again extended, this time to August 1, 2003. On that same date the parties also entered into an agreement that allowed Buyers to take possession of the property prior to closing so that they could start cleaning it. Also around this same time period, Buyers made application for appropriate licenses to operate a restaurant on the property and had the utilities for the property transferred into Buyers’ name.</p>
<p id="03a03ac7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nothing in any of the subsequent agreements entered into between the parties altered any of the terms of the financing contingency contained in the original contract.</p>
<p id="03a03ac8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Immediately prior to July 30, 2003, all documentation was in place at the title company and ready for closing on August 1, 2003. Financing was in place from the Bank of Joplin. All parties were ready to close. The tax liens, mentioned in the title commitment provided to Buyers, were satisfied on the morning of August 1, as contemplated by the July 18 extension agreement between the parties, and Sellers obtained a certificate of “No Sales Tax Due” from the state. U.S. Bank (Seller’s lender) had agreed to accept $266,000.00 to apply on Sellers’ indebtedness and release its lien on the property. According to the closing statement prepared by the realtor, after payment of mortgages, real <span title="882" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-882">p. 882</span>estate taxes, and liens, Seller was to receive a cash balance of $1,757.72 when the transaction closed.</p>
<p id="03a03ac9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On July 30, 2003, Buyers sent a letter to the realtor and Seller stating their intention not to close the transaction. In this letter, Buyers claimed “items, which we consider fixtures, have been taken from the premises.” This missing property consisted of two used televisions, a couple of mirrors, a set of stereo speakers, and a computerized cash register. These items were not part of the list of personal property that was to be transferred in the sale, which was itemized and attached to the contract. This letter also specified the existence of the tax liens as an additional reason for Buyers’ refusal to close the transaction as scheduled. Buyers made no mention of any inability to obtain satisfactory financing. Buyers failed to appear for closing as scheduled on August 1, 2003.</p>
<p id="03a03aca-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On August 5, 2003, Paragon offered to buy a building at 520 Main Street in Joplin, Missouri, for the purpose of establishing a restaurant. This offer was accepted by those sellers on August 6, 2003 and closed September 22, 2003. The purchase price for that property was $170,000.00.</p>
<p id="03a03acb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After Buyers refused to close the sale with Seller on August 1, 2003, Seller’s realtor continuously tried to sell the property. However, no offers were received until May of 2004, when J and A Cafe of Kansas, L.L.C., offered to purchase the property for $235,000.00. Sellers accepted this offer, and the transaction closed on July 15, 2004.</p>
<p id="03a03acc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Seller thereafter filed suit against Buyers for breach of contract. As part of its damages, Seller claimed the difference in sales price between Buyers’ $290,000 contract price which should have closed on August 1, 2003, and the $235,000 price actually obtained when the property subsequently sold eleven and one-half months later on July 15, 2004. Seller also claimed real estate and personal property taxes, utilities, and mortgage interest accruing during that period as damages.</p>
<p id="03a03acd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court entered judgment in favor of Seller and against Buyers in the total amount of $95,547.30. Buyers timely appeal this judgment.</p>
<p id="03a03ace-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Additional facts will hereinafter be disclosed as needed to appropriately discuss Buyers’ points relied on.</p>
<p id="03a03acf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>DISCUSSION</b></p>
<p id="03a03ad0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b><span class="epub-small-caps">Buyers Waived the Financing Contingency</span></b></p>
<p id="03a03ad1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Buyers’ first point claims that the trial court erred in finding they breached the contract, “because the contract terminated pursuant to its own financing contingency provision when [Buyers] could not obtain financing.” Buyers initially argue that as a matter of law they could not have breached the contract by refusing to close on August 1, 2003, because by its explicit terms the contract automatically terminated when Buyers did not “furnish Seller with a copy of an effective written loan commitment,” as required by the financing contingency <span title="883" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-883">p. 883</span>provision in the contract. Buyers alternatively argue that “if the trial court’s judgment rests on an implicit finding that the contract had not automatically terminated under the financing contingency provision, then the trial court erred in interpreting the term ‘reasonable diligence’ and finding that the defendants had not used such diligence in finding a loan.” Seller counters Buyers’ point, contending that Buyers, by their conduct after entering into the contract, waived the financing contingency provisions in the contract.</p>
<p id="03a061e2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“A provision in a real estate contract that makes the contract contingent upon the buyer’s obtaining financing is a condition.” Howard v. Youngman, 81 S.W.3d 101, 110 (Mo. App. 2002). Because such conditions are meant to protect the buyer, they are a condition of the buyer’s duty, but not a condition of the seller’s duty under the contract. Id. “[I]n a real estate contract containing a contingency clause, upon the nonoccurrence of the condition (i.e., the buyers obtaining financing), the buyer is <i>ipso facto</i> excused from performance.” Id. However, “the buyer can elect to waive the contingency and proceed with the contract under the rule that a party may waive any condition of a contract in that party’s favor.” Id.</p>
<p id="03a061e3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Parties to an agreement may by their oral agreement or their conduct waive the provisions of a contract between them. This doctrine applies equally to provisions requiring written communications.” Pilla v. Estate of Pilla, 689 S.W.2d 727, 730 (Mo. App. 1985).</p>
<p id="03a061e4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Waiver of rights under a contract has been defined as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03a061e5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Waiver” has been defined as an intentional relinquishment of a known right, on the question of which intention of the party charged with waiver is controlling and, if not shown by express declarations but implied by conduct, there must be a clear, unequivocal, and decisive act of party showing such purpose, and so consistent with intention to waive that no other reasonable explanation is possible.</p>
</div>
<p id="03a061e6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Keltner v. Sowell, 926 S.W.2d 528, 531 (Mo. App. 1996). . . . </p>
<p id="03a061e7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The contract in the instant case defines its Effective Date as “the date and time of final acceptance on the signature page.” Seller finally accepted the contract by signing the signature page on May 17, 2003. Thus, the effective date of the contract was May 17, 2003. The financing contingency in paragraph five of the contract provided: “if Buyer does not furnish Seller with a copy of an effective written loan commitment within 30 days from the Effective Date, then this Contract shall automatically terminate and the Earnest Money shall be returned to Buyer.” . . . Yet, Buyers’ actions after that date were inconsistent with such a termination.</p>
<p id="03a061e8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On July 17, 2003, a month after the contract supposedly automatically terminated, Buyers executed a written amendment to the contract extending the closing date from July 14, 2003 to August 1, 2003. This amendment additionally provided for the assignment of the contract to Paragon as a buyer in addition to Hamilton and for a $1,373.54 credit against the purchase price in exchange for Buyers releasing Seller from any obligation to perform any further repairs to <span title="884" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-884">p. 884</span>the property. Finally this amendment provided: “IT IS UNDERSTOOD BY ALL PARTIES THAT ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE CONTRACT REMAIN UNCHANGED.” Buyers entered into this amendment with the intention of closing the contract on August 1, 2003.</p>
<p id="03a061e9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Also on July 17, 2003, Buyers executed an “Agreement for Possession Prior to Closing — Contract Rider,” which granted them the right to take possession of the property as a tenant on July 21, 2003. This agreement provided that “this Rider shall become a part of the Contract” and “[p]ossession is for the sole purpose of cleaning only.” To effectuate their possession, Buyers accepted a key to the property from Seller. During this time period, Buyers had the utilities to the property switched over and put in their name. Also during this time, and as late as July 25, 2003, Buyers were in the process of securing appropriate licenses to operate their restaurant on the property after closing. . . . </p>
<p id="03a061ea-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nevertheless, Buyers argue that, regardless of their waiver of the automatic termination provision in the financing contingency, their inability to obtain financing on the terms otherwise set forth in the financing contingency relieved them of their obligations under the contract. However, Seller counters that Buyers’ conduct evidenced a clear and unequivocal intention to waive all of the financing terms in the financing contingency.</p>
<p id="03a061eb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Initially, there is no evidence in the record that Buyers ever made any application for a loan “in the amount of $232,000, payable over a period of not less than 15 years and bearing interest at a rate of not more than 5.5% per annum,” as provided in the financing contingency. Chris Crouch, the loan officer at Bank of Joplin testified that Buyers applied for a loan in the amount of $340,000.00. Other than this one application, Buyers did not apply for any other loans. Failing to seek a loan on the terms set forth in the financing contingency evidences Buyers’ failure to use reasonable diligence to obtain such financing as required by the contingency. Goldberg v. Charlie’s Chevrolet, Inc., 672 S.W.2d 177, 179 (Mo. App. 1984). We need not address that issue, however, because such action, coupled with Buyers’ conduct on July 17, 2003, and thereafter, also evidences Buyers’ waiver of the entire financing contingency. . . . </p>
<p id="03a061ec-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All of these actions by Buyers are clear, unequivocal, and decisive acts showing Buyers’ intentional relinquishment of the benefit of the entire financing contingency, and are so consistent with the intention to waive that contingency that no other reasonable explanation is possible. . . . Point I is denied.</p>
<p id="03a061ed-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b><span class="epub-small-caps">The Trial Court’s Determination of Fair Market Value is Supported by Substantial Evidence</span></b></p>
<p id="03a061ee-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Buyers’ second point claims that the trial court’s judgment is not supported by substantial evidence of the fair market value of the property as of the date the contract was breached by the Buyers — August 1, 2003 — in that Seller did not offer any direct evidence of the fair market value of the property on that date. Buyers contend that the actual sale price of $235,000.00 received by Seller on July 15, 2004, is not substantial evidence of the fair market value of the property on August 1, 2003 for two reasons: first, being eleven and one-half <span title="885" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-885">p. 885</span>months after the relevant date, it is too remote in time; and, second, it was the product of a distress sale in that the Seller was compelled to sell the property in that transaction. We disagree with both contentions.</p>
<p id="03a088ff-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A seller’s measure of damages for a buyer’s breach of a contract for the sale of land with a structure on it is the difference between the purchase price and the fair market value of the property on the date of breach. Wooten v. DeMean, 788 S.W.2d 522, 527-528 (Mo. App. 1990). That is, the measure of damages is the difference between the contract price and the fair market value of the property on the date the sale should have been completed. Leonard v. American Walnut Co., Inc., 609 S.W.2d 452, 455 (Mo. App. 1980). “An essential element of the seller’s case is proof of market value, and if he does resell within a reasonable time after the breach, the price obtained is some evidence of market value.” Id. Conflicts in the evidence concerning real estate values are for resolution by the fact finder. State ex rel. Kansas City Power &amp; Light Co. v. Salmark Homebuilders, Inc., 375 S.W.2d 92, 100 (Mo. 1964). It is sufficient if the value set by the fact finder is “within the range” of the evidence. City of Lee’s Summit v. Hinck, 618 S.W.2d 719, 721 (Mo. App. 1981).</p>
<p id="03a08900-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While Buyers acknowledge that the sale price received by a seller from a subsequent sale of the property is substantial evidence to support a trial court’s determination of the fair market value of a property as of the date of the breach if the subsequent sale occurs within a reasonable time after the date of the breach, they claim that a sale eleven and one-half months after the breach, as occurred in this case, is not within a reasonable period of time as a matter of law. Buyers cite no Missouri cases supporting their contention. They cite only Chris v. Epstein, 113 N.C. App. 751, 440 S.E.2d 581 (N.C. App. 1994), for the proposition that a resale of realty that occurred an entire year after the contract breach was not only not representative of fair market value a year earlier, but irrelevant.</p>
<p id="03a08901-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Seller points us to Hawkins v. Foster, 897 S.W.2d 80 (Mo. App. 1995), where we held that the price obtained in a subsequent sale which occurred a little over eleven and one-half months after the date of the buyer’s breach of a real estate contract supported an award of damages in favor of the seller based upon the fair market value of the property. Buyers have failed to distinguish how the time period approved by us in <i>Hawkins</i> materially differs from the essentially same time period in the instant case. Thus, Buyers have not convinced us that we should depart from our holding in <i>Hawkins</i>. Based upon that holding, the subsequent sale by Seller in the case at bar on July 15, 2004, occurred within a reasonable time after the date of Buyers’ breach of the contract, such that it provided substantial evidence to support the trial court’s determination of the fair market value of the property on the date of Buyer’s breach of the contract. See also Hoelscher v. Schenewerk, 804 S.W.2d 828 (Mo. App. 1991) (subsequent sale approximately nine months after date of breach).</p>
<p id="03a08902-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Buyers next contend that the subsequent sale price received by Seller is not substantial evidence of the fair market value of the property as of the date of the breach because the subsequent sale was a distress sale in that Seller was <span title="886" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-886">p. 886</span>“compelled” to sell the property. Buyers claim that because fair market value is defined as “the price which property will bring when it is offered for sale by an owner who is willing but <i>under no compulsion to sell</i> and is bought by a buyer who is willing or desires to purchase but is not compelled to do so[,]” Turner v. Shalberg, 70 S.W.3d 653, 659 (Mo. App. 2002) (quoting Carter v. Matthey Laundry &amp; Dry Cleaning Co., 350 S.W.2d 786, 794 (Mo. 1961)) (emphasis added), and because Seller was compelled to sell the property, then the sale price could not, by definition, reflect the fair market value of the property. The flaw in Buyers’ argument is that the evidence they cite in support of their claim does not exist.</p>
<p id="03a08903-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Buyers direct us to the testimony of Carolyn Billingsly, one of Seller’s owners, to support their contention. Buyers’ trial counsel asked Billingsly: “And so, you were compelled to sell it, I mean, you wanted to sell it bad; true?” She responded: “We did.” Counsel’s question was a compound question — “you were compelled to sell it” and “you wanted to sell it bad.” The wording of her response — “We did” — corresponded to the latter question and not the former. If she had been responding to the first question, her answer would have been in the form “We were.” Thus, while Billingsly’s testimony supports that Seller wanted badly to sell the property at the time of the subsequent sale, it does not support that Seller was compelled to do so.</p>
<p id="03a08904-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Buyers fail to cite to any authority for the proposition that a sale in which the seller is highly motivated or badly wants to sell, as opposed to being compelled to sell, eliminates that sale from being considered as a fair market value sale of the property. Their reliance on <i>Carter</i>, 350 S.W.2d 786, is misplaced. In <i>Carter</i>, the sale was made pursuant to a plan of liquidation which had to be completed within a one-year period under a provision of the tax code, and, in addition, the property was under the threat of condemnation which would have compelled a forced sale. Id. at 794. While Seller here was financially motivated to sell and was highly desirous of selling the property at the time of the subsequent sale, it was not compelled to sell as was the seller in <i>Carter</i>.</p>

<li class=""><p id="03a0b01b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Measure of damages for breach of real estate contracts</i>. Assuming that the seller or purchaser has proved a breach of a land sale contract, how should such damages be computed to protect the plaintiff’s expectation interest? As stated in the <i>Crabby’s</i> opinion, damages for the loss of bargain in such cases are ordinarily calculated as the difference between the contract price and the <span title="887" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-887">p. 887</span>market value of the property at the time of breach. Thus, where the seller claims damages for the purchaser’s wrongful repudiation, she must show that at the time of the breach the property was in fact worth less (on the market) than the contract price. See, e.g., Lawson v. Menefee, 132 S.W.3d 890 (Ky. Ct. App. 2004) (contract price was $265,000 and market value was $274,000, based on resale price as best evidence, thus seller suffered no damages). Conversely, when it is the seller who has breached, the disappointed purchaser must show that at the time of breach the property had a market value of <i>more</i> than the contract price. See, e.g., Horning v. Shilberg, 29 Cal. Rptr. 3d 717 (Ct. App. 2005) (nonbreaching buyer entitled to damages based on “contract price-market value” differential but failed to present evidence of value on date set for performance). Moreover, in many cases the contract price and market value at the time of the breach will be reasonably close or perhaps the same. See the <i>Lawson</i> case above. Why would this equivalence in contract and market prices often be the case?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03a0b01c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Waiver of express condition</i>. The buyers in <i>Crabby’s</i> attempted to justify their failure to complete the purchase of property on two theories. First, in a letter of repudiation the buyers made claims that the sellers committed a prior breach of the contract by improperly removing property from the restaurant building or by allowing tax liens to exist on the property. Those claims seemed to be abandoned by the time of the appeal. Second, the buyers asserted that an express condition — the “financing contingency” — was not satisfied and that resulted in discharge of the contract. Is the court’s conclusion that the buyers waived the financing contingency consistent with the discussion of express conditions and excuses for noncompliance found in the <i>enXco</i> case and the accompanying notes in Chapter 9?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03a0b01d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Proof of market value</i>. The contract price minus market value formula requires proof of market value. Real estate appraisers or others who are qualified by education, training, or experience can provide testimony about market value. Courts also usually allow the owner of property to testify about its market value even though the owner may not be qualified as an expert on real estate values. See RWH Homebuilders, L.P. v. Black Diamond Dev. LLP, 2015 Tex. App. LEXIS 8876 (Tex. Ct. App.) (recognizing the owner-opinion rule but requiring owner to provide factual basis for opinion). Can you think of any disadvantage to using an owner’s testimony rather than that of a real estate expert?</p>
<p id="03a0b01e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As in <i>Crabby’s</i>, many courts have also allowed the resale price of the property as evidence of its market value at the time of the breach, provided the resale takes place within a reasonable period of time in an arm’s length transaction. See, e.g., Kemp v. Gannett, 365 N.E.2d 1112 (Ill. 1977). The court in <i>Crabby’s</i> rejects the argument that a resale taking place eleven and one-half months after breach is too remote to be evidence of the value at the time set for closing. In contrast, a later Texas appellate court decision expressed concern that a resale coming more than one year after breach might not be sufficient evidence of the value at the time for closing, especially in light of the upheaval <span title="888" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-888">p. 888</span>in the United States housing market that began in 2008. Barry v. Jackson, 309 S.W.3d 135, 141 (Tex. App. 2010). The Texas court emphasized that the burden of proof was on the plaintiff-seller to establish that the price obtained a year later was within a reasonable time and therefore effective evidence of value at the time of breach.

<li class=""><p id="03a0b01f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>English and American rules when seller breaches</i>. As indicated above, the “benefit of the bargain” rule of damages could be applied equally to cases of breach by the purchaser and to cases where the seller is the breaching party. Where the seller is in breach, however, many courts have traditionally restricted the plaintiff purchaser to restitution of any payments made on the purchase price, unless the defendant seller has breached in “bad faith.” This rule, known as the “English rule,” appears to have grown up at a time when searching land titles was an extremely difficult process, and a seller frequently contracted to sell in ignorance of some later-discovered “cloud” on title, which prevented him from conveying the good (or “marketable”) title called for by the contract. See In re Std. Jury Instructions-Contract &amp; Bus. Cases, 116 So. 3d 284 (Fla. 2013) (Florida has long recognized the English rule).</p>
<p id="03a0b020-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The competing “American rule” would generally award expectation damages for any unexcused failure to convey, regardless of the good faith or bad faith of the seller. The English rule has been generally criticized by American commentators, and the American rule appears to be gaining adherents. See, Donovan v. Bachstadt, 453 A.2d 160 (N.J. 1982). The latter rule is of course in line with the traditional general rule of contract law that unless the cause of nonperformance falls within one of the recognized categories of legal excuse, an expectation-based remedy will normally be available. On the other hand, the English rule does have the potentially attractive feature of adjusting the remedy for breach in light of the willfulness of the breaching party, an approach that some modern commentators have advocated. See Steve Thel &amp; Peter Siegelman, Willfulness Versus Expectation: A Promisor-Based Defense of Willful Breach Doctrine, 107 Mich. L. Rev. 1517 (2009).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03a0b021-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Consequential damages</i>. Of course, the contract/market differential is not the exclusive measure of damages for breach of a land sale contract; an aggrieved plaintiff (buyer or seller) may seek damages based on injuries to her reliance or restitution interests, as discussed above. The Father’s House Internat’l, Inc., v. Kurguz, 71 N.E.3d 711, 718-719 (Ohio Ct. App. 2016). (Both of these types of damages are discussed in Chapter 11.) Plaintiff may also seek “incidental damages” as part of a recovery of expectation damages. In the <i>Crabby’s</i> case, based on the award to the seller of more than $95,000 in total damages, it is apparent that the trial court allowed the seller to recover “other losses” beyond the difference in contract price and fair market value (about $55,000). The appellate court states that the seller sought recovery for “real estate and personal property taxes, utilities, and mortgage interest” accruing during the time between the buyers’ breach and the resale of the property eleven and one-half months later. Such damages are often labeled as “consequential” or “incidental” damages and are subject to certain requirements and limitations, including:</p>

<li class=""><p id="03a0b026-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>UCC damage rules.</i> Damages for breach of a contract to buy or sell goods under the UCC may also be measured by the difference between the market price and the contract price of the goods. UCC §2-708(1) measures the seller’s damages for nonacceptance or repudiation by buyer as “the difference between the market price at the time and place for tender and the unpaid contract price together with any incidental damages provided in this Article (§2-710), but less expenses saved in consequence of the buyer’s breach.” Similarly, UCC §2-713 provides that the measure of the buyer’s damages for nondelivery or repudiation by the seller is “the difference between the market price at the time when the buyer learned of the breach and the contract price together with any incidental and consequential damages provided in this Article (§2-715), but less expenses saved in consequence of the seller’s breach.” The UCC provides some flexibility on proof of market price. See §2-723.</p>
<p id="03a0b027-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The drafters of the Code thought, however, that application of the market measure of damages often did not accurately determine the loss suffered because the reaction of the nonbreaching party will often involve making a substitute contract that may be at a price other than the market value. In the case of breach by the buyer, UCC §2-706 provides for “seller’s resale.” That section allows the seller who complies with its provisions to recover from a breaching buyer damages measured by the difference between the contract price and the seller’s resale price. Similarly, in the case of breach by the seller, UCC §2-712(1) allows the buyer to “cover” her loss by purchasing substitute goods and to measure her damages by the difference between the cost of those goods and the contract price. Section E of this chapter further explores these rules along with other remedies available to buyers and sellers under the UCC.</p></li>

<p id="03a0d73e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This review arises out of an unpublished decision of the court of appeals which affirmed in part and reversed in part a judgment of the Ozaukee county circuit court, Judge Warren A. Grady.</p>
<p id="03a0d73f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="890" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-890">p. 890</span>In January of 1978 the Handicapped Children’s Education Board (the Board) hired Elaine Lukaszewski to serve as a speech and language therapist for the spring term. Lukaszewski was assigned to the Lightfoot School in Sheboygan Falls which was approximately 45 miles from her home in Mequon. Rather than move, she commuted to work each day. During the 1978 spring term, the Board offered Lukaszewski a contract to continue in her present position at Lightfoot School for the 1978-79 school year. The contract called for an annual salary of $10,760. Lukaszewski accepted.</p>
<p id="03a0d740-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In August of 1978, prior to the beginning of the school year, Lukaszewski was offered a position by the Wee Care Day Care Center which was located not far from her home in Mequon. The job paid an annual salary of $13,000. After deciding to accept this offer, Lukaszewski notified Thomas Morrelle, the Board’s director of special education, that she intended to resign from her position at the Lightfoot School. Morrelle told her to submit a letter of resignation for consideration by the Board. She did so, and the matter was discussed at a meeting of the Board on August 21, 1978. The Board refused to release Lukaszewski from her contract. On August 24, 1978, the Board’s attorney sent a letter to Lukaszewski directing her to return to work. The attorney sent a second letter to the Wee Care Day Care Center stating that the Board would take legal action if the Center interfered with Lukaszewski’s performance of her contractual obligations at the Lightfoot School. A copy of this letter was sent to the Department of Public Instruction.</p>
<p id="03a0d741-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lukaszewski left the Wee Care Day Care Center and returned to Lightfoot School for the 1978 fall term. She resented the actions of the Board, however, and retained misgivings about her job. On September 8, 1978, she discussed her feelings with Morrelle. After this meeting Lukaszewski felt quite upset about the situation. She called her doctor to make an appointment for that afternoon and subsequently left the school.</p>
<p id="03a0d742-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dr. Ashok Chatterjee examined Lukaszewski and found her blood pressure to be high. Lukaszewski asked Dr. Chatterjee to write a letter explaining his medical findings and the advice he had given her. In a letter dated September 11, 1978, Dr. Chatterjee indicated that Lukaszewski had a hypertension problem dating back to 1976. He reported that on the day he examined Lukaszewski she appeared agitated, nervous, and had blood pressure readings up to 180/100. It was his opinion that, although she took hypotensive drugs, her medical condition would not improve unless the situation which caused the problem was removed. He further opined that it would be dangerous for her to drive long distances in her agitated state.</p>
<p id="03a0d743-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lukaszewski did not return to work after leaving on September 8, 1978. She submitted a letter of resignation dated September 13, 1978, in which she wrote:</p>

<p id="03a0d745-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A short time later Lukaszewski reapplied for and obtained employment at the Wee Care Day Care Center.</p>
<p id="03a0d746-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After Lukaszewski left, the Board immediately began looking for a replacement. Only one qualified person applied for the position. Although this applicant had less of an educational background than Lukaszewski, she had more teaching experience. Under the salary schedule agreed upon by the Board and the teachers’ union, this applicant would have to be paid $1,026.64 more per year than Lukaszewski. Having no alternative, the Board hired the applicant at the higher salary.</p>
<p id="03a0d747-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In December of 1978 the Board initiated an action against Lukaszewski for breach of contract. The Board alleged that, as a result of the breach, it suffered damage in the amount of the additional compensation it was required to pay Lukaszewski’s replacement for the 1978-79 school year ($1,026.64). A trial was held before the court. The trial court ruled that Lukaszewski had breached her contract and awarded the Board $1,249.14 in damages ($1,026.64 for breach of contract and $222.50 for costs).</p>
<p id="03a0d748-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lukaszewski appealed. The court of appeals affirmed the circuit court’s determination that Lukaszewski breached her contract. However, the appellate court reversed the circuit court’s damage award, reasoning that, although the Board had to pay more for Lukaszewski’s replacement, by its own standards it obtained a proportionately more valuable teacher. Therefore, the court of appeals held that the Board suffered no damage from the breach. We granted the Board’s petition for review.</p>
<p id="03a0d749-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are two issues presented on this review: (1) whether Lukaszewski breached her employment contract with the Board; and (2) if she did breach her contract, whether the Board suffered recoverable damages therefrom.</p>
<p id="03a0d74a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>I</b></p>
<p id="03a0fe5b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is undisputed that Lukaszewski resigned before her contract with the Board expired. The only question is whether her resignation was somehow justified. Lukaszewski argues that, because she resigned for health reasons, the trial court erred in finding a breach of contract. According to Lukaszewski, the uncontroverted evidence at trial established that her employment with the Board endangered her health. Therefore, her failure to fulfill her obligation under the employment contract was excused. . . . </p>
<p id="03a0fe5c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . In order to excuse Lukaszewski’s nonperformance, the trial court would had to have made a factual finding that she resigned for health reasons. The oral decision and supplemental written decision of the trial court indicate that it found otherwise. . . . </p>
<p id="03a0fe5d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . We conclude that the trial court’s findings of fact are not against the great weight and clear preponderance of the evidence and, therefore, must be upheld. Accordingly, we affirm that portion of the court of appeals’ decision which affirmed the circuit court’s determination that Lukaszewski breached her employment contract.</p>
<span title="892" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-892">p. 892</span>
<p id="03a0fe5e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>II</b></p>
<p id="03a0fe5f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This court has long held that an employer may recover damages from an employee who has failed to perform an employment contract. Walsh v. Fisher, 102 Wis. 172, 179, 78 N.W. 437 (1899). Damages in breach of contract cases are ordinarily measured by the expectations of the parties. The nonbreaching party is entitled to full compensation for the loss of his or her bargain — that is, losses necessarily flowing from the breach which are proven to a reasonable certainty and were within contemplation of the parties when the contract was made. Lommen v. Danaher, 165 Wis. 15, 19, 161 N.W. 14 (1917); Pleasure Time, Inc. v. Kuss, 78 Wis. 2d 373, 385, 254 N.W.2d 463 (1977). Thus damages for breach of an employment contract include the cost of obtaining other services equivalent to that promised but not performed, plus any foreseeable consequential damages. Roth v. Speck, 126 A.2d 153, 155 (D.C. 1956); Annot., 61 A.L.R.2d 1008 (1958).</p>
<p id="03a0fe60-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the instant case it is undisputed that, as a result of the breach, the Board hired a replacement at a salary exceeding what it had agreed to pay Lukaszewski. There is no question that this additional cost ($1,026.64) necessarily flowed from the breach and was within the contemplation of the parties when the contract was made. Lukaszewski argues and the court of appeals held, however, that the Board was not damaged by this expense. The amount a teacher is paid is determined by a salary schedule agreed upon by the teachers’ union and the Board. The more education and experience a teacher has the greater her salary will be. Presumably, then, the amount of compensation a teacher receives reflects her value to the Board. Lukaszewski argues that the Board suffered no net loss because, while it had to pay more for the replacement, it received the services of a proportionately more valuable teacher. Accordingly, she maintains that the Board is not entitled to damages because an award would place it in a better position than if the contract had been performed.</p>
<p id="03a0fe61-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We disagree. Lukaszewski and the court of appeals improperly focus on the objective value of the services the Board received rather than that for which it had bargained. Damages for breach of contract are measured by the expectations of the parties. The Board expected to receive the services of a speech therapist with Lukaszewski’s education and experience at the salary agreed upon. It neither expected nor wanted a more experienced therapist who had to be paid an additional $1,026.64 per year. Lukaszewski’s breach forced the Board to hire the replacement and, in turn, to pay a higher salary. Therefore, the Board lost the benefit of its bargain. Any additional value the Board may have received from the replacement’s greater experience was imposed upon it and thus cannot be characterized as a benefit. We conclude that the Board suffered damages for the loss of its bargain in the amount of additional compensation it was required to pay Lukaszewski’s replacement.</p>
<p id="03a0fe62-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is not to say that an employer who is injured by an employee’s breach of contract is free to hire the most qualified and expensive replacement and then recover the difference between the salary paid and the contract salary. An injured party must take all reasonable steps to mitigate damages. Kuhlman, <span title="893" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-893">p. 893</span>Inc. v. G. Heileman Brewing Co., 83 Wis. 2d 749, 752, 266 N.W.2d 382 (1978). Therefore, the employer must attempt to obtain equivalent services at the lowest possible cost. In the instant case the Board acted reasonably in hiring Lukaszewski’s replacement even though she commanded a higher salary. Upon Lukaszewski’s breach, the Board immediately took steps to locate a replacement. Only one qualified person applied for the position. Having no alternative, the Board hired this applicant. Thus the Board properly mitigated its damages by hiring the least expensive, qualified replacement available.</p>
<p id="03a0fe63-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We hold that the Board is entitled to have the benefit of its bargain restored. Therefore, we reverse that portion of the court of appeals’ decision which reversed the trial court’s damage award.</p>
<p id="03a0fe64-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The decision of the court of appeals is affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>

<p id="03a0fe67-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I dissent. The majority opinion correctly states, “The only question is whether her resignation is somehow justified.” I would hold that it was.</p>
<p id="03a0fe68-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Elaine Lukaszewski left her employment with the school board. She suffered from high blood pressure and had been treated for several years by her physician for the condition. She claimed her hypertension increased due to stress caused when the Board refused to cancel her teaching contract. Stress can cause a precipitous rise in blood pressure. High blood pressure can bring on damage to other organs of the body. . . . </p>
<p id="03a0fe69-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It seems clear from the trial judge’s comments that if he had found her physical condition had been caused by the Board’s “harassment,” he would have let her out of the contract. This is the only logical conclusion from the statement by the trial judge that, “The Court finds that the defendant’s medical excuse was a result of the stress condition she had created by an attempted repudiation of her contract, and was not the product of any unsubstantiated, so-called, harrassment [sic] by the plaintiff’s board.”</p>
<p id="03a0fe6a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In either instance, whether “caused” by the Board or “self induced” because of her gnawing feeling of being unfairly treated, the objective symptoms would be the same.</p>
<p id="03a0fe6b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Either, in my opinion, should justify termination of the contract where the physical symptoms are medically certifiable as they admittedly are here. . . . </p>
<p id="03a1257c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What the trial court said was that the desire to take the better job brought on the physical symptoms when release from her contract by the Board was refused.</p>

<li class=""><p id="03a12582-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Measurement of damages in</i> <b><i>Lukaszewski</i></b>. As we shall see, the courts will almost never order “specific performance” by an employee of the services promised in a contract of employment. The measure of damages applied in <i>Lukaszewski</i> is therefore probably the only potentially useful remedy in most cases where an employee “walks off” the job without legal justification. Is it appropriate? Would some other measure of damages (or no damages at all) be a better solution?</p>
<p id="03a12583-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You will recall that many employment contracts are “at will.” As we have seen, there are a number of potential limitations on the employer’s right to terminate such at will relationships; however, there appears to be no movement toward similar restrictions on termination by the employee. The rule applied in <i>Lukaszewski</i> will thus have application only in cases where the employee has by contract bound herself to the employer for some stated period of time. In what fields of employment are such fixed-term contracts likely to be common?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03a12584-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Illness as a defense to breach of an employment contract.</i> In Chapter 8 we examined the doctrine of impracticability and related concepts. In a personal service contract, the death or incapacity of a person necessary for performance may excuse nonperformance. See Baptist Mem. Hospital-North Mississippi, Inc. v. Lambert, 157 So. 3d 109, 114 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015); Restatement (Second) §262. Moreover, performance may be impracticable because it will involve undue risk of injury to a person. Restatement (Second) §261, Comment <i>d</i>. Do you agree with the dissent that even if Ms. Lukaszewski’s high blood pressure was “self induced” by “her gnawing feeling of being unfairly treated,” she should have been excused from performance? If so, should that feeling have to meet an objective “reasonableness” test? Or should it be enough that she did indeed suffer from such a condition because of her honest belief that she had been dealt with unjustly?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03a12585-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Prejudgment and postjudgment interest</i>. Note that a considerable amount of time passed between the breach of the contract in 1978 and the final resolution of the <i>Lukaszewski</i> case in 1983. In such situations, the prevailing party will often request interest on the amount recovered for the period of time they did not have use of the funds at issue. The successful party will usually accrue <i>postjudgment interest</i> under local law (whether for breach of contract or on other grounds) at least from the date judgment is entered, perhaps from the date of the verdict. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. §1961; N.Y. Civ. Prac. Law §§5003, 5004.</p>
<p id="03a12586-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Should the plaintiff also be entitled to <i>prejudgment interest</i> with respect to the period between the accruing of the cause of action and the date of judgment? Sometimes an agreement will provide for the payment of interest in the event of breach (for example, in a promissory note). Otherwise, a prevailing party usually will be able to recover prejudgment interest only in cases where at the time of the breach the plaintiff’s claim was for a “liquidated” sum. In Blair Constr., Inc. v. McBeth, 44 P.3d 1244 (Kan. 2002), the court stated: “A claim becomes liquidated when both the amount due and the date on which such <span title="895" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-895">p. 895</span>amount is due are fixed and certain or when the same become definitely ascertainable by mathematical calculation.” Id. at 1251. The court also ruled that the award of prejudgment interest was discretionary and that the existence of a good faith controversy about the amount of damages would not necessarily preclude prejudgment interest. Do you think the claim in <i>Lukaszewski</i> would have been viewed as liquidated or unliquidated?</p></li>

<p id="03a14c9d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs have recovered a judgment on a jury verdict of $90,000 against defendant for his failure to complete grading and to take down certain foundations and other subsurface structures to one foot below the grade line as promised. Whether the court should have charged the jury, as defendant Schectman requested, that the difference in value of plaintiffs’ property with and without the promised performance was the measure of the damage is the main point in his appeal. We hold that the request was properly denied and that the cost of completion — not the difference in value — was the proper measure. Finding no other basis for reversal, we affirm.</p>
<p id="03a14c9e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Until 1972, plaintiffs operated a pig iron manufacturing plant on land abutting the Niagara River in Tonawanda. On the 26-acre parcel were, in addition to various industrial and office buildings, a 60-ton blast furnace, large lifts, hoists and other equipment for transporting and storing ore, railroad tracks, cranes, diesel locomotives and sundry implements and devices used in the business. Since the 1870’s plaintiffs’ property, under several different owners, had been the site of various industrial operations. Having decided to close the plant, plaintiffs on August 3, 1973 made a contract in which they agreed to convey the buildings and other structures and most of the equipment to defendant, a demolition and excavating contractor, in return for defendant’s payment of $275,000 and his promise to remove the equipment, demolish the structures and grade the property as specified.</p>
<p id="03a14c9f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree with Trial Term’s interpretation of the contract as requiring defendant to remove all foundations, piers, headwalls, and other structures, including those under the surface and not visible and whether or not shown on the map attached to the contract, to a depth of approximately one foot below the specified grade lines.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10426_2c3aca9a-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10426_2c3aca9a-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">2</a></span> The proof from plaintiffs’ witnesses and the exhibits, <span title="896" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-896">p. 896</span>showing a substantial deviation from the required grade lines and the existence above grade of walls, foundations and other structures, support the finding, implicit in the jury’s verdict, that defendant failed to perform as agreed. Indeed, the testimony of defendant’s witnesses and the position he has taken during his performance of the contract and throughout this litigation (which the trial court properly rejected), viz., that the contract did not require him to remove all subsurface foundations, allow no other conclusion.</p>
<p id="03a14ca4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We turn to defendant’s argument that the court erred in rejecting his proof that plaintiffs suffered no loss by reason of the breach because it makes no difference in the value of the property whether the old foundations are at grade or one foot below grade and in denying his offer to show that plaintiffs succeeded in selling the property for $183,000 — only $3,000 less than its full fair market value. By refusing this testimony and charging the jury that the cost of completion (estimated at $110,500 by plaintiffs’ expert), not diminution in value of the property, was the measure of damage the court, defendant contends, has unjustly permitted plaintiffs to reap a windfall at his expense. Citing the definitive opinion of Chief Judge Cardozo in Jacob &amp; Youngs, Inc. v. Kent, 230 N.Y. 239, 129 N.E. 889, he maintains that the facts present a case “of substantial performance” of the contract with omissions of “trivial or inappreciable importance” (p. 245, 129 N.E. 889), and that because the cost of completion was “grossly and unfairly out of proportion to the good to be attained,” (p. 244, 129 N.E. 889), the proper measure of damage is diminution in value.</p>
<p id="03a14ca5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The general rule of damages for breach of a construction contract is that the injured party may recover those damages which are the direct, natural and immediate consequence of the breach and which can reasonably be said to have been in the contemplation of the parties when the contract was made (see 13 N.Y. Jur., Damages, §§46, 56; Chamberlain v. Parker, 45 N.Y. 569; Hadley v. Baxendale, 9 Exch. 341, 156 Eng. Reprint 145; Restatement, Contracts, §346). In the usual case where the contractor’s performance has been defective or incomplete, the reasonable cost of replacement or completion is the measure (see, Bellizzi v. Huntley Estates, 3 N.Y.2d 112, 164 N.Y.S.2d 395, 143 N.E.2d 802; . . . Restatement, Contracts, §346). When, however, there has been a substantial performance of the contract made in good faith but defects exist, the correction of which would result in economic waste, courts have measured the damages as the difference between the value of the property as constructed and the value if performance had been properly completed. . . . <i>Jacob &amp; Youngs</i> is illustrative. There, plaintiff, a contractor, had constructed a house for the defendant which was satisfactory in all respects save one: the wrought iron pipe installed for the plumbing was not of Reading manufacture, as specified in the contract, but of other brands of the same quality. Noting that the breach was unintentional and the consequences of the omission trivial, and that the cost of replacing the pipe would be “grievously out of proportion” (Jacob &amp; Youngs, Inc. v. Kent, supra, 230 N.Y. p. 244, 129 N.E. 889) to the significance of the default, the court held the breach to be immaterial and the proper measure of <span title="897" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-897">p. 897</span>damage to the owner to be not the cost of replacing the pipe but the nominal difference in value of the house with and without the Reading pipe.</p>
<p id="03a14ca6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not in all cases of claimed “economic waste” where the cost of completing performance of the contract would be large and out of proportion to the resultant benefit to the property have the courts adopted diminution in value as the measure of damage. Under the Restatement rule, the completion of the contract must involve “unreasonable economic waste” and the illustrative example given is that of a house built with pipe different in name from but equal in quality to the brand stipulated in the contract as in Jacob &amp; Youngs, Inc. v. Kent (supra) (Restatement, Contracts, §346, subd. [1], par. [a], cl. [ii], p. 573; Illustration 2, p. 576). In Groves v. John Wunder Co., 205 Minn. 163, 286 N.W. 235, plaintiff had leased property and conveyed a gravel plant to defendant in exchange for a sum of money and for defendant’s commitment to return the property to plaintiff at the end of the term at a specified grade — a promise defendant failed to perform. Although the cost of the fill to complete the grading was $60,000 and the total value of the property, graded as specified in the contract, only $12,160 the court rejected the “diminution in value” rule, stating:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03a14ca7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The owner’s right to improve his property is not trammeled by its small value. It is his right to erect thereon structures which will reduce its value. If that be the result, it can be of no aid to any contractor who declines performance. As said long ago in Chamberlain v. Parker, 45 N.Y. 569, 572: “A man may do what he will with his own, . . . and if he chooses to erect a monument to his caprice or folly on his premises, and employs and pays another to do it, it does not lie with a defendant who has been so employed and paid for building it, to say that his own performance would not be beneficial to the plaintiff.”</p>

<p id="03a14ca8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(Groves v. John Wunder Co., supra, 205 Minn., p. 168, 286 N.W. 235).</p>
<p id="03a14ca9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The “economic waste” of the type which calls for application of the “diminution in value” rule generally entails defects in construction which are irremediable or which may not be repaired without a substantial tearing down of the structure as in <i>Jacob &amp; Youngs. . . .</i></p>
<p id="03a173ba-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where, however, the breach is of a covenant which is only incidental to the main purpose of the contract and completion would be disproportionately costly, courts have applied the diminution in value measure even where no destruction of the work is entailed (see, e.g., Peevyhouse v. Garland Coal &amp; Min. Co., 382 P.2d 109 [Okla.], <i>cert. denied,</i> 375 U.S. 906, 84 S. Ct. 196, 11 L. Ed. 2d 145, holding [contrary to Groves v. John Wunder Co., supra] that diminution in value is the proper measure where defendant, the lessee of plaintiff’s lands under a coal mining lease, failed to perform costly remedial and restorative work on the land at the termination of the lease. The court distinguished the “building and construction” cases and noted that the breach was of a covenant incidental to the main purpose of the contract which was the recovery of coal from the premises to the benefit of both parties; and see Avery v. Fredericksen &amp; Westbrook, 67 Cal. App. 2d 334, 154 P.2d 41).</p>
<p id="03a173bb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="898" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-898">p. 898</span>It is also a general rule in building and construction cases, at least under <i>Jacob &amp; Youngs</i> in New York . . . , that a contractor who would ask the court to apply the diminution of value measure “as an instrument of justice” must not have breached the contract intentionally and must show substantial performance made in good faith (Jacob &amp; Youngs, Inc. v. Kent, supra, 230 N.Y. pp. 244, 245, 129 N.E. 889).</p>
<p id="03a173bc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the case before us, plaintiffs chose to accept as part of the consideration for the promised conveyance of their valuable plant and machines to defendant his agreement to grade the property as specified and to remove the foundations, piers and other structures to a depth of one foot below grade to prepare the property for sale. It cannot be said that the grading and the removal of the structures were incidental to plaintiffs’ purpose of “achieving a reasonably attractive vacant plot for resale” (compare Peevyhouse v. Garland Coal &amp; Min. Co., supra). Nor can defendant maintain that the damages which would naturally flow from his failure to do the grading and removal work and which could reasonably be said to have been in the contemplation of the parties when the contract was made would not be the reasonable cost of completion (see 13 N.Y. Jur., Damages, §§46, 56; Hadley v. Baxendale, supra). That the fulfillment of defendant’s promise would (contrary to plaintiffs’ apparent expectations) add little or nothing to the sale value of the property does not excuse the default. As in the hypothetical case posed in Chamberlain v. Parker, 45 N.Y. 569, supra (cited in Groves v. John Wunder Co., supra), of the man who “chooses to erect a monument to his caprice or folly on his premises, and employs and pays another to do it,” it does not lie with defendant here who has received consideration for his promise to do the work “to say that his own performance would not be beneficial to the plaintiff[s]” (Chamberlain v. Parker, supra, p. 572).</p>
<p id="03a173bd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant’s completed performance would not have involved undoing what in good faith was done improperly but only doing what was promised and left undone (compare Jacob &amp; Youngs, Inc. v. Kent, supra; Restatement, Contracts, §346, Illustration 2, p. 576). That the burdens of performance were heavier than anticipated and the cost of completion disproportionate to the end to be obtained does not, without more, alter the rule that the measure of plaintiffs’ damage is the cost of completion. Disparity in relative economic benefits is not the equivalent of “economic waste” which will invoke the rule in Jacob &amp; Youngs, Inc. v. Kent (supra) (see Groves v. John Wunder Co., supra). Moreover, faced with the jury’s finding that the reasonable cost of removing the large concrete and stone walls and other structures extending above grade was $90,000, defendant can hardly assert that he has rendered substantial performance of the contract or that what he left unfinished was “of trivial or inappreciable importance” (Jacob &amp; Youngs, Inc. v. Kent, supra, 230 N.Y. p. 245, 129 N.E. 889). Finally, defendant, instead of attempting in good faith to complete the removal of the underground structures, contended that he was not obliged by the contract to do so and, thus, cannot claim to be a “transgressor whose default is unintentional and trivial [and who] may hope for mercy if he will offer atonement for his wrong” (Jacob &amp; Youngs, Inc. v. Kent, supra, p. 244, <span title="899" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-899">p. 899</span>129 N.E. 889). We conclude, then, that the proof pertaining to the value of plaintiffs’ property was properly rejected and the jury correctly charged on damages.</p>

<li class=""><p id="03a173c3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Rationale for cost-to-complete measure of damages.</i> As we have seen, the basic principle for determining damages for breach of contract allows the injured party to recover an amount sufficient to give that party the benefit of the bargain. As a general matter, the cost-to-complete measure of damages seems more consistent with this principle than the diminution-in-value measure because the injured party can expend the damages to receive the bargained-for performance. Another reason for choosing the cost-to-complete measure is that the actual injury to the plaintiff may not be adequately reflected by the market-value comparison. Thus, where the plaintiff contemplates a personal use for the property (e.g., personal residence, family farm), it may be that the property has “idiosyncratic” value to the plaintiff that is not reflected in the market value of the property, in which case damages based on diminished value will clearly undercompensate the plaintiff, perhaps by a substantial but unquantifiable amount. On the other hand, where the plaintiff is a business enterprise, idiosyncratic value is much less likely, and the diminished market value of the property may appear more likely to be an accurate measure of the plaintiff’s true injury. If this factor should be viewed as controlling, was <i>American Standard</i> correctly decided? Professor Timothy Muris argued that in choosing between remedies in such cases the courts should take into account the presence of “nonpecuniary” (or “subjective”) value to the plaintiff; his survey of the decided cases suggests that indeed courts frequently do so, without necessarily adverting to that factor in their opinions. Timothy J. Muris, Cost of Completion or Diminution in Market Value: The Relevance of Subjective Value, 12 J. Legal Stud. 379 (1983). Are there any other factors that would favor cost-to-complete over diminution in market value?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03a173c4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Justification for diminution in market value damages.</i> Using the <i>Groves</i> case (also discussed in <i>American Standard</i>) as his example, Judge Posner has suggested that in such cases damages should be based on the diminished value of the land, on grounds of efficiency. Richard A. Posner, Economic Analysis of Law 132 (9th ed. 2014). Posner argues that the award of cost-to-restore damages overcompensates the owner; if the owner had truly wanted restoration of the property, he could have brought an action for specific performance. Posner notes that in <i>Groves</i> the plaintiff, who received a cost-to-restore award, did not in fact use the money to restore the land to its original condition. This argument is a corollary of the general notion of encouraging the “efficient breach,” a topic to which we return later in this chapter.</p>
<p id="03a19ad5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="900" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-900">p. 900</span>If the injured party does not use the award to restore the property, does it follow that the injured party has been overcompensated, as Posner suggests? In Emery v. Caledonia Sand &amp; Gravel Co., 374 A.2d 929 (N.H. 1977), the defendant road construction company had breached a contract to restore the excavated area on defendant’s farm. The trial court awarded the plaintiffs damages in the amount necessary to complete the restoration as promised. The Supreme Court of New Hampshire affirmed. While recognizing that there were some cases in which an award of cost-to-complete damages could result in overcompensation or economic waste, the court rejected the argument that the mere fact that the plaintiffs might pocket the money was sufficient to show unjust enrichment: “A valuable income-producing asset has been rendered unproductive; the damages awarded constitute a reasonable means of bringing that asset back to life. If the plaintiffs choose to ‘pocket’ their recovery, they will have foregone the restoration of their land; they will not have been unjustly enriched.” Id. at 933.</p>
<p id="03a19ad6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>American Standard</i> the court indicates that in some cases “economic waste” would justify an award of diminution in market value rather than cost to complete. When would the economic waste doctrine apply? See also Alan Schwartz &amp; Robert E. Scott, Market Damages, Efficient Contracting, and the Economic Waste Fallacy, 108 Colum. L. Rev. 1610 (2008) (arguing that claims of economic waste and windfall recovery against awarding cost of completion damages are unsound).</p>
<p id="03a19ad7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By the time of the decision in <i>American Standard</i>, the plaintiffs had sold the land at only $3,000 less than its market value. Did the court give too little weight to this fact? Why? Should the cost-to-restore remedy be limited to cases in which it appears that the plaintiff can and will use the damages recovered for this purpose?

More recently, the Restatement (Third) of Restitution §39, Illustration 5, takes the position that the cost of repair is the appropriate remedy in a hypothetical case drawn from the <i>Peevyhouse</i> and <i>American Standard</i> type of scenario, based on the reasoning that such costs had factored into the price set by the parties.</p></li>

<p id="03a19ae1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In its formula for calculating expectation damages, Restatement (Second) §347 distinguishes between two positive components of plaintiff’s recovery: “loss in value” (computed with respect to the value of the performance actually received from the defendant) and “other loss.” For example, when the paying party is in breach, the “loss in value” is the unpaid contract amount. When the performing party is in breach, the loss in value to the injured party is the difference between the value of what the injured party expected to receive and what he actually received.</p>
<p id="03a1c1f2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are many types of “loss” that are in a sense extrinsic to the valuation of the defendant’s performance, but that nevertheless are significant. Losses of this sort are commonly referred to as “consequential,” and recovery for such losses is subject to certain controls not applied to ordinary damages. A typical type of consequential damage is loss in profits that the nonbreaching party expected to receive from the transaction. For example, if a seller breaches a contract to sell commercial property, consequential damages could include the loss in rental income that the buyer expected to receive. These restrictions are traditionally said to originate with the following English decision, one of the few cases that probably all students of contract law have learned to remember by name, even if (as may be likely) they eventually forget what it stands for.</p>

The steam-engine was manufactured by Messrs. Joyce &amp; Co., the engineers, at Greenwich, and it became necessary to send the shaft as a pattern for a new one to Greenwich. The fracture was discovered on the 12th, and on the 13th the plaintiffs sent one of their servants to the office of the defendants, who are the well known carriers trading under the name of Pickford &amp; Co., for the purpose of having the shaft carried to Greenwich. The plaintiffs’ servant told the clerk that the mill was stopped, and that the shaft must be sent immediately; and in answer to the inquiry when the shaft would be taken, the answer was, that if it was sent up by twelve o’clock any day, it would be delivered at Greenwich on the following day. On the following day the shaft was taken by the defendants, before noon, for the purpose of being conveyed to Greenwich, and the sum of 2<i>l</i>. 4s. [2 pounds, 4 shillings — Eds.] was paid for its carriage for the whole distance; at the same time the defendants’ clerk was told that a special entry, if required, should be made to hasten its delivery. The delivery of the shaft at Greenwich was delayed by some neglect; and the consequence was, that the plaintiffs did not receive the new shaft for several days after they would otherwise have done, and the working of their mill was thereby delayed, and they thereby lost the profits they would otherwise have received.</p>
<p id="03a1c1fc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the part of the defendants, it was objected that these damages were too remote, and that the defendants were not liable with respect to them.

We think that there ought to be a new trial in this case; but, in so doing, we deem it to be expedient and necessary to state explicitly the rule which the Judge, at the next trial, ought, in our opinion, to direct the jury to be governed by when they estimate the damages.</p>
<p id="03a1c1ff-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is, indeed, of the last importance that we should do this; for, if the jury are left without any definite rule to guide them, it will, in such cases as these, manifestly lead to the greatest injustice. The Courts have done this on several occasions; and, in Blake v. Midland Railway Company (18 Q.B. 93), the Court granted a new trial on this very ground, that the rule had not been definitely laid down to the jury by the learned Judge at Nisi Prius.</p>

<p id="03a1c201-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="904" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-904">p. 904</span>Now we think the proper rule in such a case as the present is this: — Where two parties have made a contract which one of them has broken, the damages which the other party ought to receive in respect of such breach of contract should be such as may fairly and reasonably be considered either arising naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of things, from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach of it. Now, if the special circumstances under which the contract was actually made were communicated by the plaintiffs to the defendants, and thus known to both parties, the damages resulting from the breach of such a contract, which they would reasonably contemplate, would be the amount of injury which would ordinarily follow from a breach of contract under these special circumstances so known and communicated. But, on the other hand, if these special circumstances were wholly unknown to the party breaking the contract, he, at the most, could only be supposed to have had in his contemplation the amount of injury which would arise generally, and in the great multitude of cases not affected by any special circumstances, from such a breach of contract. For, had the special circumstances been known, the parties might have specially provided for the breach of contract by special terms as to the damages in that case; and of this advantage it would be very unjust to deprive them. Now the above principles are those by which we think the jury ought to be guided in estimating the damages arising out of any breach of contract. It is said, that other cases such as breaches of contract in the non-payment of money, or in the not making a good title to land, are to be treated as exceptions from this, and as governed by a conventional rule. But as, in such cases, both parties must be supposed to be cognisant of that well-known rule, these cases may, we think, be more properly classed under the rule above enunciated as to cases under known special circumstances, because there both parties may reasonably be presumed to contemplate the estimation of the amount of damages according to the conventional rule. Now, in the present case, if we are to apply the principles above laid down, we find that the only circumstances here communicated by the plaintiffs to the defendants at the time the contract was made, were, that the article to be carried was the broken shaft of a mill, and that the plaintiffs were the millers of that mill. But how do these circumstances shew reasonably that the profits of the mill must be stopped by an unreasonable delay in the delivery of the broken shaft by the carrier to the third person? Suppose the plaintiffs had another shaft in their possession put up or putting up at the time, and that they only wished to send back the broken shaft to the engineer who made it; it is clear that this would be quite consistent with the above circumstances, and yet the unreasonable delay in the delivery would have no effect upon the intermediate profits of the mill. Or, again, suppose that, at the time of the delivery to the carrier, the machinery of the mill had been in other respects defective, then, also, the same results would follow. Here it is <span title="905" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-905">p. 905</span>true that the shaft was actually sent back to serve as a model for a new one, and that the want of a new one was the only cause of the stoppage of the mill, and that the loss of profits really arose from not sending down the new shaft in proper time, and that this arose from the delay in delivering the broken one to serve as a model. But it is obvious that, in the great multitude of cases of millers sending off broken shafts to third persons by a carrier under ordinary circumstances, such consequences would not, in all probability, have occurred; and these special circumstances were here never communicated by the plaintiffs to the defendants. It follows, therefore, that the loss of profits here cannot reasonably be considered such a consequence of the breach of contract as could have been fairly and reasonably contemplated by both the parties when they made this contract. For such loss would neither have flowed naturally from the breach of this contract in the great multitude of such cases occurring under ordinary circumstances, nor were the special circumstances, which, perhaps, would have made it a reasonable and natural consequence of such breach of contract, communicated to or known by the defendants. The Judge ought, therefore, to have told the jury, that, upon the facts then before them, they ought not to take the loss of profits into consideration at all in estimating the damages. There must therefore be a new trial in this case.</p>

<li class=""><p id="03a1e915-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>What did the clerk know?</i> The Hadley v. Baxendale opinion has had universal acceptance in Anglo-American law as stating an appropriate rule of limitation on damages that would otherwise be recoverable under an unrestricted “expectation” rule. Does the decision itself appear to be sustainable on the facts of the <i>Hadley</i> case? In Victoria Laundry (Windsor) Ltd. v. Newman Industries, Ltd., [1949] 2 K.B. 528, 537 (C.A.), a later English court expressed the opinion that the headnote to <i>Hadley</i> is “definitely misleading in so far as it says that the defendants’ clerk, who attended at the office, was told that the mill was stopped and that the shaft must be delivered immediately.” If the court in <i>Hadley</i> had actually regarded that as established, it was asserted, then it is “reasonably plain” from Baron Alderson’s opinion in <i>Hadley</i> that it would have decided that case “the other way round.” On the other hand, it has been suggested that the opinion in <i>Hadley</i> can be viewed as consistent with the facts as stated in the headnote if one assumes that the clerk was not told either that the stoppage of the mill was solely due to the shaft’s being broken or that no other shaft was available in the meantime. Charles T. McCormick, The Contemplation Rule as a Limitation upon Damages for Breach of Contract, 19 Minn. L. Rev. 497, 500-501 (1935). Richard Danzig concludes that there is evidence both ways on the question of whether the Hadleys indeed “served notice on the . . . clerk of their extreme dependence on the shaft,” but suggests that in any event the <span title="906" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-906">p. 906</span>“rudimentary law of agency” as it then existed might have required notice to be served on Baxendale himself, or at least on some agent more exalted than a mere receiving clerk. Richard Danzig, Hadley v. Baxendale, A Study in the Industrialization of the Law, 4 J. Legal Stud. 249, 262-263 (1975). Danzig’s article (substantially incorporated also in his book with Geoffrey R. Watson, The Capability Problem in Contract Law (2d ed. 2004)) explores the context in which the <i>Hadley</i> case was decided. Besides the now conventional notion that the <i>Hadley</i> decision was more or less consciously an attempt to protect infant industries in the early stages of the industrial revolution, Danzig sees a number of other factors reflected in that decision: tensions between Parliament and the courts, between different courts, and between judge and jury; differences over the proper extent of liability of common carriers, and about the way in which their activities should be regulated; and the still rudimentary state in 1854 of both commercial and agency law.

<li class=""><p id="03a1e916-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>General and consequential damages.</i> In <i>Hadley</i> the court refers to two types of damages: those that arise naturally from the breach of contract and those that result from special circumstances communicated at the time the contract was formed. These two types of damages have various labels. Damages that arise naturally are often referred to as “general” or “direct” damages. Damages flowing from special circumstances are usually called “consequential” damages although the term “special” damages is sometimes used. (You should also be aware that in tort law a different terminology is employed. Special damages in tort refer to out-of-pocket medical expenses, while general damages refer to pain and suffering.)</p>
<p id="03a1e917-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff need not make any special showing to recover general damages. For example, in a contract for the sale of land, the difference between the contract price and the market value constitutes general damages. Using the terminology of the Restatement formula discussed at the beginning of this chapter, general damages are called “loss in value.”</p>
<p id="03a1e918-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The most important type of consequential damages in commercial cases is lost profits arising from collateral contracts. (Note that lost profit on the contract that is breached, as opposed to other contracts, is treated as general rather than consequential damages). Consequential damages also include injury to person or property caused by goods that fail to comply with contractual warranties. On the distinction between general and consequential damages, see American List Corp. v. U.S. News &amp; World Report, Inc., 549 N.E.2d 1161 (N.Y. 1989) (lost profits on contract that was breached rather than on collateral contract are general damages not subject to rule of Hadley v. Baxendale).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03a1e919-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Foreseeability.</i> The modern formulation of the rule of Hadley v. Baxendale is now stated in terms of the foreseeability of the loss. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts §351 and UCC §2-715(2). Several aspects of the foreseeability standard should be noted. As the court in <i>Hadley</i> states, the recoverability of consequential damages depends on whether such damages <span title="907" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-907">p. 907</span>were in the contemplation of the parties “at the time they made the contract.” It might plausibly be contended that liability for the foreseeable consequences of breach of contract ought to be based on the breacher’s knowledge as of the time the <i>breach</i> occurs, just as the law of torts generally makes the tortfeasor’s knowledge at the time of the tortious conduct the test for liability based on foreseeability of harm. However, application of the <i>Hadley</i> test is uniformly understood to depend on the defendant’s knowledge at the time the contract is made. Why should this be so?</p>
<p id="03a1e91a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, it is only necessary that the type of loss be foreseeable, not the manner in which the loss occurs. E.g., Kraatz v. USAA Cas. Ins. Co., 2017 WL 876187 (W.D. N.Y.) (breaching insurer liable to insured for costs incurred in obtaining a second mortgage on home to finance necessary repairs and replacements; such expenses should have been reasonably foreseen by insurer); Williams v. Gray Group, L.L.C., 79 N.E.3d 1146 (Ohio Ct. App. 2016) (breaching contractor should have foreseen that defective home renovation would occasion plaintiffs’ withdrawal of money from retirement account, incurring substantial IRS penalties). Third, while courts sometimes refer to risks that are within the contemplation of both parties, the focus of foreseeability is on the breaching party. Fourth, the standard for foreseeability is at least in part objective. The breaching party is liable for losses about which it had reason to know. Finally, the loss must be foreseeable as a “probable” result of the breach. Core-Mark Midcontinent Inc. v. Sonitrol Corp., 370 P.3d 353, 360 (Colo. Ct. App. 2016) (loss must be foreseeable as “probable” result of breach; standard for recovery is more restrictive than tort rule of “reasonable foreseeability”). Liability is not limited to losses that are necessary or inevitable, but it does not extend to remote losses. See E. Allan Farnsworth, Contracts §12.14, at 795-796 (4th ed. 2004); Restatement (Second) Contracts §351, Comment <i>a</i>.</p></li>

Baxendale. Under the tacit agreement test the injured party would have been required to show not only that the special circumstances were brought to the attention of the other party, but also that the other party “assumed consciously” the liability in question. Globe Refining Co. v. Landa Cotton Oil Co., 190 U.S. 540, 544 (1903). Modern contract law has largely rejected the tacit agreement test. See Rexnord Corp. v. DeWolff Boberg &amp; Assoc., Inc., 286 F.3d 1001 (7th Cir. 2002); Restatement (Second) of Contracts §351, Comment <i>a</i>; UCC §2-715, Comment 2; but see Sunnyland Farms, Inc. v. Central New Mexico Electrical Cooperative, Inc., 255 P.3d 324 (N.M. Ct. App. 2011) (New Mexico common law still requires that breaching party must “explicitly or tacitly” agree to be responsible for consequential damages likely to occur in event of breach).</p>
<p id="03a2102f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professor Richard Epstein has criticized the modern rejection of the “tacit agreement” test and the general application of the rule of Hadley v. Baxendale. He argues that determination of the amount of contract damages should be viewed as a question of contract interpretation. When the contract specifies the measure of damages, the contractual provision should be enforced, absent fraud, duress, or some other invalidating conduct. When the contract is silent on the measure of damages, the court should adopt the “default rule” of damages that the parties would most likely have agreed on had they considered the issue of damages. Relying on commercial practice, reflected in various types of contracts, which limits expectation damages below the amount that would be fixed by the <i>Hadley</i> rule (for example, consumer goods are typically sold with a “repair or replace” warranty), Epstein argues that the appropriate default rule will often be less than the amount determined under a <i>Hadley</i> approach. Richard A. Epstein, Beyond Foreseeability: Consequential Damages in the Law of Contract, 18 J. Legal Stud. 105 (1989).</p>
<p id="03a21030-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By contrast, Professor Melvin Eisenberg reaches conclusions that are diametrically opposed to Epstein’s. Melvin A. Eisenberg, The Principle of <i>Hadley v. Baxendale</i>, 80 Cal. L. Rev. 563 (1992). Eisenberg argues that the utility of the <i>Hadley</i> rule depends on communication of information by buyers and use by sellers of such information in setting prices to reflect risk. Id. at 587-588. This process is unlikely to occur, however, particularly with regard to standardized products, because of the costs of communicating and utilizing information. Id. at 592. Thus, Eisenberg concludes, the costs of the <i>Hadley</i> rule are likely to exceed its benefits. Id. at 597-598. He advocates a rule that would allow recovery of all losses that are proximately caused by a breach (in essence, the tort standard), subject to contractual allocation of risk and principles of fair disclosure of contractual limitations on liability. Id. at 598. For other scholarly commentary on the <i>Hadley</i> rule, see Eric A. Posner, Essay: Economic Analysis of Contract Law After Three Decades: Success or Failure? 112 Yale L.J. 829, 836-839 (2003); George S. Geis, Empirically Assessing Hadley v. Baxendale, 32 Fla. St. U. L. Rev. 897 (2005).</p></li>

<p id="03a21037-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We consider the appropriateness of a jury award of lost profits over a two year time period in favor of . . . Florafax International, Inc. against . . . GTE Market Resources, Inc., for breaching a contract requiring GTE to provide telecommunication and/or telemarketing services for Florafax. The profits were those Florafax claimed it stood to make from a collateral contract it had with a third party, but allegedly lost when the collateral contract was canceled purportedly because GTE breached its contract with Florafax. . . . </p>

<p id="03a2103a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Florafax is generally a flowers-by-wire company acting as a clearinghouse to allow the placement and receipt of orders between florists throughout the United States and internationally. . . . </p>
<p id="03a2374b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to the above activities, Florafax solicits agreements with third party clients such as supermarket chains, American Express and other entities that advertise the sale of floral products by various methods (e.g., television, radio, newspapers, billing circulars, mass mailings to consumers) which allow a consumer to order floral arrangements via the use of a 1-800 telephone call, with Florafax agreeing to handle the actual inbound and outbound communication aspects of the transactions. . . . </p>
<p id="03a2374c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One client that signed up for an arrangement like that described immediately above was Bellerose Floral, Inc., d/b/a Flora Plenty, a leading marketer of floral products advertising sales through use of the telephone number 1-800-FLOWERS. Florafax and Bellerose entered a contract in early October 1989 whereby Florafax and/or its designee would accept direct consumer orders (i.e. inbound calls and orders) placed via the 1-800-FLOWERS number and, of course, it also agreed to handle the outbound placement of orders either by telephone or computer transmission. The Florafax/Bellerose contract provided Florafax would be paid certain fee(s) per order. As we read the contract its initial term was for one year, to be automatically renewed from month to month thereafter, but that either party, with or without cause, could terminate the agreement upon sixty (60) days written notice.</p>
<p id="03a2374d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">GTE, on the other hand, was a company providing telecommunication and/or telemarketing services for other businesses. It provided for other businesses a call answering center where telemarketing sales representatives (TSRs) physically answered telephones when orders from promotional activities came in from consumers and took care of transmitting the orders by telephone or computer for fulfillment. For certain management and business-related reasons Florafax subcontracted out much of the telecommunication and telemarketing services of its business.</p>
<p id="03a2374e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="910" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-910">p. 910</span>In mid-October 1989, about two weeks after Florafax signed its agreement with Bellerose, the Florafax/GTE contract was entered. In essence, it provided GTE would via a call answering center (apparently located in the Dallas, Texas area) handle much, if not all, of the activities connected with taking incoming orders and placing outgoing calls or computer transmissions directed to it by Florafax associated with the purchase and fulfillment of floral orders throughout the United States and internationally. The agreement required Florafax to pay GTE certain fees for this service depending on the type of order.</p>
<p id="03a2374f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Florafax/GTE contract generally ran for a term of three years from the effective date the parties anticipated Florafax would begin directing calls to GTE for floral orders — a date anticipated to be in early December 1989. It also contained certain provisions that in essence might result in termination after a two year period based upon application of a price/fee renegotiation clause. In answer to one of the questions submitted via a special verdict form, the jury determined the Florafax/GTE contract could be terminated after two years based on this clause.</p>
<p id="03a23750-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The contract further contained a clause concerning lost profits providing in pertinent part:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03a23751-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">20. Termination</p>
<p id="03a23752-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>a. Termination for cause.</i> Any non-defaulting party shall have the right to terminate this agreement at any date not less than forty-five (45) days after an event of default occurs and so long as it continues. In the event GTE [] ceases to perform its duties hereunder after a notice of termination is given or otherwise, Florafax may suffer tremendous damage to its business. GTE [] agrees to pay Florafax consequential damages and lost profits on the business lost.</p>
</div>
<p id="03a23753-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The contract also specifically noted GTE would be providing services not only for Florafax, but for others.</p>
<p id="03a23754-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to the above express contractual provisions, evidence was presented that officials with GTE knew prior to signing the contract that GTE would be providing its services not only directly for Florafax, but that Florafax had been soliciting business from entities such as Bellerose, business that was anticipated to be at least partially directed through GTE’s call answering center. In fact, competent evidence exists in this record showing GTE specifically knew when it signed the contract with Florafax that Bellerose was considering turning over a portion of its inbound and outbound business to Florafax, and that Bellerose received somewhere between 100,000-200,000 orders annually. Evidence was also presented that showed GTE, prior to contract execution, considered it a positive aspect of entering the agreement that Florafax was constantly marketing and promoting its business by the addition of outside clients and that this addition of clients would lead to revenue increases. Evidence also existed that Bellerose was Florafax’s largest customer and that it had been an ongoing business for at least sixteen (16) years prior to the date of trial.</p>
<p id="03a23755-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Evidence was also submitted showing that before GTE entered the contract, its director of finance and administration did a financial analysis of the Florafax/<span title="911" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-911">p. 911</span>GTE contract and determined GTE would make little or no money from it. His immediate supervisor (the general manager of GTE) was informed of the analysis. GTE, however, made the decision to enter the contract, apparently because it needed new customers and/or in the hope this financial analysis was wrong.</p>
<p id="03a23756-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although from December 1989 through Valentine’s Day in February 1990 certain problems surfaced in regard to the adequacy of GTE’s performance, at some point after Valentine’s Day the problems appeared to worsen. At some time after Valentine’s Day and leading up to Mother’s Day in May 1990, the latter holiday being described as the largest floral holiday of the year, the adequacy of GTE’s performance became subject to serious question. What appears from the evidence to be the most glaring breach on GTE’s part was a failure during the week leading up to Mother’s Day to provide sufficient TSRs to answer calls anticipated to be directed to it by Florafax, including calls from Bellerose. Without adequate TSRs to take the calls, floral product orders would obviously be lost and Florafax income lost in the process.</p>
<p id="03a23757-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Coupled with this evidence of a failure to adequately staff for anticipated calls, there was also evidence that during the term of the contract GTE’s project manager for the Florafax account admitted to Florafax’s off-site manager stationed at the GTE facility to look out for Florafax’s interests there, that GTE no longer wanted the Florafax account — in essence, because GTE was not making money under the contract’s pricing scheme. . . . </p>
<p id="03a23758-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition, evidence was presented that GTE’s failure to perform caused Bellerose to terminate its agreement with Florafax and Bellerose ceased its relationship with Florafax apparently some time in July 1990, directing no more calls from its 1-800-FLOWERS number through GTE after that time. The President of Bellerose essentially testified that he anticipated his agreement with Florafax to be a long-term relationship if things worked out and, although his testimony was not absolute in such regard, that he pulled out of his relationship with Florafax because of the poor performance of GTE. . . . </p>
<p id="03a23759-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a result of GTE’s breach, in addition to losing Bellerose as a client, Florafax incurred costs primarily associated with taking steps necessary to set up its own call answering center in Tulsa to perform the duties GTE was supposed to handle so that it would not lose other clients or business relationships as it had lost Bellerose. Florafax finally left the GTE facility at the end of September 1990.</p>
<p id="03a2375a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to seeking damages attributable to costs associated with performing the services GTE was supposed to perform, Florafax sought lost profits it claimed would have been realized from the Florafax/Bellerose contract. In support of and in opposition to the lost profit claim the parties presented conflicting economic projections through expert witnesses (Florafax through an economist, GTE through a Certified Public Accountant) as to how much profit, if any, Florafax would have made from the Bellerose contract over varying lengths of time. . . . </p>
<p id="03a2375b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One major difference between the experts’ projections was that the Florafax expert increased the Bellerose sales volume from 1990 to 1991 one hundred percent (100%), while the GTE expert kept the call and order volumes flat in his projections. The one hundred percent (100%) increase was based on evidence the Bellerose sales <span title="912" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-912">p. 912</span>volume increased about this percentage over the 1990 year levels. GTE’s expert, in contrast, used a flat growth rate because a general floral industry survey indicated declining volumes in the floral industry from the late 1980s through 1991.</p>
<p id="03a25d6c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Florafax expert estimated the Bellerose loss at $1,921,028.00 for a period extended out to three years, i.e. for the period of time that remained in the term of the Florafax/GTE contract at the time Bellerose canceled. The GTE expert estimated the Bellerose loss over the same time frame to be $505,731.00 if the fees to be paid to GTE by Florafax remained constant for this period of time. The GTE expert also gave an alternative figure that coincided with the remaining part of a two year period beginning in December 1989 based on the view the Florafax/GTE contract would be subject to termination at such time in view of the price renegotiation provisions of that contract. The loss of profits for this period was estimated to be $294,044.00. These figures of the two experts took into consideration that the fees Florafax had to pay to GTE for its services would have to be deducted from the income or revenue Florafax would have received from Bellerose orders.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN106C5_2c3aca9a-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N106C5_2c3aca9a-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">5</a></span></p>
<p id="03a25d6e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The jury determined GTE breached its contract with Florafax and, in addition to other damages, awarded Florafax $750,000.00 in lost profits that would have been earned under the Florafax/Bellerose contract over a two year period of time. Other damages awarded to Florafax included a little over $820,000.00, the majority of which reflected costs and expenses associated with setting up and/or expanding a call center in Tulsa, Oklahoma to perform those functions GTE was supposed to perform under the Florafax/GTE contract. On appeal, GTE, although not admitting liability — i.e. that it breached its contract with Florafax — does not contest the jury determination that it did breach the contract. We now turn to the lost profit damage issues to be reviewed.</p>
<p id="03a25d6f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>III. <span class="epub-small-caps">Lost Profits from a Collateral Contract May Be Recovered as a Proper Element of Damage for Breach of Contract</span></b></p>
<p id="03a25d70-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">GTE raises two basic arguments on the propriety of the recovery of lost profits. These are: 1) lost profit damages cannot include profits from third-party collateral contracts or, if they are recoverable, Florafax failed to prove entitlement to them because it failed to show the prospect of profits from the Florafax/Bellerose contract or, conversely, the loss of such profits upon GTE’s breach, were in the contemplation of GTE and Florafax at the time they entered the Florafax/GTE contract; and, 2) if lost profits from the Florafax/Bellerose <span title="913" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-913">p. 913</span>contract are recoverable they must be limited to a sixty (60) day period, because profits beyond this time must be deemed too remote, speculative or uncertain, and Florafax could not be said to be reasonably assured of any profits from its relationship with Bellerose for any longer period, given the Florafax/Bellerose contract clause allowing either Florafax or Bellerose the right to terminate that contract upon sixty (60) days notice. In our view, each argument is without merit.</p>
<p id="03a25d71-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>III(A). Collateral Contracts and Lost Profits</b></p>
<p id="03a25d72-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">GTE asserts Oklahoma jurisprudence has not squarely addressed the question of whether a party suing for breach of contract may recover lost profits arising from a collateral contract. Although this Court may not have used the exact phrase “lost profits from third-party collateral contracts” a review of Oklahoma law makes clear if such damages are properly proved they are recoverable. Thus, GTE’s apparent view that lost profits from a collateral contract are never recoverable for breach of contract because as a matter of law they are inherently too remote, speculative and/or unforeseeable, is mistaken.</p>
<p id="03a25d73-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The time-honored general rules on recovery of damages for breach of contract are found in Hadley v. Baxendale, 9 Ex. 341, 156 Eng. Rep. 145 (1854). . . . The lost profits involved here fall under the second branch of the Hadley v. Baxendale formulation.</p>
<p id="03a25d74-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Generally speaking, this Court has long espoused the view that loss of future or anticipated profit — i.e. loss of expected monetary gain — is recoverable in a breach of contract action: 1) if the loss is within the contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was made, 2) if the loss flows directly or proximately from the breach — i.e. if the loss can be said to have been caused by the breach — and 3) if the loss is capable of reasonably accurate measurement or estimate. Groendyke Transport, Inc. v. Merchant, 380 P.2d 682 Second Syllabus (Okla. 1962). An award in the form of a loss of profits, in fact, is generally considered a common measure of damages for breach of contract, it frequently represents fulfillment of the non-breaching party’s expectation interest, and it often closely approximates the goal of placing the innocent party in the same position as if the contract had been fully performed. H. Hunter, Modern Law of Contracts, Breach &amp; Remedies, ¶7.02[2] at 7-5/7-6 (1986).</p>
<p id="03a25d75-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our cases also recognize that where there is sufficient evidence presented on the issue of the recovery of special damages — including lost profits — what was or was not in the contemplation of the parties at the time of contracting is a question of fact to be determined by the trier of fact. Home-Stake Production Company v. Minnis, 443 P.2d 91, 103 (Okla. 1968). . . . </p>
<p id="03a25d76-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, there is clearly sufficient competent evidence to show GTE had within its contemplation at the time of contracting the potential for profits from a Florafax association with Bellerose. As we noted in section II. FACTS above, GTE knew it would be providing services not only directly for Florafax, but for others on behalf of Florafax. It knew Florafax was soliciting other entities to use <span title="914" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-914">p. 914</span>the services of a call answering center like GTE’s and, in fact, GTE looked upon Florafax’s solicitation of these other entities as a positive aspect of a contractual relationship with Florafax because of the potential for increased revenue.</p>
<p id="03a25d77-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Trial evidence also showed the Florafax/Bellerose contract was entered two weeks prior to the Florafax/GTE agreement and that GTE officials knew either before or contemporaneously with signing the latter contract that Bellerose was considering turning over a portion of its inbound and outbound business via its 1-800-FLOWERS network to Florafax — business GTE also knew consisted of 100,000-200,000 orders annually. Further, as already noted, a clause in the Florafax/GTE contract itself expressly reflects the parties’ contemplation of the recovery of lost profits by Florafax should GTE cease to perform its duties and obligations during the term of the contract — and, as also noted, evidence exists in this record that GTE intentionally failed to perform during part of the term of the contract, a failure on its part we conclude would support a determination the lost profit clause of the Florafax/GTE contract was implicated. . . . </p>
<p id="03a25d78-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>III(B). The Sixty (60) Day Termination Clause in the Florafax/Bellerose Contract Does not Preclude the Recovery of Lost Profits Beyond the Sixty (60) Day Period</b></p>
<p id="03a25d79-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">GTE, in addition to arguing no lost profits are proper, alternatively asserts that if their recovery is appropriate, they must be limited to a period of sixty (60) days because of the termination notice clause of the Florafax/Bellerose contract which allowed either party to that agreement to terminate that contract, with or without cause, upon sixty (60) days written notice. For this position prime reliance is placed on Osborn v. Commanche Cattle Industries, Inc., 545 P.2d 827 (Okla. Ct. Civ. App. 1975), an opinion of the Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals. Although we believe the rule of law laid down in <i>Osborn</i> is sound, the rule is not controlling here.</p>
<p id="03a25d7a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Osborn</i> involved a situation where plaintiff had contracted with a feedlot to perform certain [services]. The contract was for a term of three years, but contained a clause allowing either party to terminate the agreement by giving the other thirty (30) days advance notice. . . . The trial court allowed the lost profit issue to go to the jury with instructions allowing their recovery for the entire three year period, over defendant’s objection only nominal damages were appropriate because either party to the contract had the right to terminate it upon thirty (30) days notice.</p>
<p id="03a25d7b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Osborn</i> court found error in submitting the lost profit issue to the jury for a longer period than the thirty (30) day notice time frame based on the following rule of law: no party to a contract may recover more in damages for a breach of the contract than might have been gained by full performance. <i>Osborn,</i> supra, 545 P.2d at 831. . . . In other words, in <i>Osborn</i> it was absolutely certain plaintiff could not establish lost profits for any greater period of time because the defendant had an absolute right to terminate the contract upon <span title="915" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-915">p. 915</span>giving the agreed notice and exercise of this right would have provided full performance on the defendant’s part.</p>
<p id="03a2848c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The situation here is quite different. . . . GTE had no right to terminate either the Florafax/GTE or Florafax/Bellerose contracts upon any short specified notice provision. That right belonged only to Florafax and Bellerose, and only in relation to the latter contract. Thus, full performance could not have been supplied by the simple expediency of GTE giving sixty (60) days notice to Florafax that it was terminating their agreement. Instead, the Florafax/GTE contract, according to the unchallenged finding of the jury, had a minimum term of two years based on the effect of the price renegotiation provisions of the contract, i.e. Florafax was guaranteed performance by GTE for a full two years.</p>
<p id="03a2848d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . In fact, competent evidence exists supporting the view it is probable some additional profits would have been made from the Bellerose relationship for a longer period of time. Further, application of the <i>Osborn</i> rule here would improperly allow GTE to benefit from a cancellation right it had no ability to exercise. Accordingly, the rule of <i>Osborn</i> does not preclude Florafax’s recovery of lost profit damages associated with the loss of the Bellerose relationship in excess of a sixty (60) day period.</p>

<p id="03a2848f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even though the rule of <i>Osborn</i> is inapplicable, GTE’s arguments as to the termination notice clause of the collateral contract do, however, implicate the legal principle that before lost profit damages are recoverable it must be adequately shown such profits were reasonably certain to have been made by the non-breaching party absent breach. We believe the answer to the reasonable certainty question is not one subject to decision as a matter of law under this record, but was one of fact to be decided by the trier of fact — here the jury.</p>
<p id="03a28490-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In order for damages to be recoverable for breach of contract they must be clearly ascertainable, in both their nature and origin, and it must be made to appear they are the natural and proximate consequence of the breach and not speculative and contingent. Chorn v. Williams, 186 Okla. 646, 99 P.2d 1036, 1037 (1940). It is not necessary, however, for the recovery of lost profits shown to have been caused by a breach of contract, that the profits be established with absolute certainty and barring any possibility of failure, but it is only required that it be established with reasonable certainty that profits would have been made had the contract not been breached. Megert v. Bauman, 206 Okla. 651, 246 P.2d 355, 358 (1952). In essence, what a plaintiff must show for the recovery of lost profits is sufficient certainty that reasonable minds might believe from a preponderance of the evidence that such damages were actually suffered. . . . </p>
<p id="03a28491-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once it is made to clearly appear that loss of business profits has been suffered by virtue of the breach, it is proper to let the jury decide what the loss is <span title="916" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-916">p. 916</span>from the best evidence the nature of the case admits. . . . When a breach of a contractual obligation with resulting damages has been established, although the amount of damages may not be based on mere speculation, conjecture and surmise alone, the mere uncertainty as to the exact amount of damages will not preclude the right of recovery. . . . It is sufficient if the evidence shows the extent of damage by just and reasonable inference. . . . We believe sufficient evidence was presented so that Florafax carried its burden to prove the fact, cause and amount of its lost profit damages with the requisite degree of reasonable certainty.</p>
<p id="03a28492-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The fact of lost profit damage beyond merely a sixty (60) day period is shown by the testimony of Bellerose’s President. Although not absolute, his testimony was, in essence, he considered the relationship with Florafax a long-term one had things worked out and that the most important issues to him in making the decision to terminate were issues concerning performance. This testimony showed the relationship in all probability would have continued long after it was terminated had GTE adequately performed. Although it is true — given the existence of the sixty (60) day notice provision — Bellerose might have terminated the Florafax/Bellerose contract at some point in time even had GTE performed, the state of this record does not require a conclusion Bellerose would have exercised its right of termination for some other reason.</p>
<p id="03a28493-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are also of the view the fact of damage is partially shown by the projections for profits of both the damage experts presented by the parties. Although they differed in their ultimate conclusions as to the extent or amount of lost profits, both presented estimates that Florafax could have made profits from the Florafax/Bellerose relationship had it survived.</p>
<p id="03a28494-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Causation is also shown by sufficient competent evidence, evidence that partially overlaps with that of the fact of damage in this case. There is enough evidence to support a reasonable determination that Bellerose’s decision to cancel or terminate its relationship with Florafax was the direct result of GTE’s failure to render adequate performance and, that GTE’s breach of the Florafax/GTE contract caused the cancellation. Therefore, there is sufficient evidence in this record upon which reasonable minds might rely that profits from the Florafax/Bellerose relationship would have actually been made by Florafax beyond a sixty (60) day period and that GTE’s breach of its contract with Florafax caused the loss of Bellerose as a client.</p>
<p id="03a28495-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As to the exact extent or amount of damages, the record contains sufficient evidence to take the matter out of the realm of mere speculation, conjecture or surmise. A track record existed which showed the calls coming to GTE from Bellerose during the five to seven months Bellerose business was actually being routed to GTE. There was also evidence that although the business relationship between Florafax and Bellerose was relatively new, Bellerose had been in business for a number of years, and it had experienced 100,000-200,000 orders annually. Such evidence clearly was appropriate to <span title="917" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-917">p. 917</span>consider on the issue of the extent of lost profits. Although this case is not exactly like our cases dealing with the destruction of an established business by a breach of contract, it is sufficiently close to be analogized to the established business situation, where we have allowed the recovery of lost profits. . . . </p>
<p id="03a28496-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Evidence also existed which showed that Bellerose, after terminating its relationship with Florafax, experienced a substantial increase in its sales volume in 1991. In other words, there was not only evidence tending to show a certain volume of orders prior to the breach, but evidence tending to show that level of sales would have in all probability increased substantially during part of the term of the Florafax/GTE contract had Bellerose continued its relationship with Florafax. This post-breach evidence is proper to be considered at arriving at a reasonable estimate of the loss caused by a breach of contract . . . because all facts which would reasonably tend to make certain the amount of injury inflicted are admissible. . . . Although the jury apparently did not totally credit the testimony or documentation presented by either Florafax’s or GTE’s experts as to their projections of profits lost, the $750,000.00 awarded for the two year period was within the range of the estimates of the two experts. Accordingly, not only was the fact and causation of lost profit damages adequately shown to a reasonable certainty, but the amount of lost profit damages awarded was sufficiently shown through competent evidence contained in this record to take the matter out of the realm of mere speculation, conjecture and surmise.</p>

<li class=""><p id="03a2abae-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Applying Hadley v. Baxendale</i>. In applying the rule of Hadley v. Baxendale, the court in <i>Florafax International</i> points out that the Florafax/Bellerose contract was signed two weeks before the Florafax/GTE agreement. Would the result in the case have been different if the Florafax/Bellerose contract had been signed after the Florafax/GTE agreement?</p>
<p id="03a2abaf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lost profits from the Bellerose contract were subject to the second prong of the <i>Hadley</i> test because they arose from a <i>collateral contract</i> rather than from <span title="918" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-918">p. 918</span>breach of the Florafax/GTE agreement itself. Since Florafax was a recipient rather than a provider of telecommunications services, it did not expect to receive a profit on its contract with GTE. In cases where the plaintiff seeks lost profits it would have made <i>on the contract sued on</i>, these damages will be subject to the first rather than the second prong of the <i>Hadley</i> test, and will be recoverable (as “general” or “direct” damages) without the need to show foreseeability. It may also be easier to prove such damages with reasonable certainty. See Lewis Jorge Construction Management, Inc. v. Pomona Unified School Dist., 102 P.3d 257 (Cal. 2004) (contractor could recover lost profits on contract breached by school district but not for alleged lost profits on future, collateral contracts that were never made due to loss in bonding capacity; other types of transactions might justify lost profits on collateral contracts).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03a2abb0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Contractual limitations on consequential damages.</i> How can a contracting party avoid potentially large liability for consequential damages flowing from the breach of a contract? In <i>Florafax International</i> the Florafax/GTE contract specifically provided that GTE would be liable for consequential damages in the event the contract was terminated for cause. Was this provision essential to Florafax International’s recovery of lost profits? Contractual assumptions of liability for consequential damages are, however, somewhat unusual. Much more common are contractual disclaimers or limitations of liability for consequential damages. Transactions governed by the UCC have specific rules governing contractual disclaimers of warranties or limitations of remedies for breach of warranty. See UCC §§2-316 (exclusion or modification of warranty), 2-719 (modification or limitation of remedy). Courses on UCC Article 2 examine these concepts in more detail. Statutes at both the federal and state level may regulate disclaimers and limitations of remedies in consumer transactions. For transactions in which the UCC and other statutory law are not applicable, general contractual principles apply. Can you think of any reason why GTE would have agreed to assume liability of a potentially unknown amount for consequential damages? As a lawyer for GTE could you have suggested a modification of this clause that would provide it protection against catastrophic damages?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03a2abb1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Requirement of certainty.</i> As the court points out, an injured party cannot recover damages that are “speculative.” Plaintiffs must prove their damages with “reasonable certainty.” See Restatement (Second) of Contracts §352. In applying this limitation, courts often draw a distinction between uncertainty about the <i>fact</i> of damage and uncertainty regarding the <i>amount</i> of damage. When the plaintiff establishes the fact of damage, the jury is given wide leeway in awarding compensation. See Pharmathene, Inc. v. Siga Techs., Inc., 2014 Del. Ch. LEXIS 142 (Del. Ch.) (while proof of the fact of damages must be certain, proof of the amount of damage does not require mathematical precision as long as the court has a reasonable basis for awarding damages). Consider Contemporary Mission, Inc. v. Famous Music Corp., 557 F.2d 918 (2d Cir. 1977), in which the plaintiff claimed that the defendant had breached a contract to produce and promote <span title="919" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-919">p. 919</span>recordings of songs composed by members of the plaintiff (a nonprofit corporation formed by a small group of Roman Catholic priests). The Court of Appeals held that the plaintiff could recover lost profits resulting from the defendant’s failure to promote plaintiff’s record, “Fear No Evil,” noting that “[e]ven after the promotional efforts ended, [and] the record was withdrawn from the marketplace, it was carried, as a result of its own momentum, to an additional 10,000 sales and to a rise from approximately number 80 on the ‘Hot Soul Singles’ chart of Billboard magazine to number 61.” These facts established that it was “certain” that the plaintiff had suffered some damage, even though the amount was unclear. On the other hand, the court ruled that claimed damages for lost tours were too speculative to be recovered:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03a2abb2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The same is not true, however, of the existence of damage in the form of lost opportunities for concert tours, theatrical tours or similar benefits. While it is certain that some sales were lost as a result of the failure to promote, we cannot believe that . . . the New York courts would accept what Famous’ counsel aptly described at trial as Contemporary’s “domino theory” of prospective damages. The theory is that if “Fear No Evil” had become a “hit,” its success would have stimulated additional sales of the full two-record VIRGIN album and would have generated sufficient popular acceptance to enable Contemporary to obtain bookings for a nationwide concert tour. We hold that these additional benefits are too dependent upon taste or fancy to be considered anything other than speculative and uncertain, and, therefore, proof of damage in the form of such lost benefits was properly excluded by Judge Owen.</p>

<li class=""><p id="03a2abb4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Limitation of consequential damages to prevent injustice.</i> In subsection (3) of §351, the drafters of Restatement (Second) have proposed a limitation on consequential damages (and perhaps on other forms of damage as well) in addition to the <i>Hadley</i> rule, in cases where “justice so requires in order to avoid disproportionate compensation.” Comment <i>f</i> expands somewhat on this open-ended criterion, by indicating that the limitation is intended to apply in cases where there is extreme disproportion between the price charged by the defendant under the contract in question and the liability sought to be imposed on it. The comment also suggests that informality of agreement and a noncommercial setting ought to be factors tending toward application of the suggested limitation. Professor Farnsworth, Reporter for this portion of Restatement (Second), concedes that §351(3)’s “frank recognition of the judicial reluctance” to award damages that are disproportionate to the consideration paid is “untraditional.” He explains the proposed rule as being designed to permit the courts to do overtly what they have in many cases accomplished covertly through particularly rigorous application of the foreseeability and certainty tests. E. Allan Farnsworth, Contracts §12.17, at 808-810 (4th ed. 2004). Because Section 351(3) is unconventional, only a few courts have relied on it to <span title="920" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-920">p. 920</span>limit recovery of consequential damages. See Totaro, Duffy, Cannova and Co., L.L.C. v. Lane, Middleton &amp; Co., L.L.C., 921 A.2d 1100 (N.J. 2007).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03a2abb5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Proof of lost profits.</i> As <i>Florafax International</i> shows, proof of lost profits typically requires expert testimony, and experts can vary widely in their assumptions and in their resulting projections of future lost profits. In computing expected lost profits, the plaintiff is only entitled to recover net as opposed to gross profits. See footnote 5 of the opinion. Why should this be the case? The court in <i>Florafax International</i> affirmed the jury’s award of $820,000 in expenses for setting up a call center to perform functions that GTE had contracted to perform. Was the award of these expenses inconsistent with the principle that the injured party is only entitled to recover net profits?</p>
<p id="03a2d2c6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Breach of a commercial contract can lead to lost profit as in <i>Florafax International.</i> Sometimes the injured party will claim that the breach of contract resulted in a decline of the value of that party’s business. In such cases care must be taken to avoid double recovery. The plaintiff is generally not entitled to recover both the decline in market value of its business and the present value of the future net income from the business because these two methods are normally alternative ways of measuring the same injury. “According to economic theory, . . . market price should be approximately equal to the present value of all the income that can be derived far into the future from the business.” Johnson v. Oroweat Foods Co., 785 F.2d 503, 507 (4th Cir. 1986). In practice, however, these two measures may differ quite substantially. For example, in Protectors Insurance Service, Inc. v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., 132 F.3d 612 (10th Cir. 1998), the plaintiff’s expert testified that the decline in market value of the plaintiff’s insurance agency resulting from the defendant’s breach of contract was $35,000. Other evidence projected plaintiff’s lost profits at $809,650. The Tenth Circuit reversed the jury’s special verdict allowing both measures of damages and instead awarded the plaintiff $35,000. The court indicated that decline in market value was the preferred measure, and that lost profits should be awarded only “where no other reliable method of valuing the business is available.” Id. at 618.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03a2d2c7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The new business rule.</i> Plaintiffs have traditionally encountered great difficulty in recovering lost profits in a new business venture, or at least a new one for the plaintiff, with no history of prior profitability. Over the years courts have been unreceptive to such claims, often denying recovery as a matter of law for lost profits suffered by new businesses, an approach that came to be referred to as the “new business rule.” Many recent decisions, however, have rejected a strict application of this rule and have allowed new businesses to recover lost profits provided that they are proved with reasonable certainty. See Erdman Co. v. Phoenix Land &amp; Acquisition, LLC, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 100434 (W.D. Ark.) (recognizing that majority of courts have rejected strict application of a new business rule).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03a2d2c8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Consequential damages in other cases.</i> Consequential damage claims can arise in a wide variety of cases. In a lending contract, the borrower may claim that <span title="921" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-921">p. 921</span>the lender’s breach of the contract caused it to lose not only a favorable interest rate on the loan (general damages) but also profits from transactions that were prevented because the funds from the loan were unavailable. Such claims may run afoul of the requirements of mitigation (the borrower should have and could have borrowed money elsewhere, even if it had to pay a higher rate of interest, to mitigate the injury from the lender’s breach) or foreseeability (the lender did not have reason to foresee that the borrower would be unable to obtain needed funds from any other source). The Restatement in Comment <i>e</i> to §351 indicates that consequential damages may be recovered in some cases for breach of a contract to lend money, and courts have allowed such awards if the requirements of mitigation, foreseeability, and certainty have been met. See, e.g., Basic Capital Management, Inc. v. Dynex Commercial, Inc., 348 S.W.3d 894 (Tex. 2011) (consequential damages may be recovered as foreseeable result of breached financing agreement if lender knew purpose of loan at time contract was made and that only less favorable financing alternatives would likely be available).</p>
<p id="03a2d2c9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In some cases employees have claimed as consequential damages harm to their reputation flowing from the employer’s breach. Such claims have usually been made by employees in professions where reputation is particularly important, such as acting or the media. English courts have allowed such claims, but American courts have been much less willing to do so unless the employee can show the loss of a particular opportunity, not simply harm to the employee’s general reputation. Compare Herbert Clayton &amp; Jack Waller, Ltd. v. Oliver, [1930] A.C. 209 (employee entitled not only to lost salary but also to compensation for the loss of valuable publicity), with Ericson v. Playgirl, Inc., 140 Cal. Rptr. 921, 926 (Ct. App. 1977) (defendant not liable to plaintiff for failure to feature his nude photo on cover of its Best of Playgirl magazine, as promised; value to plaintiff of lost publicity too “speculative and conjectural” — “as unpredictable as the lottery and the roulette wheel”), and Redgrave v. Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc., 855 F.2d 888 (1st Cir. 1988), <i>cert. denied,</i> 488 U.S. 1043 (1989) (actress could recover consequential damages for loss of “identifiable professional opportunities,” as contrasted with harm to her general reputation, when symphony canceled her appearance allegedly because of political statements; recovery of damages not subject to higher standard applicable to First Amendment claims because BSO’s cancellation was not “symbolic speech”).</p></li>

<p id="03a2d2cc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the preceding section we considered various rules that courts may employ to calculate the amount of the plaintiff’s “loss in value” or “other loss,” as Restatement (Second) §347 uses those terms. There are, however, a number of off-setting factors that may have the effect of reducing the plaintiff’s recovery <span title="922" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-922">p. 922</span>or even eliminating it altogether. At this point, we turn our attention to those minus factors, items that are to be subtracted from “total loss” in calculating the damages the plaintiff ought to receive. Restatement (Second) §347 refers to these generally as “cost avoided” and “loss avoided”; they are often referred to in the cases and commentary as instances of “mitigation of damages.”</p>
<p id="03a2d2cd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The field of tort law is studded with principles that — whether expressed in terms of “contributory negligence,” “comparative negligence,” “assumption of the risk,” or some other label — reflect a common theme: Even if the defendant’s actions have caused harm to the plaintiff, the defendant need not compensate the plaintiff to the extent that the plaintiff’s own actions were a contributing cause of her injury. Given the apparent strength of this principle in Anglo-American jurisprudence, it should not be surprising to find the same notion expressed in the rules of contract law. Here, however, the principle is commonly stated as one of “mitigation” (sometimes “minimization”) of damages: The plaintiff may not recover for those injurious consequences of the defendant’s breach that the plaintiff herself could by reasonable action have avoided. This principle is also referred to — for obvious reasons — as the doctrine of “avoidable consequences.”</p>
<p id="03a2d2ce-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have seen in the example considered earlier that when the owner without justification repudiates a partially completed construction contract, the breach will represent a “loss in value” to the builder (the unpaid portion of the total price), but it will also present an opportunity for savings. Thus, the builder will be freed from the necessity of expending whatever additional sums it would have cost to complete its own performance (“cost avoided”); it may also have the ability to recoup some of the expenditures already made, by reselling materials purchased, or by applying them to some other job (“loss avoided”). These savings are to be deducted from the aggregate loss suffered in order to compute the plaintiff’s net recovery.</p>
<p id="03a2d2cf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These principles of loss avoidance will be honored throughout the area of contract remedies, but their application will vary according to the type of case under consideration. Thus, personal service contracts present different opportunities for loss avoidance than do other types of contracts; land transactions have their own traditional governing rules; difficult problems of cost allocation may be presented where an enterprise is involved in performing several different contracts at once. The cases and materials below explore some of these problems.</p>

<p id="03a2f9ea-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Plaintiff Luten Bridge Co. had entered into a contract to build a bridge for Rockingham County. This contract had been originally authorized by a 3 to 2 vote of the Rockingham County Commission. For some reason, feelings apparently ran high on this topic within the Commission — so high, in fact, that one of the three-member majority that voted for the Luten contract resigned his seat shortly thereafter. Although he later changed his mind and attempted to retract that resignation, neither he nor the other two proponents of the Luten contract attended any further meetings. As a result, the two-person minority, augmented by a new third member, undertook to function as the County Commission. Instructing Luten to stop work on the bridge contract, they took the position that the contract was not binding on the county and that in any case it would not be honored. Luten, gambling perhaps on the possibility that the earlier majority would act to regain control of the Commission, continued with the construction of the bridge. In Luten’s eventual suit to recover damages for the county’s asserted breach of contract, it was held on appeal that the repudiation of Luten’s contract amounted to a total breach of contract on the <span title="924" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-924">p. 924</span>part of the county. The court then had to consider what damages the plaintiff should recover for this breach. — <span class="epub-small-caps">Eds</span>.]</p>

<p id="03a2f9eb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Coming, then, to the third question — i.e., as to the measure of plaintiff’s recovery — we do not think that, after the county had given notice, while the contract was still executory, that it did not desire the bridge built and would not pay for it, plaintiff could proceed to build it and recover the contract price. It is true that the county had no right to rescind the contract, and the notice given plaintiff amounted to a breach on its part; but, after plaintiff had received notice of the breach, it was its duty to do nothing to increase the damages flowing therefrom. If <i>A</i> enters into a binding contract to build a house for <i>B, B,</i> of course, has no right to rescind the contract without <i>A’s</i> consent. But if, before the house is built, he decides he does not want it, and notifies <i>A</i> to that effect, <i>A</i> has no right to proceed with the building and thus pile up damages. His remedy is to treat the contract as broken when he receives the notice, and sue for the recovery of such damages as he may have sustained from the breach, including any profit which he would have realized upon performance, as well as any other losses which may have resulted to him. In the case at bar, the county decided not to build the road of which the bridge was to be a part, and did not build it. The bridge, built in the midst of the forest, is of no value to the county because of this change of circumstances. When, therefore, the county gave notice to the plaintiff that it would not proceed with the project, plaintiff should have desisted from further work. It had no right thus to pile up damages by proceeding with the erection of a useless bridge.</p>
<p id="03a2f9ec-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The contrary view was expressed by Lord Cockburn in Frost v. Knight, L.R. 7 Ex. 111, but, as pointed out by Prof. Williston (Williston on Contracts, vol. 3, p. 2347), it is not in harmony with the decisions in this country. The American rule and the reasons supporting it are well stated by Prof. Williston as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03a2f9ed-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is a line of cases running back to 1845 which holds that, after an absolute repudiation or refusal to perform by one party to a contract, the other party cannot continue to perform and recover damages based on full performance. This rule is only a particular application of the general rule of damages that a plaintiff cannot hold a defendant liable for damages which need not have been incurred; or, as it is often stated, the plaintiff must, so far as he can without loss to himself, mitigate the damages caused by the defendant’s wrongful act. The application of this rule to the matter in question is obvious. If a man engages to have work done, and afterwards repudiates his contract before the work has been begun or when it has been only partially done, it is inflicting damage on the defendant without benefit to the plaintiff to allow the latter to insist on proceeding with the contract. The work may be useless to the defendant, and yet he would be forced to pay the full contract price. On the other hand, the plaintiff is interested only in the profit he will make out of the contract. If he receives this it is equally advantageous for him to use his time otherwise.</p>
</div>
<p id="03a2f9ee-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The leading case on the subject in this country is the New York case of Clark v. Marsiglia, 1 Denio (N.Y.) 317, 43 Am. Dec. 670. In that case defendant had <span title="925" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-925">p. 925</span>employed plaintiff to paint certain pictures for him, but countermanded the order before the work was finished. Plaintiff, however, went on and completed the work and sued for the contract price. In reversing a judgment for plaintiff, the court said:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03a2f9ef-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff was allowed to recover as though there had been no countermand of the order; and in this the court erred. The defendant, by requiring the plaintiff to stop work upon the paintings, violated his contract, and thereby incurred a liability to pay such damages as the plaintiff should sustain. Such damages would include a recompense for the labor done and materials used, and such further sum in damages as might, upon legal principles, be assessed for the breach of the contract; but the plaintiff had no right, by obstinately persisting in the work, to make the penalty upon the defendant greater than it would otherwise have been.</p>
</div>
<p id="03a2f9f0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And the rule as established by the great weight of authority in America is summed up in the following statement in 6 R.C.L. 1029, which is quoted with approval by the Supreme Court of North Carolina in the recent case of Novelty Advertising Co. v. Farmers’ Mut. Tobacco Warehouse Co., 186 N.C. 197, 119 S.E. 196, 198:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03a2f9f1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While a contract is executory a party has the power to stop performance on the other side by an explicit direction to that effect, subjecting himself to such damages as will compensate the other party for being stopped in the performance on his part at that stage in the execution of the contract. The party thus forbidden cannot afterwards go on, and thereby increase the damages, and then recover such damages from the other party. The legal right of either party to violate, abandon, or renounce his contract, on the usual terms of compensation to the other for the damages which the law recognizes and allows, subject to the jurisdiction of equity to decree specific performance in proper cases, is universally recognized and acted upon.</p>
</div>
<p id="03a2f9f2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . We have carefully considered the cases . . . upon which plaintiff relies; but we do not think that they are at all in point. . . . In the opinions in all of these some language was used which lends support to plaintiff’s position, but in none of them was the point involved which is involved here, viz. whether, in application of the rule which requires that the party to a contract who is not in default do nothing to aggravate the damages arising from breach, he should not desist from performance of an executory contract for the erection of a structure when notified of the other party’s repudiation, instead of piling up damages by proceeding with the work. As stated above, we think that reason and authority require that this question be answered in the affirmative. It follows that there was error in directing a verdict for plaintiff for the full amount of its claim. The measure of plaintiff’s damage, upon its appearing that notice was duly given not to build the bridge, is an amount sufficient to compensate plaintiff for labor and materials expended and expense incurred in the part performance of the contract, prior to its repudiation, plus the profit which would <span title="926" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-926">p. 926</span>have been realized if it had been carried out in accordance with its terms. See Novelty Advertising Co. v. Farmers’ Mut. Tobacco Warehouse Co., supra.</p>
<p id="03a2f9f3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our conclusion, on the whole case, is that there was error in failing to strike out the answer of Pruitt, Pratt, and McCollum, and in admitting same as evidence against the county, in excluding the testimony offered by the county to which we have referred, and in directing a verdict for plaintiff. The judgment below will accordingly be reversed, and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>

<li class=""><p id="03a2f9f7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Counseling Luten.</i> As noted in the summary of facts above, plaintiff Luten appears to have gambled that its friends would be able to reestablish their control over the Rockingham County Commission. While that never happened, the action of the remaining county commissioners in repudiating the county’s contract with the plaintiff was held eventually to have been a breach of that contract (albeit a valid exercise of governmental authority). If the court had held instead that this attempted repudiation of the Luten contract was not in legal contemplation an act of the county commission, what would have been the outcome of this suit? If you represented a modern-day Luten Bridge Co., facing such turmoil in the county commission, what course of action would you advise?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03a2f9f8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The mitigation principle.</i> The principle applied by the court in <i>Rockingham County</i> is often referred to as the “duty to mitigate damages.” As numerous commentators have pointed out, however, it is not strictly speaking a “duty” at all, in the legal sense, any more than the plaintiff in a tort action has a “duty” not to add to his own injury by being contributorily negligent. It is rather a limitation on the plaintiff’s right to recover damages. If the plaintiff in a contract action reasonably could have mitigated his damages, but fails to do so, then — as in the <i>Rockingham County</i> case — he will be unable to shift that portion of his loss to the defendant and will be forced to absorb it himself.

<p id="03a32111-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</b></p>
<p id="03a32112-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff/Appellant Sammie Maness (“Maness”), in his 50s at all pertinent times, lived most of his life in McNairy County, Tennessee. Much of his work life was spent doing hourly work, such as construction, maintenance, working as a mill operator, or working as a carpenter. In 1997, Maness incorporated his own wood manufacturing business in Adamsville, Tennessee, making table tops for a local sewing company. For a couple of years, Maness worked part-time for his new business. In time, the sewing company business diminished, but Maness’s new company began making wooden bases and support parts for bath tubs for Aqua Glass, a local company whose business apparently involved manufacturing bath tubs. As the work from Aqua Glass increased, by 1999, Maness’s company became his full-time occupation. In 2001, Maness’s manufacturing company, Plaintiff SKM Wood Products, LLC (“SKM”), moved to a new facility in Adamsville. Within several years, SKM grew to have annual sales of several million dollars, with approximately twenty-five employees. SKM’s primary customer remained bath tub manufacturer Aqua Glass.</p>
<p id="03a32113-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 2005, Defendant/Appellee Joannie Collins (“Collins”) approached Maness about the possibility of purchasing SKM.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1093F_2c3aca9a-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1093F_2c3aca9a-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">1</a></span> After several meetings, Collins told Maness that her brother-in-law, Defendant/Appellee Mike Smith (“Mike Smith”), and his son, Collins’ nephew, Defendant/Appellee Josh Smith (“Josh Smith”), would be her partners in purchasing and operating the business. Mike Smith took the lead role in negotiating the sale. Not long before the negotiations began, Josh Smith was hospitalized for treatment for drug addiction issues; this fact was not disclosed to Maness during the negotiations.</p>
<p id="03a32115-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The three purchasers expected to take on different roles in the newly acquired business. Collins, a certified public accountant, expected to maintain her full-time employment as a financial advisor and handle the new business’s payroll and financial matters on a part-time basis. Similarly, Mike Smith expected to keep his full-time employment elsewhere and work part-time at SKM. Josh Smith had a college degree in business and marketing and had worked for a woodworking company; he was expected to be the “managing member,” that is, to work full-time at SKM, supervising and managing <span title="928" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-928">p. 928</span>the day-to-day operations. Part of Mike Smith’s motivation in acquiring SKM was to have a business for Josh Smith as well as his other son. All parties expected that, after the acquisition, Maness would remain with SKM as an employee.</p>
<p id="03a32116-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In anticipation of the acquisition, in the fall of 2005, Josh Smith was hired by SKM and began working under Maness’s supervision. Maness was somewhat disappointed by Josh Smith’s job performance at that point, but the record does not indicate that he voiced any concerns about Josh Smith to any of the purchasers.</p>
<p id="03a32117-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On January 13, 2006, the parties executed an asset purchase agreement under which [SKM Wood Products, LLC’s] assets were sold to SKM, LLC, with Collins, Mike Smith, and Josh Smith as guarantors.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10953_2c3aca9a-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10953_2c3aca9a-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">2</a></span> Part of the total $1,300,000 purchase price was paid by a $300,000 promissory note guaranteed by Collins, Mike Smith, and Josh Smith. The new ownership of SKM was structured such that Collins owned one-third, Mike Smith owned one-third, and Josh Smith owned one-third.</p>
<p id="03a32119-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The asset purchase agreement provided for SKM to employ Maness for three years, at an annual salary of $67,600. It stated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03a3211a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As an integral part of this Agreement, the Purchaser [SKM, LLC] agrees to employ Sammie Maness, with the beginning date of such employment to be the date of the closing of this transaction for a period thereafter of not less than three (3) years, provided that the Company shall maintain the current sales volume and for so long as the Company shall not suffer any material interruption of its business by causes beyond its control. During the term of Maness’ employment, he shall generally serve as the Company’s Production Manager and shall be paid an annual salary of Sixty-Seven Thousand Six Hundred Dollars ($67,600.00). . . . </p>
</div>
<p id="03a3211b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Attached to the asset purchase agreement was a job description for Maness as an employee of SKM.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10969_2c3aca9a-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10969_2c3aca9a-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">3</a></span></p>
<p id="03a3211d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the same day, in conjunction with the asset purchase agreement, Maness also signed a non-competition and non-solicitation agreement. The non-competition provision stated that Maness would not:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03a3211e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . for a period of five (5) years following his termination of employment, for whatever reasons, with SKM, LLC by himself or by or through any other person or entity, whether as a shareholder, owner partner, joint venturer, employee, agent, contractor, consultant, directly or indirectly compete with the Company within the Restricted Area. The “Restricted Area” shall mean within the continental United States of America.</p>

<span title="929" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-929">p. 929</span>
<p id="03a3211f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, the noncompetition agreement had a geographic area of the entire continental United States, for a time period of five years after Maness’s employment with SKM ended.</p>
<p id="03a32120-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the effective date of the asset purchase agreement, in mid-January 2006, Maness began his employment as SKM’s Production Manager. As expected, Collins and Mike Smith worked at SKM no more than a few hours per week. Josh Smith worked full-time at SKM. At the time of the purchase, most of SKM’s sales came from customer Aqua Glass. A primary aim of purchasers Collins, Mike Smith and Josh Smith was to bring in additional customers and to diversify SKM’s customer base.</p>
<p id="03a32121-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Initially, the parties’ working relationship was reasonably harmonious. However, conflicts quickly arose. As Maness continued to discipline employees as he always had, the new owners perceived his interactions with the employees as unacceptably confrontational. Maness felt that, under the new ownership, SKM’s employees became increasingly disrespectful toward him.</p>
<p id="03a32122-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The problems came to a head in March 2006, when Maness fired an employee after a heated confrontation in which the employee spoke to Maness in a manner that he perceived as disrespectful of his authority. Afterward, the new owners admonished Maness for the termination and rehired the employee. The new owners indicated to Maness that he did not have the authority to discharge employees.</p>
<p id="03a32123-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Maness’s working relationship with the new owners deteriorated precipitously after that. By all accounts, Maness became unhappy and did much less work, spending considerable time in his office, essentially idle. The parties disputed the reason for Maness’s behavior.</p>
<p id="03a32124-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, on May 16, 2006, the new owners terminated Maness’s employment with SKM. As reason for termination, the termination notice stated: “Have not fulfilled job duties, according to our original agreement, your actions and attitude have been detrimental to the success of this Company.”</p>
<p id="03a32125-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On July 6, 2006, Maness filed a lawsuit in the Chancery Court of McNairy County against Collins, Mike Smith, Josh Smith, and SKM, LLC. The complaint alleged breach of Maness’s employment agreement, and asserted that the non-competition agreement was unenforceable. The complaint sought a judgment for the unpaid compensation under Maness’s employment contract, pre-judgment interest, post-judgment interest, attorney fees and costs, as well as a declaration that the non-competition agreement was unenforceable. . . . </p>
<p id="03a32126-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Maness testified at the outset of the trial. Prior to the acquisition, Maness said, Josh Smith was not a particularly good employee, but Maness was able to work with him on some tasks. After the acquisition, as Maness would walk through the plant correcting employees on transgressions such as safety violations, Maness noticed that the employees acted in an increasingly disrespectful and belligerent manner towards him. After Maness fired the disrespectful problem employee and the new owners reinstated him, Maness said, he told the new owners that they had undercut his authority. Maness said that the new owners responded by telling him that he no longer had the authority to discipline or terminate employees.</p>
<p id="03a32127-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="930" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-930">p. 930</span>After that, Maness claimed, Josh Smith held a meeting with the SKM employees in which he told them that Maness no longer had any authority to correct employees or tell them what to do. Josh Smith did not inform Maness of this meeting. Maness alleged that “every time [he] tried to do anything, correct people, quality, safety or anything, [he] was told that wasn’t [his] job, [and] not to do it.” When he complained, Maness claimed, Mike Smith told him to just stay in his office at his desk and draw his money.</p>
<p id="03a32128-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subsequently, on an occasion when Maness came to SKM at an unusually early hour, he observed Josh Smith in what appeared to be a drug transaction. He told Collins what he had seen. Not long after that, the new owners terminated Maness’s employment.</p>
<p id="03a32129-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On cross-examination, Maness conceded that the new owners told him that his management style was too confrontational; Maness disagreed with their characterization. He also admitted that the new owners wanted to expand SKM’s customer base beyond Aqua Glass, and that he did not care about such expansion.</p>
<p id="03a3483a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since his employment with SKM ended, Maness said, he had not been employed. Maness conceded that, after his termination, he did not seek new employment, but instead focused on building a new house for himself.</p>
<p id="03a3483b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After Maness’s testimony, a former SKM employee testified that Josh Smith talked with him about ideas for getting Maness to leave SKM. The former employee corroborated Maness’s testimony that Josh Smith held a meeting at which SKM employees were told that Maness was no longer an owner, so they did not need to listen to him. Another former SKM employee testified that, several weeks after the acquisition, Josh Smith told employees that Maness would not be with SKM much longer. Both former employees described Josh Smith’s extensive drug use while on the job at SKM and his drug transactions with SKM employees. That concluded Maness’s case-in-chief.</p>
<p id="03a3483c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Collins and Mike Smith both testified that the working relationship with Maness started amicably, but soon inexplicably deteriorated. Both acknowledged that their work time at the SKM plant was limited; for information on Maness’s job performance, they relied in part on Josh Smith and others. . . . </p>
<p id="03a3483d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Collins and Mike Smith both testified that Maness was resistant to the new owners’ efforts to get customers beyond Aqua Glass. Both maintained that, after SKM decided to rehire the problem employee whom Maness had fired, Maness’s work attitude soured and he essentially stopped working. Collins testified that Maness “sulked up like an old possum.” Mike Smith denied telling Maness to just sit in his office and draw his pay. Both Collins and Mike Smith insisted that there was just cause to terminate Maness’s employment.</p>
<p id="03a3483e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Josh Smith testified as well. He said that his drug problems begin in 2005, and that he was addicted to a variety of drugs, prescription and otherwise. . . . Josh Smith admitted that he used drugs on the premises of SKM throughout his employment there. He denied buying or selling drugs on the premises of SKM, and maintained that his drug use did not affect his work performance.</p>
<p id="03a3483f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="931" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-931">p. 931</span>. . . [Josh Smith] maintained that Maness was often confrontational with the employees, and that Maness made no attempt to get new customers. After the new owners rehired the employee Maness had fired, Josh Smith testified, Maness did little work, and began spending most of his work time in his office playing solitaire, and repeatedly asking Collins, Mike Smith, and Josh Smith to buy out the remainder of his contract. Josh Smith confirmed that, at this point, he did not want Maness dealing directly with the employees. He testified that the decision to terminate Maness’s employment was made by he, Collins and Mike Smith together, and that the decision was not made hastily.</p>
<p id="03a34840-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the conclusion of the testimony, the trial court issued an oral ruling. At the outset of its ruling, the trial court noted that no proof had been presented on the enforceability of the noncompete agreement. Consequently, Maness’s claim for declaratory relief on the noncompetition agreement was dismissed without prejudice. The trial court then addressed whether the defendants had breached the employment agreement by terminating Maness’s employment.</p>
<p id="03a34841-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial judge found that Josh Smith was responsible for the daily operations of SKM, and that he suffered from “extreme drug addiction.” It found that Maness’s work performance was generally satisfactory until the new owners rescinded Maness’s firing of the problem employee. After that, the trial court said, “everything went downhill.” The trial judge credited the testimony of witnesses who testified that, unbeknownst to Mike Smith and Collins, Josh Smith attempted to undercut Maness’s authority and to have Maness’s employment terminated. The trial judge observed that Maness, by “sulk[ing] up and sitting at a desk, and saying send me home,” conducted himself in a less-than-professional manner, but the trial judge noted as well that Maness was dealing daily with “a drug-addicted business owner,” namely, Josh Smith. The trial court found that the defendants did not meet their burden of proof to show just cause for terminating Maness’s employment under the employment agreement.</p>
<p id="03a34842-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Regarding the issue of damages, the trial court noted that, after his termination, Maness spent a year building a house and did not take any action to seek employment. The trial court found that Maness, as a wrongfully terminated employee, had a duty to mitigate his damages, but instead took no action. At that point, the trial court asked the attorneys for argument on the issue of mitigation of damages. Maness’s attorney argued that the defendants’ attorney had the burden to show that there was comparable, suitable employment available to Maness, had he looked for a job. Especially in light of the noncompetition agreement, he contended, the defendants’ burden was not met. In response, the defendants’ attorney argued that, since Maness made no effort to find work, employer SKM had no obligation to show the availability of substantially similar employment in the geographic area. After hearing the arguments, the trial judge determined that, in light of Maness’s failure to make any effort to find work, Maness failed to mitigate his damages. It concluded that Maness’s failure to mitigate damages prohibited any award for damages. . . . </p>

<p id="03a34846-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We consider first the issue raised on appeal by [the defendants], that the trial court erred in determining that SKM breached the employment agreement with Maness by terminating Maness’s employment without cause. They assert that Maness was terminated for cause, citing the description of good cause for termination contained in Biggs v. Reinsman Equestrian Products, Inc., 169 S.W.3d 218, 221 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2004) . . . (“good cause exists . . . where the discharge is objectively reasonable.”).</p>
<p id="03a34847-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">SKM, Collins, Mike Smith, and Josh Smith acknowledge that the trial court’s finding of no cause was based in part on the trial court’s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses. They argue that Josh Smith’s admitted drug use was no excuse for Maness to “sulk” and refuse to do his job. Relying on Maness’s own testimony and the testimony of witnesses credited by the trial court, they argue that the undisputed proof shows that Maness utilized an inappropriately confrontational management style when dealing with SKM employees, and that he spent most of his time at work doing nothing or playing games on his computer. They assert that Maness’s “failure to perform express or implied duties” gave SKM the right to terminate his employment contract for cause, prior to the expiration of its term, without incurring liability, citing <i>Biggs</i>, 169 S.W.3d at 221. . . . </p>
<p id="03a34848-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Tennessee has long adhered to the doctrine of employment-at-will, which recognizes the right of either the employer or the employee to terminate the employment relationship at any time, for good cause, bad cause, or no cause at all, without being guilty of a legal wrong. . . . Cummings, Inc. v. Dorgan, 320 S.W.3d 316, 332 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2009). In Tennessee, employees are presumed to be employed at will in the absence of an agreement for employment for a term certain. [Id.]. . . . </p>
<p id="03a34849-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the case at bar, the asset purchase agreement provides for Maness’s employment by SKM for a term of three years. Often, an employment contract for a term certain will expressly provide that the employee may be terminated “for cause” or “for good cause.” See, e.g., Worley v. Lister Distribution, Inc., No. E2005-02932-COA-R3-CV, 2006 Tenn. App. LEXIS 419, 2006 WL 1684748 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 20, 2006). In this case, the employment agreement contains no such language. It states only that SKM “agrees to employ [Maness] for a period . . . of not less than three (3) years . . . .” The only stated proviso to SKM’s obligation to employ Maness is that SKM maintain its sales volume and not suffer any “material interruption of its business.” The record contains no indication of a business interruption for SKM, and the trial court specifically found that SKM’s sales volume had increased. The contract indicates no other circumstance under which SKM is relieved of its <span title="933" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-933">p. 933</span>obligation to employ Maness for the mandated term. Thus, under the plain language of the employment agreement, SKM had an essentially unqualified obligation to employ Maness for a period of three years, at a salary of $67,600 per year. . . . </p>
<p id="03a3484a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, there is authority in Tennessee to the effect that, even where an employment agreement is for a definite term, the employer may nevertheless discharge the employee for just cause. See Trabue, Inc. v. Professional Management-Automotive, Inc., 589 S.W.2d 661, 663 (Tenn. 1970); . . . . Thus, we assume that, despite the unambiguous language in Maness’s employment agreement, SKM retained the right to terminate his employment for just cause.</p>
<p id="03a3484b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As noted by SKM and the new owners, the trial court found that Maness “was sulked up and sitting at a desk,” and “saying send me home.” We agree that this indicates that Maness did not perform his job duties under the employment contract. Viewed in isolation, this could be seen as cause for termination under the case law cited by SKM, Collins, Mike Smith, and Josh Smith. See <i>Biggs</i>, 169 S.W.3d at 221 (“Sub-performance that compromises the employer’s interest or impedes the company’s progress will justify the termination for cause.”) (citations omitted); . . . . </p>
<p id="03a3484c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court, however, did not view Maness’s actions in isolation; rather, it viewed Maness’s failure to perform his function as Production Manager in the context of the workplace disruption it found that Josh Smith created. . . . </p>
<p id="03a3484d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our courts have recognized that each party to a contract is “under an implied obligation to restrain from doing any act that would delay or prevent the other party’s performance of the contract” and that “[e]ach party has the right to proceed free of hindrance by the other party.” ACG, Inc. v. Southeast Elevator, Inc., 912 S.W.2d 163, 168 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1995). In German v. Ford, 300 S.W.3d 692, 706 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2009), this Court elaborated on this principle:</p>

This factual finding hinged on the trial court’s assessment of the witnesses’ credibility. Josh Smith’s disavowal of any such actions was not credited by the trial court. Instead, the testimony of Maness and the former SKM employees, that Josh Smith fomented dissent against Maness, undercut his authority, and sought to get rid of him, was credited. . . . This means that SKM and the new owners were without cause to terminate his employment, and that Maness may recover under the contract. Therefore, we affirm the finding of the trial court that Maness was terminated from his employment without cause.</p>

<p id="03a36f65-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the substantive issue of mitigation of damages, Maness asserts that the trial court erred in declining to award Maness damages where there was no evidence at trial that comparable, suitable employment was available to Maness. Maness maintains that, under Frye v. Memphis State Univ., 806 S.W.2d 170 (Tenn. 1991), it would have been futile for Maness to seek other employment. Id. at 173. He contends that the noncompetition agreement, prohibiting employment with a competitor anywhere in the United States for a period of five years, prevented him from seeking comparable employment.</p>
<p id="03a36f66-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Maness asserts that, under <i>Frye</i>, “the employer must prove both the availability of suitable and comparable substitute employment and a lack of reasonable diligence on the part of the employee.” Id.

<p id="03a36f67-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In response, SKM and the new owners note that, without question, Maness had a duty to mitigate his damages, and that it is undisputed that he made no effort whatsoever to find substitute employment.

They argue somewhat hopefully on appeal that this case would be an excellent opportunity for this Court to adopt the exception noted in the case of Barnes v.

<p id="03a36f6b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the instant case, Maness seeks damages for the breach of his employment contract; he contends that, had his employment not been wrongfully terminated, he would have been paid the agreed-upon salary for three years. “Although liability for breach of contract is primarily based on a no-fault principle, . . . a party who has been wronged by a breach of contract may not unreasonably sit idly by and allow damages to accumulate.” [Joseph M. Perillo, Calamari And Perillo On Contracts 584 Thomson West (5th ed. 2003).] This is the doctrine of avoidable consequences, often referred to as the plaintiff’s obligation to mitigate his damages. See 22 Am. Jur. 2d Damages §§340, 345, 360 (2010). Thus, where a party seeks damages for breach of contract, courts will enforce the plaintiff’s duty to mitigate or reduce his damages incurred after the other party’s breach. See Feldman 22 Tenn. Prac. Contract Law And Practice §2:32 (2010). In the context of the breach of an employment contract by the employer, the terminated employee’s damages “consist of compensation that the employee who has been wrongfully discharged would have received if the contract had been carried out according to its terms, provided that the employee has been unable to find comparable employment . . . .” 22 Am. Jur. 2d §101 (2010). See <i>Frye</i>, 806 S.W.2d at 173. . . . </p>
<p id="03a36f6c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The failure to mitigate damages is an affirmative defense. Id. In Tennessee, “the employer must prove both availability of suitable and comparable substitute employment and a lack of reasonable diligence on the part of the employee.” <i>Frye</i>, 806 S.W.2d at 173. In light of their failure to proffer evidence of suitable comparable substitute employment for Maness, SKM and the new owners urge this Court to adopt the exception referred to in <i>Barnes</i>. We must respectfully decline to do so. First, adopting such an exception renders problematic the calculation of the plaintiff employee’s damages. The plaintiff’s failure to mitigate his damages does not <i>per se</i> preclude him from recovering any damages whatsoever; rather, “recovery is diminished only to the extent that the plaintiff fails to mitigate the damages as they would be mitigated by an ordinary, reasonable person under similar circumstances.” 22 Am. Jur. 2d §336 (2010). Thus, only the amount that the plaintiff would have earned in the exercise of reasonable diligence is applied to reduce his contractual damages. See, e.g., <i>Barnes</i>, 2001 Tenn. App. LEXIS 384, 2001 WL 568033, at *5 (“A back pay award must be reduced by any . . . amounts that [the employee] could have earned had the employee exercised reasonable diligence.”) (citations omitted). Therefore, the plaintiff is precluded from recovering damages <i>only</i> if the proof shows that the amount he would have earned in the exercise of reasonable diligence equaled or exceeded the amount he would have earned under the original employment agreement. See, e.g., <i>Denney</i>, 2006 Tenn. App. LEXIS 469, 2006 WL 1915303, at *10. If no proof of comparable, suitable substitute employment is presented to the trial court, then the trial court has no basis on which to determine the amount by which the plaintiff’s damages should be reduced.</p>

First, this argument was not raised in the trial court, and consequently cannot appropriately be raised for the first time on appeal. See Coleman Management, Inc. v. Meyer, 304 S.W.3d 340, 355 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2009). Here, not only was the argument not raised to the trial court, but in this case the trial court expressly declined to consider the noncompetition agreement or Maness’s request for declaratory relief that it was unenforceable.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A89_2c3aca9a-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10A89_2c3aca9a-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">8</a></span></p>
<p id="03a36f6f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, whatever the effect of such a provision in the consideration of whether the noncompetition agreement is enforceable, it does not obviate the need for the employer to submit evidence of suitable, comparable employment to prove the plaintiff’s failure to mitigate damages. As noted above, the plaintiff’s recovery is only diminished by the amount he would have earned in the exercise of reasonable diligence. A contractual acknowledgement that he could find “alternative, commensurate employment or work” is not equivalent to a stipulation that Maness would have earned compensation that equaled or exceeded the compensation he would have received pursuant to the employment agreement with SKM. Thus, even if the trial court had been presented with this argument, consideration of the language in the noncompete provision would not have enabled the trial court to determine the <i>amount</i> by which Maness’s damages should be reduced. Therefore, in the absence of evidence that suitable alternative employment was available to Maness, [the defendants] cannot rely on the affirmative defense of mitigation of damages. . . . </p>

We reverse the trial court’s holding that Maness’s failure to mitigate his damages precludes him from recovering any damages for the breach of his employment contract. The cause must be remanded to the trial court for entry of judgment in favor of Maness and for calculation of Maness’s damages resulting from the breach of Article 8 of the asset purchase agreement.

<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-decimal">
<li class=""><p id="03a39685-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Measuring damages for breach by an employer</i>. The <i>Maness</i> court found that the conduct of Sammie Maness in “sulking” and spending long hours “playing solitaire” resulted from his employer’s prior bad faith conduct. In that regard, is the court’s discussion of the implied duty of good faith consistent with the approach to that concept found in Chapter 6? Are you convinced that the employer breached the contract by terminating Maness?</p>
<p id="03a39686-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once the courts found that the employer breached the contract in this case, the measurement of damages for Sammie Maness appeared rather simple: The amount of salary he would have received during the rest of the contract term minus any sum that was earned or reasonably could have been earned through mitigation. In other cases of employer breach, however, there can be complicated issues concerning how many years an employee would have worked before retirement, whether the employee would have received raises or bonuses, what to do about vacation pay, etc. See, e.g., Havill v. Woodstock Soapstone Company, Inc., 865 A.2d 335 (Vt. 2004).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03a39687-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Employer’s burden of proof regarding mitigation</i>. As a general rule, most courts agree with the <i>Maness</i> court that the burden of proving that the employee failed to mitigate damages rests with the employer. See, e.g., Howard Univ. v. Roberts-Williams, 37 A.3d 896 (D.C. 2012) (mitigation is an affirmative defense with burden on the employer). The trial court in <i>Maness</i> found that Sammie Maness had failed to make any efforts to mitigate his damages and therefore should recover no damages. Accord, Mihalik v. Credit Agricole Chevreux North America, Inc., 2015 WL 13699239 (S.D.N.Y.). Consistent with the approach of the appellate court in <i>Maness</i>, however, many other courts have imposed on the employer the burden of showing not only that the employee failed to act reasonably in seeking other jobs but also that there were comparable positions that could have been obtained. See Ascare v. Mastercard Int’l, Inc., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115427 (E.D. Mo. 2012); Bolanos v. Priority Business Services, Inc., 2018 WL 1224655 (Cal. Ct. App.). Do you agree that the burden of proof regarding mitigation should be allocated to the employer even when the employee makes no effort at all?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03a39688-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Statutory rights and mitigation</i>. The <i>Maness</i> case involved a claim by the employee for common law breach of contract. Since the 1960s there has been a proliferation of federal and state statutes intended to protect employees from discrimination on certain prohibited bases. See generally Marcia L. McCormick, The Truth Is Out There: Revamping Federal Antidiscrimination Enforcement <span title="938" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-938">p. 938</span>for the Twenty-First Century, 30 Berkeley J. Emp. &amp; Lab. L. 193, 200-204 (2009) (noting federal and sometimes state law offer employee protection based on a number of factors including race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, and disability). Thus, employees will frequently seek to recover on a statutory basis in addition to or in lieu of breach of contract. In those cases courts tend to require employee mitigation similar to that expected under the common law. See Arbercheski v. Oracle Corp., 650 F. Supp. 2d 309 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (employee pursuing Title VII discrimination claim had obligation to make reasonable efforts to obtain comparable employment).</p></li>

Red Lion Inn, 943 P.2d 431 (Colo. 1997) (en banc), Red Lion discharged Fair when she attempted to return to work from a medical leave granted to allow recovery from injuries suffered in an automobile accident. With the assistance of legal counsel, Fair challenged the grounds for her termination and Red Lion offered her old job back. Fair declined the offer because she feared she would be fired again in retaliation for the dispute, she had concerns about physical aspects of her job due to having become pregnant, and she had doubts about her benefits under the proposed reinstatement. Fair brought suit; the jury found Red Lion liable for $140,000 plus interest. The Colorado Supreme Court reversed. The court stated that it did not “question the reasonableness of Fair’s apprehensions,” but any employee (or for that matter any contracting party) would have apprehensions about the other party’ performance after a breach. The court concluded:</p>

<p id="03a3968a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nonetheless, sound principles of contract law in the commercial and employment setting . . . ordain the principles we acknowledge today: The injured party claiming breach of an employment agreement has a duty to mitigate or minimize damages. In the employment agreement context, such duty includes the acceptance of an unconditional offer of reinstatement where no special circumstances exist to justify rejection.</p>

<p id="03a3968b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Id. at 442. What “special circumstances” would justify rejection of an employer’s unconditional offer of reemployment? See Restatement (Second) of Contracts §350(1) (damages are not recoverable if they can be avoided without “undue risk, burden or humiliation”); Pyramid Printing Co. v. Alaska State Commission, 153 P.3d 994 (Alaska 2007) (constructively discharged employee not obligated to accept reinstatement offer that would involve substantial contact with supervisor who caused hostile working environment).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03a3968c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The</i> <b><i>Parker</i></b> <i>case</i>. In discussing the issue of mitigation, the court in <i>Maness</i> also espouses the commonly held view that the employee need only mitigate with alternative work that is “comparable” to the position lost. This limitation on the duty to mitigate was the central issue in the widely discussed decision of the California Supreme Court in Parker v. Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp., 474 P.2d 689 (Cal. 1970) (en banc). In <i>Parker</i>, plaintiff (known professionally as Shirley MacLaine) sued to recover damages for the defendant’s breach of a contract to employ her as the star of a major musical motion picture entitled <span title="939" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-939">p. 939</span>“Bloomer Girl”; the defendant argued that the plaintiff had rejected a postbreach offer from the defendant to star in a nonmusical motion picture for identical compensation and for that reason should not recover any damages. A majority of the California Supreme Court upheld the trial court’s ruling that the second offer was not a truly comparable one, principally because the two pictures were of different types and because the second opportunity did not provide the plaintiff with the same approvals of director, and the like, that she would have had under the first one. In a vigorous dissent, Justice Sullivan had the following to say about the extent of the plaintiff’s “duty” to mitigate the loss of her contracted-for employment:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03a3968d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The employee need not accept] employment which is of a <i>different kind</i>. . . . It has never been the law that the mere existence of <i>differences between two jobs in the same field</i> is sufficient, as a matter of law, to excuse an employee wrongfully discharged from one from accepting the other in order to mitigate damages. Such an approach would effectively eliminate any obligation of an employee to attempt to minimize damage arising from a wrongful discharge. The only alternative job offer an employee would be required to accept would be an offer of his former job by his former employer.</p>
<p id="03a3968e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the majority appear to hold that there was a difference “in kind” between the employment offered plaintiff in “Bloomer Girl” and that offered in “Big Country” . . . , an examination of the opinion makes crystal clear that the majority merely point out differences between the two <i>films</i> (an obvious circumstance) and then apodically [sic — apodictically?] assert that these constitute a difference in the <i>kind</i> of <i>employment</i>. The entire rationale of the majority boils down to this: that the “<i>mere circumstances</i>” that “Bloomer Girl” was to be a musical review while “Big Country” was a straight drama “demonstrates the difference in kind” since a female lead in a western is not “the equivalent of or substantially similar to” a lead in a musical. This is merely attempting to prove the proposition by repeating it. . . . </p>
</div>
<p id="03a3bd9f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Id. at 696. Justice Sullivan also observed that many of the early cases held that an employee is not required to accept employment in an “inferior rank or position nor work which is more menial or arduous.” He suggested that the rule may therefore “have had its origin in the bourgeois fear of resubmergence in lower economic classes.” Id. at 695 n.2. Is the dissenting justice in <i>Parker</i> right in suggesting that this rule is an outmoded relic of concern for “bourgeois” interests? Or are there persuasive reasons for maintaining such an approach today?</p>
<p id="03a3bda0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The facts of <i>Parker</i> are more complex than the opinions in that case suggest. The original “Bloomer Girl” was a 1944 Broadway musical comedy set at the time of the Civil War and suggested by the career of Amelia Jenks (“Dolly”) Bloomer, a nineteenth-century crusader for women’s rights. Although essentially light entertainment, it did have strong themes of both feminism and racial justice. Plaintiff Parker (MacLaine) has publicly professed strong commitment to both causes. Would these facts have been relevant to the question <span title="940" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-940">p. 940</span>of whether for her the second film was indeed a “comparable employment”? (It might also be noted that the full title of the substitute, “western-type” film offered to MacLaine was “Big Country, <i>Big Man</i>” (emphasis supplied).) For further discussion of the issues in <i>Parker</i>, see Mary Joe Frug, Re-Reading Contracts: A Feminist Analysis of a Contracts Casebook, 34 Am. U. L. Rev. 1065, 1114-1125 (1985).</p>
<p id="03a3bda1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professor Victor Goldberg has argued that the <i>Parker</i> court was wrong even to apply the doctrine of mitigation of damages, because her contract had a “pay-or-play” clause. Such clauses, which are common in many fields, give one party (Fox in this case) what amounts to an option to either perform under the contract or to pay the amount set forth in the clause. (Recall Sondra Locke’s agreement with Warner Brothers discussed in the <i>Locke</i> case in Chapter 6.) As Professor Goldberg sees the case, Fox had the right to have MacLaine perform in “Bloomer Girl” or to pay her the contractually agreed upon amount; application of the doctrine of mitigation would have been inappropriate because it would have deprived Parker of a contractual entitlement. Victor P. Goldberg, Bloomer Girl Revisited or How to Frame an Unmade Picture, 1998 Wis. L. Rev. 1051.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03a3bda2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Effect of other income</i>. Even though the wrongfully discharged plaintiff has no “duty” to mitigate by taking employment that is not comparable to that promised by the defendant, if she does indeed take another different job, the amounts earned there from are likely to be set off against her damages recoverable for breach of contract. See, e.g., Marshall School District v. Hill, 939 S.W.2d 319 (Ark. Ct. App. 1997) (wrongfully discharged teacher’s recovery reduced by income earned from other jobs, including work in shirt factory); Cheathem v. Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist., 2017 WL 3498917 (Cal. Ct. App.) (rejecting conflicting authority, court holds amount employee earned from other employment, whether comparable or not, should be deducted from recovery to avoid “windfall”). Why should this be the case? Does this rule undercut the policy, discussed above, of not requiring an employee to seek dissimilar employment when wrongfully discharged? There are, however, some situations in which a new contract entered into after breach will not be considered to be a mitigating one. The next principal case, Jetz Service Co. v. Salina Properties, explores this issue.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03a3bda3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Mitigation in the UCC</i>. Although the Uniform Commercial Code has no provision imposing a general responsibility of mitigation on the parties to a sales contract, Comment 1 to UCC §1-305 indicates this notion was intended to be subsumed in the more general principle that remedies are to be limited to compensation. The Comment also suggests that minimization of damages may be implicit in the more general obligation of good faith imposed by §1-304. The remedies provisions of Article 2 contain a number of specific references to actions by the buyer or the seller intended to have the effect of minimizing the loss or damage incurred by reason of the other party’s breach, most specifically §2-715(2)(a), which states that a buyer is not entitled to consequential damages <span title="941" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-941">p. 941</span>unless loss could not have been reasonably prevented by making “cover” or a substitute contract. The remedies under Article 2 are discussed in more detail in Section E of this chapter.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03a3bda4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Mitigation in real estate leases</i>. The duty to mitigate has generally not been applied to real estate leases. Reflecting the principle that a lease of land was considered as a conveyance of an interest in real property (rather than merely a contract to permit its occupancy by someone other than the owner), defaulting tenants were traditionally held to their duty to pay the rent in full, with no obligation on the landlord’s part to minimize loss by attempting to re-rent to another. See Restatement (Second) of Property §12.1(3) (1977). More recently, most American jurisdictions have by decision or statute adopted the position that real estate leases should be treated more like other contracts, with the landlord in the event of the tenant’s abandonment having a “duty to mitigate” similar to that imposed on other contracting parties. See Frenchtown Square Partnership v. Lemstone, 791 N.E.2d 417 (Ohio 2003) (asserting that majority trend favors imposing duty to mitigate in all real property leases).</p>
<p id="03a3bda5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not all courts agree with the modern trend, however. In 1995 a unanimous New York Court of Appeals adhered to the traditional rule that a landlord does not have a duty to mitigate damages. Holy Properties Ltd. v. Kenneth Cole Productions, Inc., 661 N.E.2d 694 (N.Y. 1995). See Jeremy Sheff, A Tale of Two Cities: The Residential Landlord’s Duty to Mitigate in New York, 25 J. Civ. Rts. &amp; Econ. Dev. 673 (2011) (advocating for equitable flexibility by courts in deciding whether particular residential landlord should have duty to mitigate).</p></li>

<p id="03a3bdac-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Salina Properties appeals the damages awarded to Jetz Service Co., Inc., resulting from breach of the parties’ lease of space in which coin-operated laundry equipment was installed in an apartment complex.</p>
<p id="03a3bdad-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Jetz Service supplies and maintains coin-operated laundry equipment in approximately 2,000 locations in an eight-state area. It constantly seeks locations for installation of laundry equipment which is furnished from several warehouses in which an inventory of approximately 1,500 used washers and dryers is always available.</p>
<p id="03a3bdae-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In May of 1987, Salina Properties’ predecessor in title leased 175 square feet of an apartment complex to Jetz Service for use as a coin-operated laundry facility.

<p id="03a3e4bf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The lease was for a six-year term. Jetz Service paid an initial $3,000 decorating allowance and was entitled to the first $300 per month or 50%, whichever was greater, of the gross receipts from the machines during the term of the <span title="942" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-942">p. 942</span>lease. The lease stated the parties assumed the duties of a landlord and tenant under the laws of Kansas.</p>
<p id="03a3e4c0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In July of 1992, with 16 months remaining on the term of the lease, Salina Properties disconnected all of Jetz Service’s equipment and replaced it with its own laundry equipment.</p>
<p id="03a3e4c1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Jetz Service retrieved its property at a cost of $187.50 and stored the washers and dryers in one of its warehouses. Four sets of the laundry equipment were re-leased in the Kansas City area in January 1993, although other suitable laundry equipment was available to complete this transaction.</p>
<p id="03a3e4c2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Jetz Service sued Salina Properties to recover its lost profits for the remaining 16 months of the lease. It requested damages equal to one-half of the anticipated gross income for the remainder of the lease. Salina Properties raised numerous defenses but essentially relied on its argument that Jetz Services had failed to mitigate its damages and should only recover the cost of moving its equipment.</p>
<p id="03a3e4c3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court determined Jetz Service was a “lost volume” lessee and had sustained loss of profits and damages in the amount Jetz Service requested. Salina Properties received credit for one month of unpaid rent but Jetz Service was granted judgment for damages of $6,383.08 and $2,165 in attorney fees.</p>
<p id="03a3e4c4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Salina Properties appeals the award of damages. It does not contest the trial court’s finding that it was subject to the lease and that its actions in removing Jetz Service’s property constituted a breach of the lease agreement.</p>
<p id="03a3e4c5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The two principal contentions Salina Properties raises by this appeal are that Jetz Service (1) failed, as a matter of law, to mitigate its damages and (2) failed to prove the requisite elements to recover lost profits. The underlying issue of most importance, however, is the trial court’s finding that Jetz Service should be treated as a “lost volume” lessee and is entitled to recover its expected gross receipts for the remaining term of the lease notwithstanding the fact it utilized part of the laundry equipment before the term of the Salina lease expired.</p>

We would be required, however, to reduce the award for the damages awarded for the breach of the final 10 months of the lease because 80% (8 of the 10 machines) of the laundry equipment was placed into usage in the Kansas City area lease. We are not willing to reach this result because we agree with the trial court’s determination that Jetz Service is a “lost volume” lessee, a concept which has not previously been considered by our Kansas courts.</p>

<p id="03a40be0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The “lost volume seller” measure of damages “refers to the lost volume of business the non-breaching seller incurs on buyer’s breach. When the seller resells the entity he expected to sell to the original buyer, he usually deprives himself of something of value — the sale to a new buyer of another similar entity.” 38 Md. App. at 154 n.3, 380 A.2d 618.</p>

<p id="03a40be2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To illustrate, assume a contract for the sale of a washing machine with a list price of $500. Assume further that the seller has or can obtain more machines than he can sell. The buyer breaches, and the seller resells that washing machine at the same list price the buyer had been willing to pay. However, the resale buyer is one of seller’s regular customers who had intended to purchase a washing machine from him anyway. If the seller’s total cost per machine was $300, he stood to gain an aggregate profit of $400, that is, $200 profit from each of two sales. Clearly the 2-708 contract-market differential formula is inadequate in this situation since it gives no damages to the seller who has lost a $200 profit because of the breach. In such a case the damage award should be the lost profit, that is, $200, for this will place the seller “in as good a position as performance would have done.” 1 White &amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code §7-9, p. 358 (3d ed. 1988).</p>

If the injured party could and would have entered into the subsequent contract, even if the contract had not been broken, and could have had the benefit of both, he can be said to have “lost volume” and the subsequent transaction is not a substitute for the broken contract. The injured party’s damages are then based on the net profit that he has lost as a result of the broken contract. Since entrepreneurs try to operate at optimum capacity, however, it is possible that an additional transaction would not have been profitable and that the injured party would not have chosen to expand his business by undertaking it had there been no breach. It is sometimes assumed that he would have done so, but the question is one of fact to be resolved according to the circumstances of each case. See Illustration 16. . . . </p>

Germano, 24 Cal. App. 3d 618, 101 Cal. Rptr. 255 (1972). Seaboard’s lease of a coin-operated juke box and pool table was breached by a tavern operator. The tavern owner claimed that Seaboard was required to mitigate damages by re-leasing the equipment.

<li class=""><p id="03a4330b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Mitigating versus additional contracts.</i> In order for the breaching party to obtain a deduction from its damage liability for income received by the plaintiff from another contract, the breaching party must show that the other contract was a <i>mitigating contract</i>, that is, a contract that the plaintiff was able to perform only because the defendant’s breach freed the plaintiff from the obligation to perform the original contract. If the court finds that the new contract is an <i>additional contract</i> rather than a mitigating one, however (as was the case in <i>Jetz Service</i>), the plaintiff is entitled to the profit from both contracts, and the defendant will not have the benefit of any deduction from its damage liability. As the court in <i>Jetz Service</i> indicates, whether the contract is mitigating or additional is a question of fact. In Rodriguez v. Learjet, Inc., 946 P.2d 1010 (Kan. Ct. App. 1997), the Kansas Court of Appeals amplified its holding in <i>Jetz Service.</i> To establish its status as a lost volume seller, the plaintiff must prove “(1) that it possessed the capacity to make an additional sale, (2) that it would have been profitable for it to make an additional sale, and (3) that it probably would have made an additional sale absent the buyer’s breach.” Id. at 1015. <i>Rodriguez</i> involved a breach of contract to purchase a commercial jet airplane. On the facts of the case Learjet was able to establish that it was a lost volume seller because: (1) it was operating at 60 percent of capacity, (2) accounting <span title="947" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-947">p. 947</span>evidence showed that additional sales could be made profitably, and (3) the company sold the jet that was the subject of the contract to another purchaser at a profit.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03a45a1c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Lost volume sellers under the UCC.</i> The Learjet contract in <i>Rodriguez</i> was governed by Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code since the plane was an item of “goods” as defined in UCC §2-105(1). The courts have been almost unanimous in holding that lost volume sellers of goods, such as Learjet, are entitled to recover their profit under UCC §2-708(2). See James J. White &amp; Robert S. Summers, Uniform Commercial Code §8-9 (6th ed. 2010) (listing cases that have applied §2-708(2) to lost volume sellers). The various remedies available to sellers and buyers under the UCC are discussed later in this chapter.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03a45a1d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Application of the mitigation principle to service contracts.</i> The application of the mitigation principle to service contracts turns on several factors. If the contract is for personal services or employment (as in the <i>Maness</i> case), a new contract entered into after the breach will generally be considered to be a mitigating one since an individual has a limited capacity to perform personal services. In some cases, however, it may be possible for the employee or other provider of services to perform both contracts; in that case the second contract will not be considered a mitigating one. For example, in Gianetti v. Norwalk Hosp., 833 A.2d 891 (Conn. 2003), the plaintiff was a staff plastic surgeon at the defendant hospital, but was also on staff at four other hospitals. The defendant hospital was held to have breached its contract with the plaintiff by failing to renew his appointment. The Connecticut Supreme Court then rejected the defendant’s argument that the physician could not possibly be a “lost volume seller” as a matter of law. The court held that the plaintiff, as a general proposition, could have continued to perform his contract with the defendant hospital in addition to his contracts with the other hospitals. 833 A.2d at 902. See also Restatement (Second) §347, Comment <i>e,</i> Illustration 13. Ultimately, after remand the Connecticut Supreme Court affirmed the award of lost volume seller’s damages to the plaintiff, although for a limited number of years. 43 A.3d 567 (Conn. 2012).</p>
<p id="03a45a1e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the contract does not require personal services (as was the case in <i>Jetz Service</i>), the courts may find it even easier to conclude that a second contract entered into after breach of the first contract is not a mitigating one because the provider of services has the capacity to perform both contracts. The Restatement supports this view. Illustration 10 to §350 provides: “<i>A</i> contracts to pay <i>B</i> $20,000 for paving <i>A</i>’s parking lot, which would give <i>B</i> a net profit of $3,000. <i>A</i> breaks the contract by repudiating it before <i>B</i> begins work. If <i>B</i> would have made the contract with <i>A</i> in addition to other contracts, <i>B</i>’s efforts to obtain other contracts do not affect his damages. <i>B</i>’s damages for <i>A</i>’s breach of contract include his $3,000 loss of profit.” The courts have reached similar decisions. See, e.g., Harvey v. Timber Resources, Inc., 37 S.W.3d 814 (Mo. Ct. App. 2001) (plaintiff contractor entitled to lost profits on timber cutting contract; could have performed both the breached contract and a subsequent contract in the requisite time frame); Kllm Transport Services, LLC <span title="948" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-948">p. 948</span>v. JBS Carriers, Inc., 2015 WL 11005024 (S.D. Miss.) (question of fact whether trucking company could and would have performed other contracts in addition to the breached one; different tests for “lost volume seller” status discussed and compared).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03a45a1f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Calculation of lost profit.</i> If the new contract is viewed as an additional rather than a mitigating contract, the plaintiff is entitled to her “lost profit” from the original contract without deduction of the amount received from the new contract. The determination of lost profit, however, can be tricky. According to standard accounting principles, “profit” means gross income minus cost of the transaction. What is included in the term “cost”? Certain types of costs vary with the particular transaction (“variable costs,” in accounting terminology), while other costs, such as mortgage expenses, officers’ salaries, and general administrative expenses are “fixed costs.” The court in <i>Jetz Service</i> awarded the plaintiff its “gross profit,” defined as gross income less variable costs but without any deduction for a portion of fixed costs that could be allocated to the transaction. However, the determination of lost profits will inevitably turn on the facts of each case. See Gianetti v. Norwalk, Hosp., 43 A.3d 567, 598-601 (Conn. 2012) (adopting “average market approach” to determine plaintiff’s net profits).</p></li>

<p id="03a45a22-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It was earlier suggested that the conventional rule governing contract damages implies both a floor and a ceiling: A plaintiff should ordinarily recover <i>at least</i> her expectation damages; on the other hand, a plaintiff should not recover anything <i>more</i> than that. As we have seen, a plaintiff’s claim for expectation damages will be weighed in light of the doctrine of avoidable consequences; it will also be limited by the requirement that damages be foreseeable (at least where they are “special” or “consequential”) and proven with reasonable certainty. As a result, in many cases the damages actually recoverable will in fact fall short of the true “expectation” of gain that the contract created.</p>
<p id="03a45a23-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this section, we consider three types of damage recovery usually denied to a plaintiff in ordinary actions at common law for breach of contract (although they may be recoverable in other kinds of actions or specifically provided for by statute): damages to compensate the plaintiff for amounts expended on attorney fees; damages for mental distress (and related types of intangible, “noneconomic” injury); and “punitive” (or “exemplary”) damages. In some instances, denial of such recovery will further depress the plaintiff’s award of damages below the level that true expectation would require. (E.g., inability of the plaintiff to recover the full cost of litigation occasioned by the breach means that even if an otherwise fully compensatory damage award is granted, the plaintiff necessarily will be left worse off than she would have been if the contract had <span title="949" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-949">p. 949</span>been performed.) In other cases, to award such damages might well bring the plaintiff’s recovery <i>above</i> the net-expectation level. (This is particularly likely to be true of a sizeable award of punitive damages.) Recent developments suggest that these conventional rules of nonliability are not beyond question. Some evidence of this gradual shift in attitudes may be seen in the materials that follow.</p>

<p id="03a4813a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Zapata, a Mexican corporation that supplied Lenell, a U.S. wholesale baker of cookies, with cookie tins, sued Lenell for breach of contract and won. The district judge ordered Lenell to pay Zapata $550,000 in attorneys’ fees. From that order, which the judge based both on a provision of the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, Jan. 1, 1988, 15 U.S.C. App., and on the inherent authority of the courts to punish the conduct of litigation in bad faith, Lenell appeals.</p>
<p id="03a4813b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Convention, of which both the U.S. and Mexico are signatories, provides, as its name indicates, remedies for breach of international contracts for the sale of goods. Zapata brought suit under the Convention for money due under 110 invoices, amounting to some $900,000 (we round liberally), and also sought prejudgment interest plus attorneys’ fees, which it contended are “losses” within the meaning of the Convention and are therefore an automatic entitlement of a plaintiff who prevails in a suit under the Convention. At the close of the evidence in a one-week trial, the judge granted judgment as a matter of law for Zapata on 93 of the 110 invoices, totaling $850,000. Zapata’s claim for money due under the remaining invoices was submitted to the jury, which found in favor of Lenell. Lenell had filed several counterclaims; the judge dismissed some of them and the jury ruled for Zapata on the others. The jury also awarded Zapata $350,000 in prejudgment interest with respect to the 93 invoices as to which Zapata had prevailed, and the judge then tacked on the attorneys’ fees — the entire attorneys’ fees that Zapata had incurred during the litigation.</p>
<p id="03a4813c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Article 74 of the Convention provides that “damages for breach of contract by one party consist of a sum equal to the loss, including loss of profit, suffered by the other party as a consequence of the breach,” provided the consequence was foreseeable at the time the contract was made. Article 7(2) provides that “questions concerning matters governed by this Convention which are not expressly settled in it are to be settled in conformity with the general principles on which it is based or, in the absence of such principles, in conformity with the law applicable by virtue of the rules of private international law [i.e., conflicts of law rules].” There is no suggestion in the background of the Convention or the cases under it that “loss” was intended to include attorneys’ fees, but no <span title="950" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-950">p. 950</span>suggestion to the contrary either. Nevertheless it seems apparent that “loss” does not include attorneys’ fees incurred in the litigation of a suit for breach of contract, though certain prelitigation legal expenditures, for example expenditures designed to mitigate the plaintiff’s damages, would probably be covered as “incidental” damages. Sorenson v. Fio Rito, 90 Ill. App. 3d 368, 45 Ill. Dec. 714, 413 N.E.2d 47, 50-52 (1980); cf. Tull v. Gundersons, Inc., 709 P.2d 940, 946 (Colo. 1985); Restatement (Second) of Contracts §347, comment <i>c</i> (1981).</p>
<p id="03a4813d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Convention is about contracts, not about procedure. The principles for determining when a losing party must reimburse the winner for the latter’s expense of litigation are usually not a part of a substantive body of law, such as contract law, but a part of procedural law. For example, the “American rule,” that the winner must bear his own litigation expenses, and the “English rule” (followed in most other countries as well), that he is entitled to reimbursement, are rules of general applicability. They are not field-specific. There are, it is true, numerous exceptions to the principle that provisions regarding attorneys’ fees are part of general procedure law. For example, federal antidiscrimination, antitrust, copyright, pension, and securities laws all contain field-specific provisions modifying the American rule (as do many other field-specific statutes). An international convention on contract law <i>could</i> do the same. But not only is the question of attorneys’ fees not “expressly settled” in the Convention, it is not even mentioned. And there are no “principles” that can be drawn out of the provisions of the Convention for determining whether “loss” includes attorneys’ fees; so by the terms of the Convention itself the matter must be left to domestic law (i.e., the law picked out by “the rules of private international law,” which means the rules governing choice of law in international legal disputes).</p>
<p id="03a4813e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">U.S. contract law is different from, say, French contract law, and the general U.S. rule on attorneys’ fee shifting (the “American rule”) is different from the French rule (loser pays). But no one would say that French contract law differs from U.S. <i>because</i> the winner of a contract suit in France is entitled to be reimbursed by the loser, and in the U.S. not. That’s an important difference but not a contract-law difference. It is a difference resulting from differing procedural rules of general applicability.</p>
<p id="03a4813f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The interpretation of “loss” for which Zapata contends would produce anomalies; this is another reason to reject the interpretation. On Zapata’s view the prevailing plaintiff in a suit under the Convention would (though presumably subject to the general contract duty to mitigate damages, to which we referred earlier) get his attorneys’ fees reimbursed more or less automatically (the reason for the “more or less” qualification will become evident in a moment). But what if the defendant won? Could he invoke the domestic law, if as is likely other than in the United States that law entitled either side that wins to reimbursement of his fees by the loser? Well, if so, could a winning plaintiff waive his right to attorneys’ fees under the Convention in favor of domestic law, which might be more or less generous than Article 74, since Article 74 requires that any loss must, to be recoverable, be foreseeable, which beyond some level attorneys’ fees, though reasonable ex post, might not be? And how likely is it that the United States would have signed the Convention had <span title="951" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-951">p. 951</span>it thought that in doing so it was abandoning the hallowed American rule? To the vast majority of the signatories of the Convention, being nations in which loser pays is the rule anyway, the question whether “loss” includes attorneys’ fees would have held little interest; there is no reason to suppose they thought about the question at all.</p>
<p id="03a48140-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For these reasons, we conclude that “loss” in Article 74 does not include attorneys’ fees, and we move on to the question of a district court’s inherent authority to punish a litigant or the litigant’s lawyers for litigating in bad faith. The district judge made clear that he was basing his award of attorneys’ fees to Zapata in part on his indignation at Lenell’s having failed to pay money conceded to be owed to Zapata. Although the precise amount was in dispute, Lenell concedes that it owed Zapata at least half of the $1.2 million that Zapata obtained in damages (not counting the attorneys’ fees) and prejudgment interest. Lenell had no excuse for not paying that amount, and this upset the judge.</p>
<p id="03a48141-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Firms should pay their debts when they have no legal defense to them. <i>Pacta sunt servanda</i>, as the saying goes (“contracts are to be obeyed”). In the civil law (that is, the legal regime of Continental Europe), this principle is taken very seriously, as illustrated by the fact that the civil law grants specific performance in breach of contract cases as a matter of course. But under the common law (including the common law of Illinois, which is the law that choice of law principles make applicable to any issues in this case not covered in express terms by the Convention), a breach of contract is not considered wrongful activity in the sense that a tort or a crime is wrongful. When we delve for reasons, we encounter Holmes’s argument that practically speaking the duty created by a contract is just to perform or pay damages, for only if damages are inadequate relief in the particular circumstances of the case will specific performance be ordered. In other words, and subject to the qualification just mentioned, the entire practical effect of signing a contract is that by doing so one obtains an option to break it. The damages one must pay for breaking the contract are simply the price if the option is exercised. See Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., The Common Law 300-302 (1881); Holmes, “The Path of the Law,” 10 Harv. L. Rev. 457, 462 (1897).</p>
<p id="03a48142-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why such lenity? Perhaps because breach of contract is a form of strict liability. Many breaches are involuntary and so inapt occasions for punishment. Even deliberate breaches are not necessarily culpable, as they may enable an improvement in efficiency — suppose Lenell had a contract to take a certain quantity of tins from Zapata and found that it could buy them for half the price from someone else. Some breaches of contract, it is true, are not only deliberate but culpable, and maybe this was one — Lenell offers no excuse for failing to pay for tins that it had taken delivery of and presumably resold with its cookies in them. Refusing to pay the contract price after the other party has performed is not the kind of option that the performing party would willingly have granted when the contract was negotiated. The option of which Holmes spoke was the option not to perform because performance was impossible or because some more valuable use of the resources required for performance arose after the contract was signed. Zapata argues, moreover, perhaps <span title="952" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-952">p. 952</span>correctly (we need not decide), that Lenell refused to pay in an effort to extract a favorable modification of the terms of the parties’ dealings, which would be a form of duress if Zapata somehow lacked an effective legal remedy. Professional Service Network, Inc. v. American Alliance Holding Co., 238 F.3d 897, 900-901 (7th Cir. 2001); Alaska Packers’ Ass’n v. Domenico, 117 F. 99, 100-104 (9th Cir. 1902). But Zapata did not charge duress, and probably couldn’t, since it had a good remedy — this suit.</p>
<p id="03a48143-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is true that nowadays common law courts will sometimes award punitive damages for breach of contract in bad faith. But outside the field of insurance, where refusals in bad faith to indemnify or defend have long been punishable by awards of punitive damages to the insured, the plaintiff must show that the breach of contract involved tortious misconduct, such as duress or fraud or abuse of fiduciary duty. See, e.g., Miller Brewing Co. v. Best Beers of Bloomington, Inc., 608 N.E.2d 975, 982-983 (Ind. 1993); Story v. City of Bozeman, 242 Mont. 436, 791 P.2d 767, 776 (1990); E. Allan Farnsworth, Contracts §12.8, pp. 788-789 (3d ed. 1999). This is the rule in Illinois, Morrow v. L.A. Goldschmidt Associates, Inc., 112 Ill. 2d 87, 96 Ill. Dec. 939, 492 N.E.2d 181, 183-186 (1986), and Zapata has not tried to come within it. For that matter, it did not ask for punitive damages, and the judge had no authority to award attorneys’ fees in lieu of such damages. He could not have awarded punitive damages if Zapata had asked for them but had been unable to prove tortious misconduct by Lenell, and even more clearly he could not award them when they had not been requested.</p>
<p id="03a48144-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The decision whether punitive damages shall be a sanction for a breach of contract is an issue of substantive law, and under the <i>Erie</i> doctrine a federal court is not authorized to apply a different substantive law of contracts in a diversity case from the law that a state court would apply were the case being litigated in a state court instead. And obviously that rule must not be circumvented by renaming punitive damages “attorneys’ fees.” United States ex rel. Treat Bros. Co. v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. of Maryland, 986 F.2d 1110, 1119-1120 (7th Cir. 1993); see also Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 52-55 (1991). . . . It is true that this is not a diversity case, but the <i>Erie</i> doctrine applies to any case in which state law supplies the rule of decision, see, e.g., O’Melveny &amp; Myers v. FDIC, 512 U.S. 79, 83-85, 87-88 (1994), here by incorporation in the Convention.</p>
<p id="03a48145-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The inherent authority of federal courts to punish misconduct before them is not a grant of authority to do good, rectify shortcomings of the common law (as by using an award of attorneys’ fees to make up for an absence that the judge may deem regrettable of punitive damages for certain breaches of contract), or undermine the American rule on the award of attorneys’ fees to the prevailing party in the absence of statute. Morganroth &amp; Morganroth v. DeLorean, 213 F.3d 1301, 1318 (10th Cir. 2000); Association of Flight Attendants, AFL-CIO v. Horizon Air Industries, Inc., supra, 976 F.2d at 548-550 (9th Cir. 1992); Shimman v. International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 18, 744 F.2d 1226, 1232-1233 and n.9 (6th Cir. 1984) (en banc). These cases and others we could cite make clear that it is a residual authority, to be <span title="953" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-953">p. 953</span>exercised sparingly, to punish misconduct (1) occurring in the litigation itself, not in the events giving rise to the litigation (for then the punishment would be a product of substantive law — designed, for example, to deter breaches of contract), and (2) not adequately dealt with by other rules, most pertinently here Rules 11 and 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which Lenell has not been accused of violating.</p>
<p id="03a48146-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Insofar as he focused on Lenell’s behavior in the litigation itself, which, to repeat, is the only lawful domain of the relevant concept of “inherent authority” — the authority could not constitutionally be extended to give parties remedies not available to them under the law of the state that furnishes the substantive rules of decision in the case — the judge punished Lenell for having failed to acknowledge liability and spare Zapata and the judge and the jury and the witnesses and so on the burden of a trial. But as it happens, the fault here was in no small measure the judge’s. Well before the trial, and long, long before Zapata’s lawyers had run the tab up to $550,000, they had moved for partial summary judgment, claiming that Lenell in answer to Zapata’s requests for admission had acknowledged liability for $858,000 of the $890,000 sought in the complaint. The judge had denied the motion on the ground that partial summary judgment cannot be granted unless the grant would give rise to an appealable judgment. This was error. [The court then discusses how Rule 56 allows for partial summary judgment whether the judgment is appealable or not. — <span class="epub-small-caps">Eds</span>.]</p>
<p id="03a48147-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since the challenged award of $550,000 in attorneys’ fees cannot stand, we need not pick through the record to see whether some of the counterclaims or other moves by Lenell during the trial were sanctionable apart from Rule 11 and Rule 37. But it may be useful in guiding further proceedings on remand to point out that to the extent that those rules place limits on the award of sanctions under them (for example by the provision of safe harbors in Rule 11), those limitations are equally limitations on inherent authority, which may not be used to amend the rules. Kovilic Construction Co. v. Missbrenner, 106 F.3d 768, 772-773 (7th Cir. 1997). For federal rules of procedure have the force of statutes. See id.; 28 U.S.C. §2072(b).</p>
<p id="03a4a758-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One issue remains for discussion. Although we have treated the appeal so far as if the only issues concerned attorneys’ fees, Lenell also argues that the jury verdict should be set aside because the judge by his comments in open court signaled to the jury his scorn for Lenell’s case. There were only a couple of such comments (many more, however, at sidebars outside the jury’s hearing), and we do not think they could have changed the outcome. But we also think that judges should be very cautious about making comments in the hearing of a jury about the quality of a party’s case or lawyers. For if he signals to the jury his opinion as to how the case should be decided, he undermines the jury’s authority. . . . </p>

<li class=""><p id="03a4a75d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>CISG as grounds for recovery of attorney fees</i>. As stated by the <i>Zapata</i> court, the “English (or British)” rule concerning attorney fees is that the loser in litigation pays those fees for the prevailing party. This “fee-shifting” approach is also found in most civil law countries. In contrast, the “American rule” dictates that parties pay their own attorney fees. As detailed below, there are exceptions to the American rule that allow the awarding of attorney fees to the prevailing party when the parties have a valid contract term allowing for attorney fees, when there is an applicable statute granting such fees, or when there is an established court rule that allows for recovery. The primary issue facing the court in <i>Zapata</i> was whether the Convention for the International Sale of Goods (CISG), as a treaty that is tantamount to federal legislation, should be interpreted to provide for recovery of attorney fees.</p>
<p id="03a4a75e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The CISG applied in <i>Zapata</i>, of course, because the plaintiff had its place of business in Mexico, the defendant had its place of business in the United States, and both countries are signatories to the CISG. (Most of the United States’ major trading partners, with the exception of the United Kingdom, are parties to the CISG. See the Rules of Contract Law supplement, Editors’ Note on Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.) The trial court in <i>Zapata</i> held that attorney fees are recoverable under CISG Article 74 if they are foreseeable, and the defendant in <i>Zapata</i> stipulated that attorney fees were a foreseeable result of its failure to pay for the tins that it ordered. Perhaps more importantly, the trial court based its decision on the considerations that the “American rule” on attorney fees is a minority rule in the world community and, as reflected in its Preamble and Article 7, the CISG has a goal of promoting uniformity and certainty in the law. See Zapata Hermanos Sucesores, S.A. v. Hearthside Baking Company, Inc., 2001 WL 1000927 (N.D. Ill.). Thus, one could argue that the trial court’s decision to allow attorney fees was consistent with central tenets of the CISG.</p>
<p id="03a4a75f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court’s grant of attorney fees, with Judge Posner’s opinion fitting nicely into a syllogism: The CISG deals with the substantive law of contracts, not procedure; attorney fees are a matter of procedure, not substance; therefore, the CISG does not authorize the recovery of attorney fees. It is unclear whether the decision in <i>Zapata</i> will be followed by other courts. Compare Stemcor United States v. Miracero, S.A. de C.V., 66 F. Supp. 3d 394 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (citing scholarly criticism and contrary decisions and upholding an arbitration decision to award attorney fees under Article 74) with Victory Foodservice Distribs. Corp. v. N. Chr. <span title="955" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-955">p. 955</span>Laitsos &amp; Co. Ltd., 2017 U.S. Dist.

<li class=""><p id="03a4a760-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Statutory exceptions for attorney fees, including the UCC</i>. As noted above, attorney fees may be awarded when a statute specifically provides for such recovery. Numerous federal and state statutes, covering the entire range of economic activity — consumer protection, civil rights, environmental protection, employment law, and securities regulation, to name just a few — authorize courts to grant attorney fees. See generally John F. Vargo, The American Rule on Attorney Fee Allocation: The Injured Person’s Access to Justice, 42 Am. U. L. Rev. 1567, 1587-1588 (1993) (noting there are more than 200 federal statutes and almost 2,000 state statutes providing for attorney fees).</p>
<p id="03a4a761-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While the transaction in <i>Zapata</i> came under the CISG, a sale of goods between two American companies would be governed by the UCC. It has been occasionally contended that the UCC Article 2 provides for, or at least permits, the award of attorney fees to a victorious plaintiff, either as incidental or consequential damages. UCC §§2-710, 2-715. Such claims have almost always been unsuccessful. Indiana Glass Co. v. Indiana Mich. Power Co., 692 N.E.2d 886, 888 (Ind. Ct. App 1998) (“overwhelming weight of authority from other jurisdictions indicating that attorney’s fees are not recoverable under §2-715”). In contrast, UCC §2A-108(4) explicitly authorizes the award of attorney fees for unconscionable terms or conduct in inducing or enforcing consumer leases only.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03a4a762-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Court rules as basis for attorney fees</i>. In addition to the statutory provisions discussed in the previous note, court rules may also allow the recovery of attorney fees. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which constitute the model for most state procedural systems, contain a number of provisions allowing courts to award attorney fees against an attorney or party who engages in improper litigation conduct. Probably the best known of these is Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 11 provides, essentially, that by presenting a pleading, written motion, or paper to a court, an attorney or unrepresented party is certifying “to the best of the person’s knowledge, information, and belief formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances” that the litigation is not being presented for any improper purpose, that the claims and legal contentions are not frivolous and supported by the available evidence, and that any denials of factual contentions are warranted. Similar to Rule 11, a federal statute, 28 U.S.C. §1927, provides for sanctions against an attorney who “multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously.” As an alternative basis for awarding attorney fees, the trial court in <i>Zapata</i> relied on 28 U.S.C. §1927 and Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32 (1991), a Supreme Court decision that established that federal courts have inherent power to impose sanctions for bad faith conduct in specific situations. State courts have reached a similar conclusion. See, e.g., Maris v. McGrath, 850 A.2d 133 (Conn. 2004) (state courts have inherent authority to impose attorney fees as sanction for dilatory, bad faith, and harassing litigation even in absence of violation of a specific rule or order).</p>

The Seventh Circuit concluded that a federal court’s inherent authority to award fees is limited to conduct occurring during the course of the litigation and not covered by other rules of procedure or statutes. See also Centex v. U.S., 486 F.3d 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (aligning with eight other circuits holding that attorney fees cannot be awarded based solely on pre-litigation conduct); but see Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32 (1991) (5-4 decision affirming award of sanctions for litigation abuse, including fraud, even when conduct occurred outside the courtroom and holding that federal courts have inherent authority to award sanctions).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03a4a764-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Contract terms as basis for attorney fees.</i> Since a principal policy of contract law is to enforce the reasonable expectations created by the contract, it would appear that where the contract at issue expressly provides for an award of attorney fees to the prevailing party in a dispute, the court should enforce that promise so long as the fees are reasonable. See McMullen v. Kutz, 985 A.2d 769 (Pa. 2009). In a notable combination of the statutory and contract exceptions, California has enacted legislation which provides that if a contract grants attorney fees to one party, the agreement will be applied to also allow attorney fees for the other party if it should prevail in litigation. See Cal. Civ. Code §1717(a).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03a4a765-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Attorney fees available in other situations.</i> While contract provision, statutory mandate, and court rule constitute the three major exceptions to the American rule, some courts have recognized other exceptions. When the defendant’s breach of contract causes the plaintiff to engage in “collateral litigation,” the plaintiff may recover as consequential damage for breach of the principal contract the attorney fees incurred in the collateral litigation. The American rule only bars recovery of the litigation expenses in the case against the defendant. See, e.g., Eastern Shore Title Co. v. Ochse, 160 A.3d 1238 (Md. 2017) (recognizing the “collateral litigation” exception to the American Rule). Can you offer any justification for this distinction?</p>
<p id="03a4ce76-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In some states courts have allowed an insured who incurs attorney fees in forcing an insurance company to honor its contractual obligations to recover these expenses. These courts usually rely on the special relationship that exists between insurer and insured. See Preferred Mutual Insurance Co. v. Gamache, 686 N.E.2d 989 (Mass. 1997) (attorney fees incurred by insured in obtaining declaratory judgment that insured had coverage under homeowners policy were recoverable).</p></li>

A jury awarded the homeowners the full cost necessary to repair their home as well as damages for emotional distress caused by the contractor’s negligent performance. Since the contractor’s negligence directly caused only economic injury and property damage, and breached no duty independent of the contract, we conclude the homeowners may not recover damages for emotional distress based upon breach of a contract to build a house.<span title="958" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-958">p. 958</span></p>

<p id="03a4ce83-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both parties agree with the facts as ascertained by the Court of Appeal. Barry and Sandra Erlich contracted with John Menezes, a licensed general contractor, to build a “dreamhouse” on their ocean-view lot. The Erlichs moved into their house in December 1990. In February 1991, the rains came. “[T]he house leaked from every conceivable location. Walls were saturated in[an upstairs bedroom], two bedrooms downstairs, and the pool room. Nearly every window in the house leaked. The living room filled with three inches of standing water. In several locations water ‘poured in[] streams’ from the ceilings and walls. The ceiling in the garage became so saturated . . . the plaster liquefied and fell in chunks to the floor.”</p>
<p id="03a4f594-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Menezes’s attempts to stop the leaks proved ineffectual. Caulking placed around the windows melted, “ ‘ran down [the] windows and stained them and ran across the driveway and ran down the house [until it] . . . looked like someone threw balloons with paint in them at the house.’ ” Despite several repair efforts, which included using sledgehammers and jackhammers to cut holes in the exterior walls and ceilings, application of new waterproofing materials on portions of the roof and exterior walls, and more caulk, the house continued to leak — from the windows, from the roofs, and water seeped between the floors. Fluorescent light fixtures in the garage filled with water and had to be removed.</p>
<p id="03a4f595-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“The Erlichs eventually had their home inspected by another general contractor and a structural engineer. In addition to confirming defects in the roof, exterior stucco, windows and waterproofing, the inspection revealed serious errors in the construction of the home’s structural components. None of the 20 shear, or load-bearing walls specified in the plans were properly installed. The three turrets on the roof were inadequately connected to the roof beams and, as a result, had begun to collapse. Other connections in the roof framing were also improperly constructed. Three decks were in danger of ‘catastrophic collapse’ because they had been finished with mortar and ceramic tile, rather than with the light-weight roofing material originally specified. Finally, the foundation of the main beam for the two-story living room was poured by digging a shallow hole, dumping in ‘two sacks of dry concrete mix, putting some water in the hole and mixing it up with a shovel.’ ” This foundation, required to carry a load of 12,000 pounds, could only support about 2,000. The beam is settling and the surrounding concrete is cracking.</p>
<p id="03a4f596-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to the Erlichs’ expert, problems were major and pervasive, concerning everything “related to a window or waterproofing, everywhere that there was something related to framing,” stucco, or the walking deck.</p>
<p id="03a4f597-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both of the Erlichs testified that they suffered emotional distress as a result of the defective condition of the house and Menezes’s invasive and unsuccessful repair attempts. Barry Erlich testified he felt “absolutely sick” and had to be “carted away in an ambulance” when he learned the full extent of the structural problems. He has a permanent heart condition, known as superventricular tachyarrhythmia, attributable, in part, to excessive stress. Although the condition <span title="959" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-959">p. 959</span>can be controlled with medication, it has forced him to resign his positions as athletic director, department head and track coach.</p>
<p id="03a4f598-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sandra Erlich feared the house would collapse in an earthquake and feared for her daughter’s safety. Stickers were placed on her bedroom windows, and alarms and emergency lights installed so rescue crews would find her room first in an emergency.</p>
<p id="03a4f599-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs sought recovery on several theories, including breach of contract, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and negligent construction. Both the breach of contract claim and the negligence claim alleged numerous construction defects.</p>
<p id="03a4f59a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Menezes prevailed on the fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims. The jury found he breached his contract with the Erlichs by negligently constructing their home and awarded $406,700 as the cost of repairs. Each spouse was awarded $50,000 for emotional distress, and Barry Erlich received an additional $50,000 for physical pain and suffering and $15,000 for lost earnings.</p>
<p id="03a4f59b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By a two-to-one majority, the Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment, including the emotional distress award. The majority noted the breach of a contractual duty may support an action in tort. The jury found Menezes was negligent. Since his negligence exposed the Erlichs to “intolerable living conditions and a constant, justifiable fear about the safety of their home,” the majority decided the Erlichs were properly compensated for their emotional distress.</p>
<p id="03a4f59c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The dissent pointed out that no reported California case has upheld an award of emotional distress damages based upon simple breach of a contract to build a house. Since Menezes’s negligence directly caused only economic injury and property damage, the Erlichs were not entitled to recover damages for their emotional distress.</p>

<p id="03a4f59f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A. In an action for breach of contract, the measure of damages is “the amount which will compensate the party aggrieved for all the detriment proximately caused thereby, or which, in the ordinary course of things, would be likely to result therefrom” (Civ. Code, §3300), provided the damages are “clearly ascertainable in both their nature and origin” (Civ. Code, §3301). In an action not arising from contract, the measure of damages is “the amount which will compensate for all the detriment proximately caused thereby, whether it could have been anticipated or not” (Civ. Code, §3333).</p>
<p id="03a4f5a0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Contract damages are generally limited to those within the contemplation of the parties when the contract was entered into or at least reasonably foreseeable by them at that time; consequential damages beyond the expectation of the parties are not recoverable. [Citations.] This limitation on available damages serves to encourage contractual relations and commercial activity by enabling parties to estimate in advance the financial risks of their enterprise.” (Applied Equipment Corp. v. Litton Saudi Arabia Ltd. (1994) 7 Cal. 4th 503, 515, 28 Cal. Rptr. 2d 475, 869 P.2d 454 <i>(Applied Equipment)</i>.) “In contrast, tort damages are awarded to [fully] compensate <span title="960" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-960">p. 960</span>the victim for [all] injury suffered. [Citation.]” (Id. at p. 516, 28 Cal. Rptr. 2d 475, 869 P.2d 454.)</p>
<p id="03a4f5a1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“ ‘[T]he distinction between tort and contract is well grounded in common law, and divergent objectives underlie the remedies created in the two areas. Whereas contract actions are created to enforce the intentions of the parties to the agreement, tort law is primarily designed to vindicate “social policy.” [Citation.]’ ” (Hunter v. Up-Right, Inc. (1993) 6 Cal. 4th 1174, 1180, 26 Cal. Rptr. 2d 8, 864 P.2d 88, quoting Foley v. Interactive Data Corp. (1988) 47 Cal. 3d 654, 683, 254 Cal. Rptr. 211, 765 P.2d 373 (<i>Foley</i>).) While the purposes behind contract and tort law are distinct, the boundary line between them is not (Freeman &amp; Mills, Inc. v. Belcher Oil Co. (1995) 11 Cal. 4th 85, 106, 44 Cal. Rptr. 2d 420, 900 P.2d 669 (conc. and dis. opn. of Mosk, J.) (<i>Freeman &amp; Mills</i>)) and the distinction between the remedies for each is not “ ‘found ready made.’ ” (Ibid., quoting Holmes, The Common Law (1881) p.13.) These uncertain boundaries and the apparent breadth of the recovery available for tort actions create pressure to obliterate the distinction between contracts and torts — an expansion of tort law at the expense of contract principles which Grant Gilmore aptly dubbed “con<i>torts.</i>” In this case we consider whether a negligent breach of a contract will support an award of damages for emotional distress — either as tort damages for negligence or as consequential or special contract damages.</p>
<p id="03a4f5a2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">B. In concluding emotional distress damages were properly awarded, the Court of Appeal correctly observed that “the same wrongful act may constitute both a breach of contract and an invasion of an interest protected by the law of torts.” . . . Here, the court permitted plaintiffs to recover both full repair costs as normal contract damages and emotional distress damages as a tort remedy.</p>
<p id="03a4f5a3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeal also noted that “[a] contractual obligation may create a legal duty and the breach of that duty may support an action in tort.” This is true; however, conduct amounting to a breach of contract becomes tortious only when it also violates a duty independent of the contract arising from principles of tort law. (<i>Applied Equipment,</i> supra, 7 Cal. 4th at p. 515, 28 Cal. Rptr. 2d 475, 869 P.2d 454.) “ ‘ “An omission to perform a contract obligation is never a tort, unless that omission is also an omission of a legal duty.” ’ ” (Ibid., quoting Jones v. Kelly (1929) 208 Cal. 251, 255, 280 P. 942.)</p>
<p id="03a4f5a4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Tort damages have been permitted in contract cases where a breach of duty directly causes physical injury . . . ; for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in insurance contracts . . . ; for wrongful discharge in violation of fundamental public policy . . . ; or where the contract was fraudulently induced. . . . In each of these cases, the duty that gives rise to tort liability is either completely independent of the contract or arises from conduct which is both intentional and intended to harm. . . . </p>
<p id="03a51cb5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff’s theory of tort recovery is that mental distress is a foreseeable consequence of negligent breaches of standard commercial contracts. However, foreseeability alone is not sufficient to create an independent tort duty. “ ‘Whether a defendant owes a duty of care is a question of law. Its existence depends upon the foreseeability of the risk and a weighing of policy considerations for and <span title="961" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-961">p. 961</span>against imposition of liability.’[Citation.]” (Burgess v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal. 4th 1064, 1072, 9 Cal. Rptr. 2d 615, 831 P.2d 1197.) Because the consequences of a negligent act must be limited to avoid an intolerable burden on society . . . , the determination of duty “recognizes that policy considerations may dictate a cause of action should not be sanctioned no matter how foreseeable the risk.” . . . “[T]here are clear judicial days on which a court can foresee forever and thus determine liability but none on which that foresight alone provides a socially and judicially acceptable limit on recovery of damages for [an] injury.” (Thing v. La Chusa (1989) 48 Cal. 3d 644, 668, 257 Cal. Rptr. 865, 771 P.2d 814.) In short, foreseeability is not synonymous with duty; nor is it a substitute.</p>
<p id="03a51cb6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question thus remains: is the mere negligent breach of a contract sufficient? The answer is no. It may admittedly be difficult to categorize the cases, but to state the rule succinctly: “[C]ourts will generally enforce the breach of a contractual promise through contract law, except when the actions that constitute the breach violate a social policy that merits the imposition of tort remedies.” (<i>Freeman &amp; Mills,</i> supra, 11 Cal. 4th at p. 107, 44 Cal. Rptr. 2d 420, 900 P.2d 669 (conc. and dis. opn. of Mosk, J.).) The familiar paradigm of tortious breach of contract in this state is the insurance contract. There we relied on the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, implied in every contract, to justify tort liability. . . . In holding that a tort action is available for breach of the covenant in an insurance contract, we have “emphasized the ‘special relationship’ between insurer and insured, characterized by elements of public interest, adhesion, and fiduciary responsibility.” (<i>Freeman &amp; Mills,</i> supra, 11 Cal. 4th at p. 91, 44 Cal. Rptr. 2d 420, 900 P.2d 669. . . .)</p>
<p id="03a51cb7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The special relationship test, which has been criticized as illusory and not sufficiently precise . . . has little relevance to the question before us. Menezes is in the business of building single-family homes. He is one among thousands of contractors who provide the same service, and the Erlichs could take their choice among any contractors willing to accept work in the area where their home would be constructed. Although they undoubtedly relied on his claimed expertise, they were in a position to view, inspect, and criticize his work, or to hire someone who could. Most significantly, there is no indication Menezes sought to frustrate the Erlichs’ enjoyment of contracted-for benefits. He did build a house. His ineptitude led to numerous problems which he attempted to correct. And he remains ultimately responsible for reimbursing the cost of doing the job properly.</p>
<p id="03a51cb8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, since, as <i>Foley</i> noted, the insurance cases represented “a major departure from traditional principles of contract law,” any claim for automatic extension of that exceptional approach whenever “certain hallmarks and similarities can be adduced in another contract setting” should be carefully considered. (<i>Foley,</i> supra, 47 Cal. 3d at p. 690, 254 Cal. Rptr. 211, 765 P.2d 373.)</p>
<p id="03a51cb9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our previous decisions detail the reasons for denying tort recovery in contract breach cases: the different objectives underlying tort and contract breach; the importance of predictability in assuring commercial stability in contractual <span title="962" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-962">p. 962</span>dealings; the potential for converting every contract breach into a tort, with accompanying punitive damage recovery, and the preference for legislative action in affording appropriate remedies. . . . The same concerns support a cautious approach here. Restrictions on contract remedies serve to protect the “ ‘freedom to bargain over special risks and [to] promote contract formation by limiting liability to the value of the promise.’ ” . . . </p>
<p id="03a51cba-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Generally, outside the insurance context, “a tortious breach of contract . . . may be found when (1) the breach is accompanied by a traditional common law tort, such as fraud or conversion; (2) the means used to breach the contract are tortious, involving deceit or undue coercion or; (3) one party intentionally breaches the contract intending or knowing that such a breach will cause severe, unmitigable harm in the form of mental anguish, personal hardship, or substantial consequential damages.” (<i>Freeman &amp; Mills,</i> supra, 11 Cal. 4th at p. 105, 44 Cal. Rptr. 2d 420, 900 P.2d 669 (conc. and dis. opn. of Mosk, J.).) Focusing on intentional conduct gives substance to the proposition that a breach of contract is tortious only when some independent duty arising from tort law is violated. . . . If every negligent breach of a contract gives rise to tort damages the limitation would be meaningless, as would the statutory distinction between tort and contract remedies.</p>
<p id="03a51cbb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, the jury concluded Menezes did not act intentionally; nor was he guilty of fraud or misrepresentation. This is a claim for negligent breach of a contract, which is not sufficient to support tortious damages for violation of an independent tort duty.</p>
<p id="03a51cbc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It may ultimately be more useful, in attempting to develop a common law of tortious breach, to affirmatively identify specific practices utilized by contracting parties that merit the imposition of tort remedies (<i>Freeman &amp; Mills,</i> supra, 11 Cal. 4th at p. 107, 44 Cal. Rptr. 2d 420, 900 P.2d 669 (conc. and dis. opn. of Mosk, J.)) instead of comparing each new claim to a template for exceptions. In the interim, however, it is sufficient to note that more than mere negligence has been involved in each case where tort damages have been permitted. The benefits of broad compensation must be balanced against the burdens on commercial stability. “[C]ourts should be careful to apply tort remedies only when the conduct in question is so clear in its deviation from socially useful business practices that the effect of enforcing such tort duties will be . . . to aid rather than discourage commerce.” (<i>Freeman &amp; Mills,</i> supra, 11 Cal. 4th at p. 109, 44 Cal. Rptr. 2d 420, 900 P.2d 669 (conc. and dis. opn. of Mosk, J.).)</p>
<p id="03a51cbd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">C. Even assuming Menezes’s negligence constituted a sufficient independent duty to the Erlichs, such a finding would not entitle them to emotional distress damages on these facts. “The fact that emotional distress damages may be awarded in some circumstances (see Rest. 2d Torts, §905, pp. 456-457) does not mean they are available in every case in which there is an independent cause of action founded upon negligence.” (Merenda v. Superior Court (1992) 3 Cal. App. 4th 1, 7, 4 Cal. Rptr. 2d 87 (<i>Merenda</i>).) “No California case has allowed recovery for emotional distress arising solely out of property damage” (Cooper v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal. App. 3d 1008, 1012, 200 Cal. Rptr. 746); moreover, a preexisting contractual relationship, without more, will not <span title="963" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-963">p. 963</span>support a recovery for mental suffering where the defendant’s tortious conduct has resulted only in economic injury to the plaintiff. . . . </p>

Rptr. 2d 24, two artists lost a substantial portion of their life’s work when a city trash truck, which had been parked on a hilltop, rolled down and crashed into their home, damaging the house, two cars, and much of their artwork. The Lubners filed a negligence action and sought damages for their emotional distress. Recognizing that the artwork may have been extremely important to the Lubners, the court nevertheless found they were not entitled to recover for emotional distress caused by injury to property. (Id. at p. 532, 53 Cal. Rptr. 2d 24.) The court based its ruling primarily on the absence of a preexisting relationship between the parties, but separately considered whether the defendant breached a duty of care to the plaintiffs. Noting that the moral blame on the defendant was only that which attends ordinary negligence and nothing in the record indicated bad faith or reckless indifference to the Lubners’ emotional tranquillity, the court concluded liability for negligent infliction of emotional distress was unwarranted. (Id. at p. 534, 53 Cal. Rptr. 2d 24.)</p>
<p id="03a51cc0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Public policy supports a similar limit where the negligence concerns the construction of a home. In Blagrove v. J.B. Mechanical, Inc. (Wyo. 1997) 934 P.2d 1273 (<i>Blagrove</i>), the homeowners sued a plumbing contractor to recover damages for mental anguish caused when flooding from a faulty plumbing connection damaged their home and destroyed personal possessions. The Wyoming Supreme Court held that, absent physical injury, emotional distress damages can be recovered only in limited circumstances involving intentional torts, constitutional violations, and the breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in insurance contracts, and concluded a contrary rule would be poor public policy.</p>

<p id="03a51cc2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, the breach — the negligent construction of the Erlichs’ house — did not cause physical injury. No one was hit by a falling beam. Although the Erlichs state they feared the house was structurally unsafe and might collapse in an earthquake, they lived in it for five years. The only physical injury alleged is Barry Erlich’s heart disease, which flowed from the emotional distress and not directly from the negligent construction.</p>
<p id="03a51cc3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Erlichs may have hoped to build their dream home and live happily ever after, but there is a reason that tag line belongs only in fairy tales. Building a house may turn out to be a stress-free project; it is much more likely to be the stuff of urban legends — the cause of bankruptcy, marital dissolution, hypertension and fleeting fantasies ranging from homicide to suicide. As Justice Yegan noted below, “No reasonable homeowner can embark on a building project <span title="964" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-964">p. 964</span>with certainty that the project will be completed to perfection. Indeed, errors are so likely to occur that few if any homeowners would be justified in resting their peace of mind on [its] timely or correct completion. . . .” The connection between the service sought and the aggravation and distress resulting from incompetence may be somewhat less tenuous than in a malpractice case, but the emotional suffering still derives from an inherently economic concern.</p>
<p id="03a543d4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">D. Having concluded tort damages are not available, we finally consider whether damages for emotional distress should be included as consequential or special damages in a contract claim. “Contract damages are generally limited to those within the contemplation of the parties when the contract was entered into or at least reasonably foreseeable by them at the time; consequential damages beyond the expectations of the parties are not recoverable. [Citations.] This limitation on available damages serves to encourage contractual relations and commercial activity by enabling parties to estimate in advance the financial risks of their enterprise.” (<i>Applied Equipment,</i> supra, 7 Cal. 4th at p. 515, 28 Cal. Rptr. 2d 475, 869 P.2d 454.)</p>
<p id="03a543d5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“ ‘[W]hen two parties make a contract, they agree upon the rules and regulations which will govern their relationship; the risks inherent in the agreement and the likelihood of its breach. The parties to the contract in essence create a mini-universe for themselves, in which each voluntarily chooses his contracting partner, each trusts the other’s willingness to keep his word and honor his commitments, and in which they define their respective obligations, rewards and risks. Under such a scenario, it is appropriate to enforce only such obligations as each party voluntarily assumed, and to give him only such benefits as he expected to receive; this is the function of contract law.’ ” (<i>Applied Equipment,</i> supra, 7 Cal. 4th at p. 517, 28 Cal. Rptr. 2d 475, 869 P.2d 454.)</p>
<p id="03a543d6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, damages for mental suffering and emotional distress are generally not recoverable in an action for breach of an ordinary commercial contract in California. (Kwan v. Mercedes-Benz of North America, Inc. (1994) 23 Cal. App. 4th 174, 188, 28 Cal. Rptr. 2d 371) (<i>Kwan</i>). . . . “Recovery for emotional disturbance will be excluded unless the breach also caused bodily harm or the contract or the breach is of such a kind that serious emotional disturbance was a particularly likely result.” (Rest. 2d Contracts, §353.) The Restatement specifically notes the breach of a contract to build a home is not “particularly likely” to result in “serious emotional disturbance.” (Ibid.)</p>
<p id="03a543d7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Cases permitting recovery for emotional distress typically involve mental anguish stemming from more personal undertakings the traumatic results of which were unavoidable. (See, e.g., Burgess v. Superior Court, supra, 2 Cal. 4th 1064, 9 Cal. Rptr. 2d 615, 831 P.2d 1197 [infant injured during childbirth]; Molien v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals (1980) 27 Cal. 3d 916, 167 Cal. Rptr. 831, 616 P.2d 813 [misdiagnosed venereal disease and subsequent failure of marriage]; Kately v. Wilkinson (1983) 148 Cal.

Thus, when the express object of the contract is the mental and emotional well-being of one <span title="965" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-965">p. 965</span>of the contracting parties, the breach of the contract may give rise to damages for mental suffering or emotional distress. (See Wynn v. Monterey Club (1980) 111 Cal. App. 3d 789, 799-801, 168 Cal. Rptr. 878 [agreement of two gambling clubs to exclude husband’s gambling-addicted wife from clubs and not to cash her checks]; Ross v. Forest Lawn Memorial Park (1984) 153 Cal.

<p id="03a543d8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Cases from other jurisdictions have formulated a similar rule, barring recovery of emotional distress damages for breach of contract except in cases involving contracts in which emotional concerns are the essence of the contract. (See, e.g., Hancock v. Northcutt (Alaska 1991) 808 P.2d 251, 258 [“contracts pertaining to one’s dwelling are not among those contracts which, if breached, are particularly likely to result in serious emotional disturbance”; typical damages for breach of house construction contracts can appropriately be calculated in terms of monetary loss]. . . . </p>
<p id="03a543d9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs argue strenuously that a broader notion of damages is appropriate when the contract is for the construction of a home. Amici curiae urge us to permit emotional distress damages in cases of negligent construction of a personal residence when the negligent construction causes gross interference with the normal use and habitability of the residence.</p>
<p id="03a543da-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Such a rule would make the financial risks of construction agreements difficult to predict. Contract damages must be clearly ascertainable in both nature and origin. (Civ. Code, §3301.) A contracting party cannot be required to assume limitless responsibility for all consequences of a breach and must be advised of any special harm that might result in order to determine whether or not to accept the risk of contracting. . . . </p>
<p id="03a543db-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, adding an emotional distress component to recovery for construction defects could increase the already prohibitively high cost of housing in California, affect the availability of insurance for builders, and greatly diminish the supply of affordable housing. The potential for such broad-ranging economic consequences — costs likely to be paid by the public generally — means the task of fashioning appropriate limits on the availability of emotional distress claims should be left to the Legislature. (See Tex. Prop. Code Ann. §27.001 et seq. (1999); Hawaii Rev. Stat. §663-8.9 (1998).)</p>
<p id="03a543dc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Permitting damages for emotional distress on the theory that certain contracts carry a lot of emotional freight provides no useful guidance. Courts have carved out a narrow range of exceptions to the general rule of exclusion where emotional tranquillity is the contract’s essence. Refusal to broaden the bases for recovery reflects a fundamental policy choice. A rule which focuses not on the risks contracting parties voluntarily assume but on one party’s reaction to inadequate performance, cannot provide any principled limit on liability.</p>
<p id="03a543dd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The discussion in <i>Kwan,</i> a case dealing with the breach of a sales contract for the purchase of a car, is instructive. “[A] contract for [the] sale of an automobile <span title="966" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-966">p. 966</span>is not essentially tied to the buyer’s mental or emotional well-being. Personal as the choice of a car may be, the central reason for buying one is usually transportation. . . . In spite of America’s much-discussed ‘love affair with the automobile,’ disruption of an owner’s relationship with his or her car is not, in the normal case, comparable to the loss or mistreatment of a family member’s remains [citation], an invasion of one’s privacy [citation], or the loss of one’s spouse to a gambling addiction [citation]. In the latter situations, the contract exists primarily to further or protect emotional interests; the direct and foreseeable injuries resulting from a breach are also primarily emotional. In contrast, the undeniable aggravation, irritation and anxiety that may result from [the] breach of an automobile warranty are secondary effects deriving from the decreased usefulness of the car and the frequently frustrating process of having an automobile repaired. While [the] purchase of an automobile may sometimes lead to severe emotional distress, such a result is not ordinarily foreseeable from the nature of the contract.” (<i>Kwan,</i> supra, 23 Cal. App. 4th at p. 190, 28 Cal. Rptr. 2d 371.)</p>
<p id="03a56aee-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most other jurisdictions have reached the same conclusion. (See . . . City of Tyler v. Likes (Tex. 1997) 962 S.W.2d 489, 497 [mental anguish based solely on property damage is not compensable as a matter of law].)</p>
<p id="03a56aef-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree. The available damages for defective construction are limited to the cost of repairing the home, including lost use or relocation expenses, or the diminution in value. . . . The Erlichs received more than $400,000 in traditional contract damages to correct the defects in their home. While their distress was undoubtedly real and serious, we conclude the balance of policy considerations — the potential for significant increases in liability in amounts disproportionate to culpability, the court’s inability to formulate appropriate limits on the availability of claims, and the magnitude of the impact on stability and predictability in commercial affairs — counsel against expanding contract damages to include mental distress claims in negligent construction cases.</p>

Should the Erlichs have moved out? Consider the following background information:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03a5920d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why didn’t they move out, rather than remaining in perpetual fear for their safety, and if the house was in imminent danger of collapse? The simple reality was that the Erlichs could not afford to mitigate their damages, even though they might properly have recovered the expenses incurred for doing so. (Respondent’s Brief at 14; (R.T. 478-479). It was a practical impossibility for them to achieve real mitigation, because they were effectively trapped in their nightmare home.</p>

<li class=""><p id="03a59210-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Contract cases in which damages for emotional distress may be recovered.</i> In part II(D), the court cites Restatement (Second) §353 as identifying two types of cases in which damages for emotional distress may be recovered in an action for breach of contract. In the first type of case, the breach of contract also causes bodily harm. E.g., Sullivan v. O’Connor, 296 N.E.2d 183 (Mass. 1973) (breach of contract action against surgeon who had promised to enhance appearance of plaintiff’s nose; damages for emotional distress recoverable when operation disfigured nose). In the second category of cases, emotional distress is a “particularly likely” consequence of the breach. Comment <i>a</i> to §353 sets forth certain types of contracts in which the courts have found emotional distress to be particularly likely: contracts of carriers and innkeepers with passengers and guests, contracts dealing with the carriage or disposition of dead bodies, and contracts for the delivery of messages concerning death. The court’s opinion gives several other examples. See also Miranda v. Said, 836 N.W.2d 8 (Iowa 2013) (holding that emotional distress was a particularly likely result of breach of attorney-client contract for immigration services when the breach resulted in separation of family members).</p>
<p id="03a59211-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Outside of these established exceptions, numerous contract cases have denied such recovery even though the breach appears to have caused the plaintiff substantial emotional distress. See, e.g., In re Educ. Testing Serv. Praxis Principles of Learning &amp; Teaching: Grades 7-12 Litig., 517 F. Supp. 2d 832 (E.D. La. 2007) (test takers could not recover damages for emotional distress resulting from scoring errors by Educational Testing Service); St. Charles v. Kender, 646 N.E.2d 411 (Mass. App. Ct. 1995) (damages for emotional distress may not be recovered from physician who breached contract with patient by not returning telephone calls for two days while patient was having miscarriage).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03a59212-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Restatement test.</i> As noted above, Restatement (Second) §353 suggests that unless bodily harm was also caused by the defendant’s breach, recovery for emotional disturbance should be granted only where either the contract or the breach in question was “of such a kind that serious emotional disturbance was a particularly likely result.” In Illustration 1 to §353, the drafters suggest that recovery for “nervousness and emotional distress” resulting from “delays and departures from specifications” in the building of a house should be denied, even where the defendant had notice that the plaintiff buyer was “in delicate health.”</p>
<p id="03a5b923-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Brooks v. Hickman, 570 F. Supp. 619, 620 (W.D. Pa. 1983), plaintiff sought damages for emotional distress resulting from the defendant’s breach of its contract to provide investment management services, causing loss of the plaintiff’s savings. In denying recovery, the District Court observed:<span title="969" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-969">p. 969</span></p>

<p id="03a5b924-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs argue that emotional distress was a particularly likely result of a breach in this case because plaintiffs sought to build a nest egg for retirement, and defendants were aware of this goal. The instant case is simply not of the same class as the cases cited above. The plaintiffs have not suffered disfigurement, anxiety over death or the birth of an unwanted, crippled child. They have only lost money, and not so much of it as to force personal bankruptcy or impoverishment. See, Restatement (Second) of Contracts, §353, comment. Although loss of money is often disturbing, it does not ordinarily give rise to a claim of emotional distress. We find no Pennsylvania decision permitting recovery of such damages on breach of a contract which caused only a monetary loss, and we hesitate to so extend the rule. Furthermore, even if recovery for emotional distress on such a breach is permitted as intimated in the Comment to §353, the plaintiffs have not alleged such an extreme loss from the breach, and while loss of a nest egg may cause anxiety, it does not appear particularly likely to cause <i>serious</i> emotional distress.</p>

J. 97 (2005)(reviewing U.S. and Canadian reluctance to award mental distress damages for breach of contract and asserting the approach fails to recognize that many contracts contain promise of nonpecuniary benefit).</p>
<p id="03a5b927-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Scholars who employ principles of economic analysis have also argued that the rule denying recovery of damages for emotional distress is unsound because it allows a breaching party to avoid the full costs of his breach and thus produces “inefficient breach.” (The concept of “efficient breach” is examined in Section F of this chapter.)

<p id="03a5b92b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why should punitive, or exemplary, damages be available in tort actions, but not for breach of contract? The standard answer is twofold: First, the damage remedies available in contract are only such as will compensate the plaintiff for harm actually caused and should not put the injured party in a better position than she would have occupied if the contract had been performed. Second, contract law is a system founded not on “fault” but on “strict liability” for the consequences of breach; since culpability plays no part in determining liability it should also play no part in fashioning the remedy. See E. Allan Farnsworth, Contracts §12.8, at 760-761 (4th ed. 2004). To these observations, many modern commentators would add a third: Contract remedies (like the law of contract in general) should promote “efficiency,” and therefore should deter only “inefficient” breaches of contract; punitive damage awards (or, for that matter, any award of more than pure “expectation” damages) could deter even “efficient” breaches, which ought rather to be encouraged. See id. §12.3, at 736. We return to this notion of “efficient breach” in the final section of this chapter.</p>
<p id="03a5b92c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of the major exceptions to the principle that punitive damages are not recoverable for breach of contract involves insurance contracts. Courts around the country have held insurance companies liable in tort to their insureds for bad faith refusal to honor claims brought by third parties. See Douglas R. Richmond, An Overview of Insurance Bad Faith Law and Litigation, 25 Seton Hall L. Rev. 74 (1994).</p>
<p id="03a5e03d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In justifying the imposition of tort liability on insurance companies, the courts have focused on several factors, including the special nature of the relationship between the insurer and the insured, and the insured’s expectation of coverage in the event of a loss. See Noble v. National American Life Insurance Co., 624 P.2d 866, 867-868 (Ariz. 1981) (en banc).</p>
<p id="03a5e03e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts have been very reluctant, however, to extend the tort of bad faith breach of contract beyond the insurance setting. See Freeman &amp; Mills, Inc. v. Belcher Oil Co., 900 P.2d 669 (1995) (holding that recovery of punitive damages for bad faith breach of contract was limited to insurance contracts).</p>
<p id="03a5e03f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In The Case for Punitive Damages in Contracts, 48 Duke L.J. 629 (1999), Professor William Dodge argues that economic efficiency supports a rule that allows punitive damages for any willful breach of contract. Professor Dodge divides willful breaches into two categories: opportunistic and efficient. An opportunistic breach involves an attempt by the breaching party to gain at the expense of the nonbreaching party, for example, by coercing a settlement because the breaching party knows that the other party cannot afford to litigate. An efficient breach occurs when the breaching party seeks to engage in another transaction that is more profitable than the existing <span title="971" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-971">p. 971</span>contract. Professor Dodge agrees with a number of other commentators who have concluded that punitive damages should be awarded to deter opportunistic breaches because such breaches by definition do not increase social wealth. He goes further, however, and argues that punitive damages should be available even in cases of efficient breach because the imposition of punitive damages gives the breaching party an incentive to negotiate with the nonbreaching party to obtain a release from the contract. From an efficiency perspective, negotiation of a release is likely to involve fewer transaction costs than assessment of the nonbreaching party’s damages through litigation. Negotiation of a release also forces the breaching party to share some of the efficiency gains from the new transaction with the nonbreaching party, rather than capturing all of those gains for itself.</p>
<p id="03a5e040-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While recovery of punitive damages for bad faith breach of a noninsurance contract is unlikely in almost all jurisdictions, it should be remembered that punitive damages can be recovered if the defendant’s conduct goes beyond bad faith to amount to an independent tort for which punitive damages are recoverable. Cases that involve fraud or breach of fiduciary duty are likely candidates for such treatment. See, e.g., Formosa Plastics Corp. U.S.A. v. Presidio Engineers &amp; Contractors, Inc., 960 S.W.2d 41 (Tex. 1998) (claim that one party fraudulently induced other party to enter into contract states cause of action in tort justifying award of punitive damages).</p>

<p id="03a5e043-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1987, Gordon and Amy Tan opened a drug store in the city of Newton. During the next 30 years, the Tans devoted themselves to developing their business and to raising their four children. In 2017, when their youngest child graduated from college, the Tans decided that it was time to sell their business, which had grown to 12 stores, and to retire. Through their lawyer, Stewart Taylor, the Tans employed Miranda Evans, a business broker, to assist them in the sale of the business. The Tans and Evans entered into a brokerage contract in which the Tans agreed to pay Evans 5 percent of the sales price of their business as a commission. Under the terms of the contract, 25 percent of the commission was due when the contract was signed, with the balance payable at the closing of the sale.</p>
<p id="03a5e044-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In June 2018, Evans succeeded in finding a purchaser, Simpson’s, Inc., a large regional chain of drug stores. On June 19, 2018, the parties signed a contract of sale in which Simpson’s agreed to purchase the Tan’s 12 stores for a price of $4.5 million. The contract provided for a closing on October 15, 2018. Simpson’s paid an earnest money deposit to Taylor of $250,000. With the approval of the Tans and Simpson’s, Taylor paid from this deposit $56,250 to Evans as payment of the commission due Evans, leaving a balance held by Taylor of $193,750.</p>
<p id="03a5e045-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="972" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-972">p. 972</span>On September 15, 2018, the Tans received a letter from Simpson’s stating that as a result of its due diligence investigation of the Tan’s business, it would no longer be in a position to go forward with the purchase of the Tan’s stores. The Tans immediately consulted with Taylor and Evans about how to proceed. Evans suggested that she would investigate informally what had happened to cause Simpson’s to change its plans. Taylor advised the Tans that they should write to Simpson’s to put it on formal notice that the Tans would insist on their contract rights. They decided, however, to delay this letter for a few days pending the results of Evans’s contacts.</p>
<p id="03a5e046-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A few days later Evans met with Taylor and the Tans. Evans informed them that she had learned that a dramatic restructuring of the retail drug industry was under way, with many existing companies and new entrants beginning to offer drugs over the Internet. Apparently, Simpson’s had decided to follow this route and would be closing, rather than opening or acquiring, new retail outlets.</p>
<p id="03a5e047-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Taylor immediately wrote to Simpson’s stating that Simpson’s was bound contractually to purchase the Tan’s stores, that the Tans insisted on strict compliance with the contract, and that the Tans were ready, willing, and able to proceed with the sale. He demanded that Simpson’s proceed with the closing as scheduled. They received no response to this letter.</p>
<p id="03a5e048-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On October 15, the Tans and Taylor appeared at the closing, but no one appeared on behalf of Simpson’s. Taylor immediately wrote to Simpson’s informing it that Simpson’s had committed a total breach of the contract by failing to appear at the scheduled closing. Taylor informed Simpson’s that the Tans would use their best efforts to attempt to resell the business, but that their sales efforts were with full reservation of all rights to seek to enforce the contract against Simpson’s by action for specific performance or damages.</p>
<p id="03a5e049-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After consultation with Taylor and Evans, the Tans decided to place their stores on the market again and to proceed with a lawsuit against Simpson’s seeking to enforce the contract. The Tans signed a new commission contract with Evans, which contained terms identical to the first contract. Taylor filed suit on behalf of the Tans against Simpson’s for breach of contract.</p>
<p id="03a6075a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In January 2019, Evans informed the Tans that she had received an offer to purchase their stores from Rite-Buy, a large national chain of retail drug stores for a price of $2.5 million. Evans told the Tans that she thought that Rite-Buy was “bottom fishing” because it knew about the failed deal with Simpson’s.</p>
<p id="03a6075b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Tans were in a state of shock and bewilderment from this news. They both believed that the price was grossly inadequate. But, after talking with Taylor and being advised of the “uncertainties of litigation,” they finally concluded that they couldn’t take a chance on being able to find a better offer. They decided to sell to Rite-Buy and to try to hold Simpson’s responsible for damages.</p>
<p id="03a6075c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Tan’s sale to Rite-Buy was originally scheduled to close on March 3, 2019, but it was twice delayed, finally closing on May 15, 2019. Meanwhile, the lawsuit against Simpson’s proceeded through discovery toward trial. The stress of these matters had an effect on the Tans, both of whom worried constantly about Rite-Buy changing its mind and about the lawsuit. Gordon was <span title="973" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-973">p. 973</span>especially affected by these events. He treated Simpson’s refusal to go forward with the contract as a personal insult. In late May, shortly after he gave a deposition in the case, Gordon suffered a heart attack, which was fortunately a relatively mild one.</p>
<p id="03a6075d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As part of discovery, Simpson’s has served interrogatories on the Tans. One of the interrogatories asks them to state the amount and basis of the damages that they claim in the case. In answer to this interrogatory, Taylor has listed the following elements of damage:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-decimal">
<li class=""><p id="03a6075e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The purchase price of the contract totaling $4.5 million.</p></li>

<p id="03a62e78-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the previous sections we have studied the general principles governing remedies for breach of contract with only brief references to the Uniform Commercial Code. In this section we study buyers’ and sellers’ remedies for breach of contracts governed by UCC Article 2. While the Code continues many of the basic principles concerning remedies that we have already studied, it also includes several innovative provisions that have generated a number of interpretive questions. See Victor Goldberg, Remedies in the UCC: Some Critical Thoughts, 23 Barry L. Rev. 155 (2018).</p>
<div id="03a62e79-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="03a62e7a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56">1.&nbsp;Buyers’ Remedies</p></h3></div>

<p id="03a62e7b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A seller may commit a breach of contract in two general ways. First, a seller may deliver goods that fail to “conform” to the contract in some way (breach of an express or implied warranty relating to the “quality” of the goods, most likely). Second, the seller may fail to make a proper “tender” of the goods, <span title="974" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-974">p. 974</span>such as failing to deliver on time, delivering too few or too many, or failing to deliver at all.</p>
<p id="03a62e7c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The buyers’ remedies turn on whether the buyer has “accepted” the goods. §2-608. Acceptance and possession are often, but not always the same. In other words, a buyer may sometimes retain possession of the goods even if the buyer has not accepted the goods; conversely, a buyer’s refusal to take possession may nonetheless legally amount to acceptance under §2-608.</p>
<p id="03a62e7d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the buyer does not have the goods because the seller fails to deliver or the buyer rightfully rejects (§§2-601, 2-602) or revokes acceptance (§2-608), the buyer may recover any part of the price that has been paid under §2-711 and also obtain cover damages under UCC §2-712 or market damages under UCC §2-713. Alternatively, the buyer may pursue specific performance to compel delivery of the goods under §2-716.</p>
<p id="03a62e7e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the buyer has accepted and retained goods despite a nonconformity, the buyer’s damages are determined under §2-714.</p>

<p id="03a62e82-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The traditional rule for measuring damages for a seller’s breach is the contract price–market price difference, similar to that applied to the land sale contract in the <i>Crabby’s</i> case earlier in this chapter. The drafters of Article 2 thought that the market measure of damages was often arbitrary in its application, sometimes overcompensating the buyer who purchased substitute goods at a price lower than the relevant market price, and sometimes undercompensating the buyer when the buyer bought substitute goods at a price greater than the relevant market price. Accordingly, the drafters created a new “cover” measure of damages in UCC §2-712. Roy R. Anderson, The Cover Remedy, 6 J.L. &amp; Commerce 155 (1986). If the buyer complies with the requirements of §2-712, she may recover the difference between the cover price and the contract price, plus incidental and consequential damages. UCC §2-715.</p>
<p id="03a62e83-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To recover damages under §2-712, the covering purchase must be made “in good faith and without unreasonable delay.” As Comment 2 indicates, the buyer need not purchase identical goods, only commercially reasonable substitutes. If the buyer purchases superior or significantly different goods, the purchase will not qualify as cover. Some courts have been willing to expand the scope of the cover section to include situations in which the buyer internally manufactures substitute goods rather than purchase the goods on the market. See Cives Corp. v. Callier Steel Pipe &amp; Tube, Inc., 482 A.2d 852 (Me. 1984) (after seller failed to deliver steel tubing under contract and buyer was unable to locate another supplier, buyer allowed to recover the difference between the cost of manufacturing the tubing in-house and the contract price); but see <span title="975" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-975">p. 975</span>Chronister Oil Co. v. UNOCAL Refining &amp; Marketing, 34 F.3d 462 (7th Cir. 1994) (criticizing courts that allow the buyer to “self-cover” because buyer cannot make a “purchase” from itself).</p>
<p id="03a62e84-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">UCC 2-712(3) provides that cover is elective and failure to cover does not bar the buyer from any other remedy. However, this section must be read in light of the principle of mitigation of damages, expressed in UCC §2-715(2)(a), which allows a buyer to recover consequential damages that meet the foreseeability test of Hadley v. Baxendale, provided the damages “could not reasonably be prevented by cover or otherwise.” Thus, the buyer’s failure to cover will preclude recovery of consequential damages only if she fails to act reasonably.</p>

<p id="03a65597-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the buyer has elected not to purchase substitute goods as cover under UCC §2-712, the buyer may instead recover damages under UCC §2-713. That section provides a basic measure of damages based on the “difference between the market price at the time when the buyer learned of the breach and the contract price.” Under §2-713(2) the relevant market is the place for tender and the place of tender depends on where the seller completes its delivery obligations with respect to the goods. In “shipment” contracts the seller tenders by placing the goods in the hands of a carrier, while in “destination” contracts tender takes place when the goods are delivered to a designated point, often the buyer’s place of business or locale. UCC §§2-503, 2-504. The typical commercial contract will contain a delivery term that will define the seller’s delivery obligations and thereby identify the relevant market price for measuring damages.</p>
<p id="03a65598-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose the buyer has covered, but the market price at the time and place of delivery is more than the cover price. May the buyer elect to forgo damages under the cover section and recover the greater amount of damages under the market damage section? The Code seems unclear on this point. Comment 3 to §2-712 states, “The buyer is always free to choose between cover and damages for nondelivery under the next section.” However, Comment 5 to §2-713 provides that the market value rule applies “only when and to the extent that the buyer has not covered.” Moreover, UCC §1-305 provides that the purpose of remedies under the Code is to place “the aggrieved party . . . in as good a position as if the other party had fully performed.” Most commentators agree that in this situation the buyer should be limited to damages measured under the cover section. See, e.g., John A. Sebert, Jr., Remedies Under Article Two of the Uniform Commercial Code: An Agenda for Review, 130 U. Pa. L. Rev. 360, 380-383 (1981).</p>
<p id="03a65599-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose the seller has committed an anticipatory repudiation and the buyer fails or elects not to cover. As of what point in time should the market measure of damages be determined? This question has proved difficult for the courts because of uncertainty about the meaning of the phrase <i>learned of the <span title="976" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-976">p. 976</span>breach</i> in §2-713. Three interpretations have been offered, each of which has its scholarly advocates and its support in case law:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-decimal">
<li class=""><p id="03a6559a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">the date when the buyer learns of the repudiation;</p></li>

</ol>
<p id="03a6559d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plain meaning of the section supports the first interpretation. The buyer’s right to await performance by a repudiating party for a commercially reasonable time under UCC §2-610(a) supports the second approach. White and Summers argue for the third alternative based on legislative history and comparison with other Code provisions. See White &amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code (6th ed. 2010) §7-7, at 332-333.

Under that section, the buyer may recover those damages that result “in the ordinary course of events from the seller’s breach.” More specifically, if the damages are caused by a breach of warranty, UCC §2-714(2) provides that the measure of damages is “the difference at the time and place of acceptance between the value of the goods accepted and the value they would have had if they had been as warranted, unless special circumstances show proximate damages of a different amount.” For example, if an automobile is delivered with a different and lower priced set of tires than specified in the contract, the buyer would be able to recover the difference in the value (probably based on market prices) between the two sets of tires. Section 2-714(3) goes on to authorize incidental and consequential damages. It is important to note that if the buyer retains the goods despite nonconformity in the goods or the seller’s tender, the buyer must give notice to the seller within reasonable period of time, under §2-607(3)(a), in order to preserve the right to collect a remedy.</p>

<p id="03a655a3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You may recall from an earlier overview of remedies in Chapter 2 and other discussion in this book that the principal alternative remedies for a nonbreaching party are money damages or equitable relief. The most common form of equitable remedy is specific performance, a judicial decree compelling the breaching party to render the performance required by the contract. In Chapter 11 we will see that the common law imposes various restrictions on the award of specific performance, particularly the requirement that the remedy of money damages be inadequate. In §2-716 the drafters of the Code made an effort to <span title="977" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-977">p. 977</span>liberalize the award of specific performance. Under that section, specific performance “may” be decreed in the buyer’s favor where the goods are “unique,” or in “other proper circumstances.” If goods are readily available on the market, a court applying the Code is likely to deny specific performance. Klein v. Pepsico, Inc., 845 F.2d 76 (4th Cir. 1988) (error to award specific performance of contract to sell airplane when comparable planes available on the market). Where substitute goods or a substitute contract are not available, the courts may be more willing to grant the remedy. See, e.g., Laclede Gas Co. v. Amoco Oil Co., 522 F.2d 33 (8th Cir. 1975) (specific performance granted of long-term requirements contract to supply propane; while propane was currently available to plaintiff under short-term contracts with other suppliers, it had “no assurance” that this situation would continue).</p>

<p id="03a67cba-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The section makes a distinction between economic or commercial loss, such as lost profits (subsection (a)), and damage to person or property (subsection (b)). The former is subject to the foreseeability test of Hadley v. Baxendale, which we studied in Section B of this chapter (“which the seller at the time of contracting had reason to know”) and to the mitigation principle (“could not reasonably be prevented by cover or otherwise”). The Code rejects the “tacit agreement” formulation of the foreseeability test as discussed in the notes after the <i>Hadley v. Baxendale</i> case. UCC §2-715, Comment 2. Under subsection (b), damages for injury to person or property are not subject to the foreseeability test. Comment 4 to §2-715 states that damages must be proved by the buyer with reasonable certainty but not mathematical precision.</p>

Last August it ordered 98,195 pounds of high-carbon cold-rolled steel from Southern Steel, Inc., for use in the fabrication of springs used in the assembly of automobile clutches. The purchase order set forth the specifications of the steel, which were critical because of the requirements for manufacture of the springs. Southern delivered the steel in <span title="978" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-978">p. 978</span>coils to Bing on January 26 and 28. In accordance with its usual practice, Bing checked the steel for dimensional accuracy and chemical content and began partial fabrication of the steel into “blanks.” It then stored the blanks, awaiting orders from its customers. Recently Bing removed the pieces from storage and resumed the fabrication process. During this processing, Bing noticed that the springs exhibited cracks and other failures. Bing immediately gave notice of the problem to Southern, which did extensive testing of the steel. A dispute has developed: Southern claims that Bing improperly processed the steel, while Bing contends that the steel was defective. Because of the problem with the steel, Bing is late on delivery of springs under a contract and runs the risk of having the contract canceled. Bing has sought your advice about how to proceed legally. What advice would you give?</p>

<p id="03a67cc0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the section on buyers’ remedies, we saw that the Code has modified the common law rules in several ways; in particular, a buyer has the option of recovering damages under the Code’s rule on cover rather than under the traditional rule of market damages. For sellers, the Code adopts a similar provision, the right of “resale.” UCC §2-706. In addition, the Code includes a new rule allowing a seller, under certain circumstances, to recover damages based on his lost profit. UCC §2-708(2). Analysis of sellers’ remedies begins with §2-703, which outlines the seller’s rights in the event the buyer breaches the contract. The measurement of the seller’s damages depends partly on whether the buyer has accepted the goods based on the definition of acceptance in §2-606. If not, the seller may recover either resale damages, UCC §2-706, market damages, UCC §2-708(1), or lost profit, UCC §2-708(2). If the goods have been accepted, or are not reasonably subject to resale, the seller may recover the contract price under UCC §2-709.</p>

<p id="03a67cc3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 2-706 allows a seller to resell goods after a breach by the buyer and “recover the difference between the resale price and the contract price.” This remedy is the equivalent of the buyer’s right to cover. The seller must follow three basic steps to recover damages under §2-706. First, the seller must identify the goods being resold as the same ones under the contract that was breached. Second, the seller must give the buyer proper notice of resale. For private sales, “the seller must give the buyer reasonable notification of his intention to resell.” UCC §2-706(3). For public sales, the seller must give the buyer reasonable notice of the time and place of the resale except in the case of goods which are perishable or otherwise may quickly decline in value. UCC §2-706(4)(b).</p>
<p id="03a67cc4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, the seller’s resale must be made in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner. UCC §2-706(1). If the seller engages in a “sham” resale to a friendly purchaser or an affiliated entity, the court should not allow the seller to recover damages under the section. E.g., Coast Trading Co. v. Cudahy Co., <span title="979" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-979">p. 979</span>592 F.2d 1074 (9th Cir. 1979) (seller entered into a “paper contract apparently intended to serve only as basis for calculating resale damages”). The fact that in hindsight a better price could have been obtained, however, does not make a sale unreasonable. Finnish Fur Sales Co. v. Juliette Shulof Furs, Inc., 770 F. Supp. 139 (S.D.N.Y. 1991) (seller sold at regularly scheduled auctions at prevailing prices; unreasonable for seller to suspend its operations to await higher world prices).</p>

<p id="03a6a3d7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As is the case with buyers, the Code contains a traditional contract price minus market value damage formula for sellers in UCC §2-708(1). The major problem in interpreting this section is the interrelationship between it and §2-706, the resale section. Suppose a seller has in fact resold goods identified to the contract. May the seller recover damages under §2-708(1) if that section would produce a greater recovery than the formula of §2-706? This situation can arise when the market price at the time and place for tender is less than the resale price. On the one hand, Comment 2 to §2-706 suggests that a seller who fails to follow the requirements for resale under that section is left to the remedy under §2-708(1). On the other hand, Professors White and Summers argue that a seller who has resold should not be entitled to recover greater damages under §2-708(1) than under §2-706. In their view, such a result would contravene the principle of awarding only compensatory damages as expressed in §1-305. White &amp; Summers, §8-7, at 362. See Tesoro Petroleum Corp. v. Holborn Oil Co., 547 N.Y.S.2d 1012 (Sup. Ct. 1989) (following the White and Summers approach).</p>
<p id="03a6a3d8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professor Roy Anderson agrees that the nonbreaching party, whether a buyer or a seller, should not be able to receive greater damages under the market damages section than the party would have received by cover or resale. See Roy R. Anderson, A Look Back at the Future of UCC Damages Remedies, 71 SMU L. Rev. 185 (2018). By contrast, Professor Jennifer Martin argues for a more balanced approach to “section 2-708(1) that preserves the aggrieved seller’s right to elect its remedy in most cases, subject to a limit of the seller achieving the position equivalent to full contractual performance only.” See Jennifer S, Martin, Opportunistic Resales and the Uniform Commercial Code, 2016 U. Ill. L. Rev. 487, 525.</p>

<p id="03a6a3db-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As an alternative to the market price measure of damages, UCC §2-708(2) authorizes courts to award lost profits to sellers if the market measure of damages set forth in §2-708(1) is “inadequate to put the seller in as good a position as performance would have done.” Case law and commentary have identified three situations in which §2-708(2) should apply. The first of these is usually referred to as the case of the “lost volume seller.” Recall the <i>Jetz Service</i> case earlier in this chapter. If the buyer breaches and the seller makes a resale of the same item, the seller may collect lost profits if it can prove that it had the capacity to make both sales and that both sales would have been profitable. <span title="980" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-980">p. 980</span>For example, a dealer who sells rather fungible new cars may argue that it has practically unlimited supply. The burden of proving its status as a lost volume seller is on the seller. See Razorback Concrete Co. v. Dement Constr. Co., LLC, 688 F.3d 346, 352 (8th Cir. 2012). Professor Goldberg argues that recovery of lost profits overcompensates the lost volume seller; instead, he contends that these cases should be treated as ones in which the buyer has an implied option to cancel, and damages should be measured by a cancellation charge. Further, “[i]n the absence of an explicit option price, the default rule should set the price at zero.” Goldberg, Remedies in the UCC: Some Critical Thoughts, 23 Barry L. Rev. at 161-164.</p>
<p id="03a6a3dc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Note that Section 2-708(2) requires “due credit for payments or proceeds of resale.” This phrase has proved troublesome in the “lost volume seller” cases. If the total proceeds of the seller’s resale are deducted, the profit recovery under §2-708(2) would be negated because the resale price also includes seller’s profit. Courts have avoided this problem by interpreting the “due credit” language to apply only when the seller sells uncompleted or otherwise unmarketable goods for scrap. See R.E. Davis Chemical Corp. v. Diasonics, Inc., 826 F.2d 678, 684 (7th Cir. 1987).</p>
<p id="03a6a3dd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second situation in which §2-708(2) has been applied involves a seller who is in the process of assembling a product for sale when the buyer breaches. While the seller could complete manufacture of the product and attempt to resell it on the open market, it might not be commercially reasonable to do this (for example, if the goods were specialty items without an established market). See UCC §2-704(2). Awarding lost profits based on the contract price minus the cost of production would be perhaps the only way to compensate the seller.</p>
<p id="03a6a3de-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, §2-708(2) has been applied in the case of the “jobber,” a middle person who purchases goods for resale. If the buyer from a jobber breaches before the jobber has acquired the goods, courts may award lost profits as the best measure of the seller’s harm. See Blair International, Ltd. v. LaBarge, Inc., 675 F.2d 954 (8th Cir. 1982) (jobber of oil casings allowed to recover lost profits); TCP Industries, Inc. v. Uniroyal, Inc., 661 F.2d 542 (6th Cir. 1981) (intermediary for chemicals allowed to recover lost profits).</p>
<p id="03a6a3df-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 2-708(2) states that it applies if the market value measure of damages is “inadequate” to put the seller in as good a position as full performance by the buyer. May a seller elect to recover market value damages under §2-708(1), if the measure of recovery under that section <i>exceeds</i> his lost profit in the transaction? We have previously encountered similar questions concerning whether a covering buyer or a reselling seller elect market damages if that measure would produce a greater recovery? In each situation, the same arguments have reappeared. The language and legislative history of the Code favor allowing the election by the nonbreaching party, while the principle of compensation supports the opposite view. The courts are divided. See Nobs Chemical, U.S.A., Inc. v. Koppers Co., 616 F.2d 212 (5th Cir. 1980) (acknowledging ambiguity in §2-708 and limiting seller to lost profit even though market damages would have been greater).</p>

<p id="03a6a3e2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The seller may recover the price of the goods from the buyer as damages under §2-709 in three situations. First, if the buyer has accepted the goods, then the seller may recover the price under §2-709(1)(a). Second, under the same section, the seller may recover the price if the goods are damaged after the risk of loss has passed to the buyer. In both of these situations, the buyer has effectively received the goods and thus should pay the contract price. Third, the seller may recover the price under §2-709(1)(b), and essentially force the goods onto the buyer, if the seller is unable to resell the goods with reasonable effort. Although neither §2-709(1)(b) nor its comments use the phrase <i>specific performance</i>, it appears that the section is the analogue of §2-716, which makes specific performance available to the buyer. See Schumann v. Levi, 728 F.2d 1141 (8th Cir. 1984) (“the equitable remedy of specific performance and the Uniform Commercial Code’s action for the price are virtually identical”).</p>

Section 2-710 does not contain any reference to consequential damages, perhaps because the drafters of the Code were persuaded that sellers rarely suffer consequential damages that would not be compensated by the damage measures discussed above. White and Summers argue that, despite the language of §2-710, courts should rely on common law principles via §1-103(b) and allow sellers to recover consequential damages in appropriate cases.

At 9 <span class="epub-small-caps">a.m.</span> on August 15 McBride’s truck pulled up at the Johnson facility. The delivery driver, Charlotte McBride, gave an invoice to the Johnson agent at the unloading docks. She pointed out that the invoice showed 4,800 bushels of “large” peaches and 200 bushels of “small” peaches. (In the trade, small peaches are not as marketable as large ones, selling to buyers like Johnson Food for approximately $2 per bushel.) She also noted that the invoice price ($19,600) had been adjusted by $400 to reflect the small peaches. The agent said he would have to “check with the boss.” He returned a few minutes later to say that the peaches were unacceptable and could not be unloaded. McBride asked to talk with the boss, who told her that he was “sick and tired” of “farmers making deliveries any way they wanted.” He said that McBride should have obtained <span title="982" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-982">p. 982</span>approval first, not just “showed up” with the small peaches. McBride offered to leave only the large peaches, but the Johnson agent refused and ordered her to leave. McBride returned with the peaches to her farm, and left them at the McBride Cannery, a subsidiary operation that cans unmarketable peaches. On its books, the Cannery recorded a credit of $5,000 for McBride Farms, treating the peaches as costing $1 per bushel. Subsequently, the Cannery completed canning the peaches; its manufacturing costs for doing so were $3,000. McBride has now brought suit against Johnson Food Distributors for breach of contract.

<p id="03a6cafb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the beginning of our survey of the rules governing contract damages, we posed — but did not then attempt to answer — two questions about the expectation–damage principle: Why should contract law allow recovery of the plaintiff’s full expectation of gain under the breached contract, even in cases where the plaintiff has not yet performed, expended any resources in preparations for performance, or substantially relied in any other way on the contract at issue? Conversely, why should the law ordinarily award <i>no more than</i> expectation damages for breach of contract, denying to most contract plaintiffs the sorts of exemplary or punitive damages often available in tort actions? In this section, we will consider some answers that have been given to these questions.</p>
<div id="03a6cafc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="03a6cafd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56">1.&nbsp;Protecting the Expectation Interest Under a Wholly Executory Contract</p></h3></div>

<p id="03a6cafe-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In many cases where enforcement of a contractual obligation is sought, it is clear that the party seeking enforcement has relied in a variety of ways, substantial and insubstantial, on her expectation that the defendant’s promised performance would be rendered. In many such cases, the defendant promisor has also received some benefit from the plaintiff’s actions, so that the defendant would be unjustly enriched if his promise were to go completely unenforced. In such cases, the plaintiff’s reliance or restitution interest may therefore appear to require compensation in damages. But not every breach of contract will necessarily involve such injury. Since the law recognizes an exchange of purely executory promises as sufficient in itself to create a contract, there is no theoretical barrier to enforcement where the defendant promisor has breached his promise at a time when the plaintiff promisee had neither performed nor relied (in any but a purely psychological way) on the defendant’s promise of performance. In such a case, the only remedial interest that has been injured is the plaintiff’s expectation interest. Aside from the internal logic of the rule-structure itself, what justifies the law’s willingness <span title="983" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-983">p. 983</span>to award an expectation-based remedy to a plaintiff who has not been demonstrably injured in any quantifiable or even tangible way by the defendant’s breach?</p>
<p id="03a6caff-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In their landmark 1936 article, Professor Lon Fuller and his associate William Perdue attempted to answer that question. After rejecting the “psychological” explanation for the award of expectation damages, Fuller and Perdue argue that expectation damages can be justified to compensate for what could be called “hidden reliance”:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03a6cb00-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is a cure for these losses in the sense that it offers the measure of recovery most likely to reimburse the plaintiff for the (often very numerous and very difficult to prove) individual acts and forbearances which make up his total reliance on the contract. . . . Physicians with an extensive practice often charge their patients the full office call fee for broken appointments. Such a charge looks on the face of things like a claim to the promised fee; it seems to be based on the “expectation interest.” Yet the physician making the charge will quite justifiably regard it as compensation for the loss of the opportunity to gain a similar fee from a different patient. This foregoing of other opportunities is involved to some extent in entering most contracts, and the impossibility of subjecting this type of reliance to any kind of measurement may justify a categorical rule granting the value of the expectancy as the most effective way of compensating for such losses. . . . </p>

<p id="03a6cb01-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fuller and Perdue go on to offer a second justification for expectation damages: “a policy in favor of promoting and facilitating reliance on business agreements.” Lon L.

<p id="03a6cb02-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In contrast to Fuller and Perdue, English historian P.S. Atiyah has asserted that the law’s readiness to protect a promisee’s expectation under a completely executory bilateral contract (i.e., one that has been neither performed nor relied on) is a relatively recent development. Atiyah has also argued that cases where enforcement of a completely executory contract is sought are much rarer in real life than in contract theory:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03a6cb03-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is, I think, worth observing that wholly executory contracts are generally nothing like as binding in practice as legal theory might suggest. Consumers and even business men often expect to be able to cancel executory agreements with the minimum of penalty, paying perhaps only for actual expenses laid out in reliance on the promise. And such reliance expenditures would, by definition, not exist if the arrangement were still wholly executory. . . . Where there is no difference in the market price of the goods or services which are the subject of the contract, and the market price of comparable goods or services, the contract may in law be broken with impunity. In practice this must comprise a high proportion of cases in which executory arrangements are broken. Then again, the binding force of wholly executory contracts is normally of an ephemeral nature. Executory contracts do not normally remain executory for very long. Even if made well before the time for performance, the whole purpose of making them is frequently to enable the parties to make preliminary arrangements in confident reliance on reciprocal performance. Thus action in reliance is likely to follow hard on the heels of the making of most executory contracts. . . . </p>

<p id="03a6cb05-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a 1982 article, The Bargain Principle and Its Limits, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 741, Professor Melvin Eisenberg critically examines in a variety of situations the principle that bargained-for promises should be enforced to the full extent of the expectation created thereby. In the half-completed contract, when one party has rendered full performance and seeks the return performance or its value from the breaching party, both fairness and efficiency support an award of expectation damages. By contrast, when the contract is infected by some form of overreaching, such as unconscionability, neither fairness nor efficiency justify expectation damages: Either restitution or no remedy are likely to be more appropriate.</p>
<p id="03a6f216-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Eisenberg then addresses the “pure” case for the recovery of expectation damages, where the plaintiff has not performed at all, even partially. Assuming that the contract in question is not in any degree tainted by some form of unconscionability, should the plaintiff’s expectation interest be protected by enforcing the contract? Eisenberg asserts that at least three policies can be identified that may justify full-bargain enforcement: (1) assured protection of the full cost of reliance (which Eisenberg calls the “surrogate-cost theory”); (2) facilitation of planning (by deterring breach in most cases); (3) protection of a risk-allocation that the contract was created to effectuate (e.g., a contract for future delivery at a fixed price, made in order to allocate the risk of price changes between the time of contract and the time set for performance). He then applies this analysis to a number of contracts between business concerns and concludes that in most cases full-bargain enforcement can be justified on the basis of one or more of these policies. Melvin A. Eisenberg, The Bargain Principle and Its Limits, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 741, 788-789 (1982).</p>
<p id="03a6f217-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose, however, that the contract at issue is not between two commercial concerns, but between a merchant and a consumer. Here Eisenberg’s analysis produces somewhat different results. In contracts for services to consumers (e.g., education, fitness, language) Eisenberg’s policies do not support an award to businesses of full expectation damages; in these situations the seller’s interest in planning and the buyer’s expectations would justify an award of a cancellation charge, which could be set by the seller in the contract provided it was reasonable. Id. at 794-797.</p>
<p id="03a6f218-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If Professor Atiyah’s observations above are as correct as intuitively they seem to be, the number of cases in which a court is asked to enforce a completely executory agreement (both unperformed and unrelied on) will be relatively few. In the absence of injury to either the reliance or the restitution interest of the plaintiff, the arguments for full-bargain enforcement seem much less compelling. When such a case does arise, therefore, it should not be surprising to find the court seeking some basis for denying enforcement — particularly where the defendant is a consumer who may not have prepared for or even foreseen the possibility of substantial liability.</p>

<p id="03a6f21b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rules governing remedies for breach of contract have often been referred to (sometimes with favor, sometimes not) as “amoral.” Perhaps the most frequently quoted passage in support of this view is from an address delivered in 1897 by Oliver Wendell Holmes, then Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, at the dedication of a new hall at the Boston University School of Law. Speaking first of the necessity for law students to avoid the fallacy of assuming “law” and “morality” to be synonymous, Holmes went on to give some examples of the divergence between them.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03a6f21c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nowhere is the confusion between legal and moral ideas more manifest than in the law of contract. . . . The duty to keep a contract at common law means a prediction that you must pay damages if you do not keep it — and nothing else. If you commit a tort, you are liable to pay a compensatory sum. If you commit a [breach of] contract, you are liable to pay a compensatory sum unless the promised event comes to pass, and that is all the difference. But such a mode of looking at the matter stinks in the nostrils of those who think it advantageous to get as much ethics into the law as they can.</p>

<p id="03a6f21e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">that in some instances equity does what is called compelling specific performance. But . . . [t]his remedy is an exceptional one. The only universal consequence of a legally binding promise is, that the law makes the promisor pay damages if the promised event does not come to pass. In every case it leaves him free from interference until the time for fulfillment has gone by, and therefore free to break his contract if he chooses.</p>

<p id="03a6f220-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To Holmes, it may be that these statements represented an effort to direct our thinking toward the possibility that law is primarily the product of social forces whose nature as “good” or “evil” may be debatable, but whose existence and effect cannot be denied. This thought is most pithily expressed in what are perhaps Holmes’s best-known words: “The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience.” Id. at 1. Others, however, have seen in Holmes’s observations about contract law a challenge to both morals and logic. If indeed the law of contract does take an “amoral” view of contract-breaking behavior, why has this been so? And, indeed, <i>should</i> it be so?</p>
<p id="03a6f221-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The view that Holmes’s observation is correct both historically and philosophically has been most energetically advanced by writers of the law and economics school, led by Richard Posner. Holmes’s statement that the breaching party is merely required to choose between performance and compensation contains, Posner asserts, “an important economic insight.” Richard A. Posner, Economic Analysis of Law 128-129 (9th ed. 2014). “In many cases,” Posner continues,<span title="986" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-986">p. 986</span></p>

<p id="03a6f222-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">it is uneconomical to induce completion of performance of a contract after it has been broken. I agree to purchase 100,000 widgets custom-ground for use as components in a machine that I manufacture. After I have taken delivery of 10,000, the market for my machine collapses. I promptly notify my supplier that I am terminating the contract and admit that my termination is a breach. When notified of the termination he has not yet begun the custom grinding of the other 90,000 widgets, but he informs me that he intends to complete his performance under the contract and bill me accordingly. The custom-ground widgets have no use other than in my machine and a negligible scrap value. To give the supplier a remedy that induced him to complete the contract would cause a waste of valuable resources. The law is alert to this danger and, under the rubric of mitigation of damages, would deny the supplier damages for costs he incurred in continuing production after the notice of termination. . . . </p>
<p id="03a6f223-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose the contract is broken by the seller rather than by the buyer. I really need those 100,000 custom-ground widgets for my machine, but the supplier, after producing 50,000, is forced to suspend production. Other sellers are in a position to supply the remaining widgets that I need, but I insist that the promisor complete his performance of the contract. If the law compels completion, the supplier will have to make arrangements with other producers in order to be able to complete the performance of his contract with me. Probably it will be more costly for him to procure an alternative supplier than for me to do so directly (after all, I know my own needs best); otherwise he would have done it voluntarily, to minimize his liability for the breach. To compel completion of the contract (or costly negotiations to discharge the promisor) in such a case would again waste resources, and so again the law limits the victim to seeking damages.</p>
<p id="03a71934-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What should those damages be? The objective of giving the promisor an incentive to fulfill his promise unless the result would be an inefficient use of resources can be achieved by giving the promisee his expected profit on the transaction. If the supplier in the first example (buyer breach) receives his expected profit from making 10,000 [sic 100,000?] widgets, he will have no incentive to make the unwanted 90,000. We do not want him to make them; no one wants them. In the second example (seller breach), if I receive my expected profit from dealing with the original seller, I become indifferent to whether he completes his performance.</p>

<p id="03a71936-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It should be remembered at this point that in many cases where performance is in some sense “impossible” or even “impracticable,” the law will in fact excuse the nonperforming party from the duty of performance, in which case no damages at all would be awarded. (Recall our discussion in Chapter 8.) But Posner’s analysis is not limited to cases where the breach is “involuntary.” The same result should follow, he continues, even in some cases where the breaching party could perform, but chooses not to do so.</p>

<p id="03a71939-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many commentators have echoed Posner’s view that when nonperformance (in order to permit entry into a substitute, more profitable transaction) would be “efficient,” the law should not only permit breach but indeed regard it as appropriate behavior to be encouraged rather than condemned. See Charles J. Goetz &amp; Robert E. Scott, Liquidated Damages, Penalties, and the Just Compensation Principle: Some Notes on an Enforcement Model and a Theory of Efficient Breach, 77 Colum. L. Rev. 554, 558 (1977). See also Richard Caswell, Contract Remedies, Renegotiation, and the Theory of Efficient Breach, 61 S. Cal. L. Rev. 629 (1988); and Robert L. Birmingham, Breach of Contract, Damage Measures, and Economic Efficiency, 24 Rutgers L. Rev. 273, 291 (1970) (applying the theory of efficient breach to personal service contracts to allow an employer in a market of falling wages to discharge an employee and hire a new employee at a lower wage, so long as the fired employee is compensated for his loss of wages).</p>
<p id="03a7193a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Criticism of the doctrine of efficient breach has taken a number of forms. Many writers emphasize that the theory of efficient breach ignores “transaction costs,” particularly attorney fees incurred by the nonbreaching party for litigation or negotiation of a settlement. As we saw in the previous section, such fees are ordinarily not recoverable as damages for breach of contract. As a result, application of the principle of efficient breach will often undercompensate the nonbreaching party. Critics also point to the traditional limitations on expectation damages (including not only the denial of reimbursement for litigation costs, but also the requirements of foreseeability and certainty) as virtually guaranteeing that the nonbreaching party will be undercompensated if breach does occur. See generally Daniel A. Farber, Reassessing the Economic Efficiency of Compensatory Damages for Breach of Contract, 66 Va. L. Rev. 1443 (1980); Richard Schiro, Prospecting for Lost Profits in the Uniform Commercial Code: The Buyer’s Dilemmas, 52 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1727 (1979).</p>
<p id="03a7193b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To remedy these defects, the theory of efficient breach would need to be modified to allow for compensation for transaction costs and to loosen the rules limiting the recovery of “nonforeseeable” or “speculative” damages, to increase the likelihood that the actual injury resulting from breach will be fully compensated. See Farber, supra at 1443-1445 (calling for the recovery of “supercompensatory” damages, calculated to compensate the plaintiff for <span title="988" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-988">p. 988</span>some of the major transaction costs incurred as a result of breach) and Schiro, supra (suggesting a substantial modification of the rules limiting the recovery of “nonforeseeable” or “speculative” damages, to increase the likelihood that the actual injury resulting from breach will be fully compensated).</p>
<p id="03a7193c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another thread of criticism of the theory of efficient breach focuses on specific performance as an alternative to damages as a remedy for breach of contract. Professor Ian Macneil argues that if courts award specific performance (i.e., a breaching party will be ordered to specifically perform his contractual duty), rather than expectation damages, the result will be both efficient and fairer to the nonbreaching party. When a court orders specific performance, the parties will bargain among themselves to reach this result: The party who has available a more profitable second contract will buy his way out of the first one (rather than simply breaching it). Thus, the goods will still end up being allocated to their most highly valued use, but some of the resulting gain will have gone to the other party to the original contract. Ian R. Macneil, Efficient Breach of Contract: Circles in the Sky, 68 Va. L. Rev. 947, 951-952 (1982). See also Alan Schwartz, The Case for Specific Performance, 89 Yale L.J. 271 (1979).</p>
<p id="03a7193d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More fundamentally, a number of critics question the moral foundations of the theory of efficient breach. Professor Daniel Friedman argues that the theory of efficient breach fails to recognize that contractual rights, like property rights, are entitlements of which a person should not be deprived without his consent. Daniel Friedmann, The Efficient Breach Fallacy, 18 J. Legal Stud. 1, 6-7 (1989) (arguing also that the theory is itself inefficient because it often produces multiple transactions including “protracted negotiations, or even litigation, over difficult questions of fact and law” and sometimes “an expensive tort action for inducement of breach of contract”). Professor Macneil points out that the theory is founded on a “bias is in favor of individual, uncooperative behavior as opposed to behavior requiring the cooperation of the parties.” Macneil, supra at 968-969. Professor Patricia Marschall contends that promotion of economic efficiency is neither a “realistic” nor a “proper” goal for contract law. She urges courts to distinguish between willful and nonwillful breaches, awarding either specific performance or the highest measure of compensatory damages for the former. In addition, punitive damages should be available when the breach is not only willful, but also made in unreasonable disregard of the other party. Patricia H. Marschall, Willfulness: A Crucial Factor in Choosing Remedies for Breach of Contract, 24 Ariz. L. Rev. 733, 761 (1982). Professor Peter Linzer stresses that while economic efficiency is an important value in the law, fairness and justice are more important. He calls on courts to award specific performance for breach of promise rather than a “diluted substitute” of money damages. Peter Linzer, On the Amorality of Contract Remedies—Efficiency, Equity and the Second Restatement, 81 Colum. L. Rev. 111, 139 (1981). See also George M. Cohen, The Fault Lines in Contract Damages, 80 Va. L. Rev. 1225 (1994) (arguing for a fault-based theory of contract damages).</p>

<p id="03a74059-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This suit was brought by plaintiff (employer) against defendant (employee) for breach of a written contract of employment. Trial by the court resulted in a finding and judgment for plaintiff for one dollar. Plaintiff appeals.</p>
<p id="03a7405a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff testified that he was the owner of a beauty salon in Silver Spring, Maryland; that his business was seasonal; and that on April 15, 1955, by a written contract he agreed to employ defendant as a hairdresser for one year. Defendant’s salary was to be $75 a week or a commission of fifty percent on the gross receipts from his work, whichever sum was greater. Defendant remained in his employ for approximately six and one-half months and then left. Plaintiff testified that from the beginning defendant earned his salary, needed no special training, and soon built up and maintained a following because of his exceptional skill and talent.</p>
<p id="03a7405b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff also testified that his net profit was seven percent of the gross receipts per hairdresser. To substantiate this he introduced defendant’s statement of earnings, which reflected gross receipts and salary paid to him. Plaintiff testified that in an effort to mitigate his damages he employed another person “to whom he paid $350, which was a complete loss and he had to let this employee go.” He then hired still another operator who even at the date of trial was not earning his salary, and was thus employed at a loss to plaintiff. A witness for plaintiff testified that he had been the owner of a beauty salon for many years; that defendant had been in his employ since November 1, 1955, at a weekly salary of $100; and that defendant was a very good operator.</p>
<p id="03a7676c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant testified that he left because conditions in plaintiff’s shop were unbearable; that he complained to plaintiff on numerous occasions; that he had asked for more money but that salary was not the main reason for his leaving; and that he was presently earning $100 per week.</p>
<p id="03a7676d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The sole question presented is what damages plaintiff was entitled to under these circumstances. Plaintiff argues that the trial court did not consider the value of defendant’s services or the profits lost by plaintiff and therefore erroneously limited the award to nominal damages. It is established law that where a plaintiff proves a breach of a contractual duty he is entitled to damages; however, when he offers no proof of actual damages or the proof is vague and speculative, he is entitled to no more than nominal damages. While the facts warrant application of this principle to plaintiff’s claim concerning lost profits, we think there was proof of actual damage and that the evidence with regard to the value of defendant’s services provided an accurate measure of such damage.</p>
<p id="03a7676e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="991" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-991">p. 991</span>The measure of damages for breach of an employment contract by an employee is the cost of obtaining other service equivalent to that promised and not performed. Compensation for additional consequential injury may be recovered if at the time the contract was made the employee had reason to foresee that such injury would result from his breach. However, we need not concern ourselves with the foreseeability of lost profits resulting from defendant’s breach since plaintiff’s proof on this point was at most conjectural and speculative. He introduced defendant’s statement of earnings, which reflected gross receipts and salary paid to defendant, and testified that his net profit was seven percent of such gross receipts per hairdresser. However, he also testified that his business was seasonal. The matter was further complicated by the testimony of both plaintiff and defendant to the effect that an employee assigned the customers and that some customers requested a particular operator. It can be seen then that defendant’s gross receipts, and hence plaintiff’s seven percent profit, depended on a number of contingencies — the seasonal fluctuations of business, defendant’s skill and industry, and the judgment of the employee who assigned the operators. There was no criterion by which the trial court could have estimated plaintiff’s profits with the degree of certainty necessary to allow their recovery; therefore they were not within the range of recoverable damages.</p>
<p id="03a7676f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There remains the question as to the value of defendant’s services. Defendant was evidently a hairdresser of exceptional talent. This is demonstrated not only by the fact that he experienced no difficulty in securing and retaining another position at a higher salary, but also by plaintiff’s own testimony that he was unable to hire a satisfactory substitute. Defendant did not claim that he was required to render services other than those in his original contract with plaintiff in order to obtain a higher salary from his new employer, nor did plaintiff prove by expert testimony how much such services would bring in the market. But plaintiff did prove the amount defendant actually received. Under such circumstances, there was some evidence of the value of defendant’s services and therefore of the cost of replacement. As was said in Triangle Waist Co. v. Todd, 223 N.Y. 27, 119 N.E. 85, 86:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03a76770-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If one agrees to sell something to another, and then, the next day, sells it to someone else at an advance, the new transaction is not to be ignored in estimating the buyer’s loss. . . . The rule is not different when one sells one’s labor. The price received upon a genuine sale either of property or of service is some evidence of value. . . . </p>
</div>
<p id="03a76771-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Twenty-four weeks yet remained when defendant abandoned his contract and obtained employment elsewhere at a higher salary. Until this new compensation is disproved as the value of his services, it may be presumed to be the fair value. That it was the fair value of defendant’s services was partially supported by plaintiff’s unsuccessful efforts to obtain a comparable replacement. Seemingly, plaintiff would have had to pay $100 a week in order to obtain an equally talented hairdresser, if one could have been found. If this be so, plaintiff, having contracted for defendant’s services at a guaranteed wage of $75 per week, would be entitled to the difference between the two salaries for the <span title="992" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-992">p. 992</span>remainder of the contract period. The fact that defendant was entitled to a fifty-percent commission on his gross receipts — if such receipts were more than his salary — should not be a deterrent to the application of this measure of damages. It was defendant’s duty to prove facts in mitigation of the damage he caused by his breach. If he believed his damages would be lessened by proving that if he had stayed for the remainder of his contract the fifty-percent commission on his gross receipts would have been higher than his guaranteed salary, it was his burden to offer such proof. Though such facts may be difficult to prove, one who breaches his contract “ ‘cannot wholly escape on account of the difficulty which his own wrong has produced of devising a perfect measure of,’ or method of proving, damages.”</p>
<p id="03a76772-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judgment will be reversed with instructions to grant a new trial, limited to the issue of damages.</p>

<li class=""><p id="03a76777-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Use of market value measure of damages.</i> In computing damages for a seller’s wrongful refusal to convey land, the court may employ as a measure of “market value” the higher price that the seller received in selling to another (a sale that would not have been possible, of course, if the seller had not breached his earlier contract with the plaintiff). See Ament v. One Las Olas, Ltd., 898 So. 2d 147 (Fla. 2005) (long-standing precedent establishes that breaching seller should be liable to buyer for any profit made on subsequent sale). This result shifts to the innocent original purchaser the gain that the seller was able to realize as a result of the seller’s breach. In <i>Roth</i>, the court carries that approach over to a case involving breach of an employment contract. Is this appropriate? Or are there factors, not present in the sale-of-land cases, that militate against using this approach to computation of damages in cases like <i>Roth</i>? See also Trilogy Network Systems, Inc. v. Johnson, 172 P.3d 1119 (Ida. 2007) (amount of profit made from breach by employee is relevant to measure of damages if it is shown by evidence to correspond with loss incurred by nonbreaching employer).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03a76778-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The disgorgement principle.</i> Should the measure of damages used in <i>Roth</i> and in the sale-of-land cases be more generally employed, so as to give the plaintiff in most breach-of-contract cases the option of having her damages computed with reference to the gain the defendant was enabled to realize by virtue of his breach? Some commentators have argued that the principle of “disgorgement” traditionally employed in cases of tortious conversion and breach of fiduciary duty should be further extended into the area of breach of <span title="993" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-993">p. 993</span>contract. See Daniel Friedmann, Restitution of Benefits Obtained Through the Appropriation of Property or the Commission of a Wrong, 80 Colum. L. Rev. 504 (1980). (This form of remedy is commonly referred to as a species of “restitution,” although it is clear that this is to some extent a misnomer, since the gain realized by the defendant was not received from the plaintiff.) Professor Friedmann argues that such restitution of gain may be proper in two types of cases: those involving appropriation of some “property” or “quasi-property” interest rightly belonging to the plaintiff and those in which “deterrence” is a major factor.</p>
<p id="03a78d89-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professor Allan Farnworth has taken issue with Friedman’s general conclusions and instead advocates a more cautious approach. He stresses that in many cases it is at least an oversimplification, if not an outright inaccuracy, to say that the defendant’s gain is the “result” of his breach of contract. E. Allan Farnsworth, Your Loss or My Gain? The Dilemma of the Disgorgement Principle in Breach of Contract, 94 Yale L.J. 1339, 1343-1350 (1985). Farnsworth also notes that where there is a functioning market for the goods or services involved, application of market-value remedies will frequently result in effect in disgorgement of substantially all of the breacher’s gain. Id. at 1370-1378. He concludes, however, that a limited extension of the disgorgement principle would be appropriate in cases of what he called “abuse of contract.” He gives as an example a situation in which a builder intentionally substitutes less costly building materials in a structure in breach of the contract saving $25,000. The cost to remedy the defect is $60,000, which many courts would not allow because of “economic waste” (Recall <i>Jacob &amp; Youngs, Inc. v. Kent</i> in Chapter 9) and the decline in market value of the property is $10,000. Farnsworth argues that there is a “strong moral argument” for allowing the owner to recover the builder’s profit of $25,000 to prevent the builder from profiting from his own wrong. In addition, the award of $10,000 has a “significant risk of undercompensation.” Id. at 1384-1386. For a case relying on Professor Farnsworth’s analysis, see Earthinfo, Inc. v. Hydrosphere Resource Consultants, Inc., 900 P.2d 113 (Colo. 1995) (en banc) (in software development contract, defendant’s conscious and intentional breach by refusing to make royalty payments justified plaintiff’s rescission of contract and also disgorgement of profits received by defendant under derivative software contracts; case remanded for apportionment of profits between parties).</p></li>

<p id="03a78d92-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You are an attorney representing a variety of clients involved in different phases of the motion picture and television industries. Not long ago you assisted one of your clients, Robin Green, with the negotiation of a contract for her services next season as a performer in a weekly dramatic television series, “Operating Room,” in which she was to play the continuing featured role of a doctor, for a salary of $30,000 per week, for a minimum of 13 and maximum of 39 weeks of installments. Before that contract was negotiated and signed, Green had performed a featured role in a theatrical motion picture, <i>Frat Men in Space.</i> When <i>Frat Men</i> was subsequently released, it became the surprise hit of the summer season, grossing many millions of dollars for its producers and winning acclaim and attention for all its featured performers, particularly Green. Green has now received informal and indirect word from the producer of an established television comedy series, “Flying High,” that she is being considered to replace one of the three principal players in that series, in the role of an airline pilot. She has been led to believe (and your experience confirms this) that such a role would be compensated at $75,000 or more per weekly episode. However, Green’s fulfillment of her existing contract for “Operating Room” would be inconsistent with a role in “Flying High,” both legally and practically, since either role would require a full-time commitment to filming during the coming television season. Green now asks you whether she can and should pursue the possibility of a role in “Flying High.” Specifically, she asks you what would be the legal consequences if she breached her contract for “Operating Room,” and — in light <span title="995" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-995">p. 995</span>of your conclusions on that point — whether you would advise her to do so, if necessary, in order to obtain the better and more remunerative contract.</p>

She purchased a single family home in the Georgetown area for $1,800,000. She is now ending her assignment in Washington and will be returning to her native country of Brazil. Gabriela entered into a contract to sell her home to Francesco Romano, an Italian economist, who is also coming to the United States to take a position with the World Bank. The price was $1,900,000. The contract called for closing within 90 days. Gabriella’s real estate broker is entitled to a commission of 5 percent ($95,000) payable by Gabriella when and if the sale closes.

Mega was bordered by residential and commercial buildings on all sides. Janet Smith owned two modest-sized apartment buildings near the east side of campus. After negotiations, Janet signed a contract with officials from Mega agreeing to sell the two buildings to Mega for $1 million, with closing in 60 days. When it was announced that the sale was taking place, there was immediate protest from activists about the loss of affordable housing. The activists rallied and protested both on campus and near Janet’s buildings. There were newspaper articles with data showing that the two buildings were worth only $700,000 on the open market. After six weeks, Mega announced that due to the protest, it would not go through with the purchase of Janet’s buildings. Instead, Mega would on the west side of campus buy warehouse space, of comparable size, for $1.2 million that would not lead to the same community protests. Assuming that Mega does not have a valid excuse for nonperformance and Janet sues for money damages, what would be Janet’s measure of recovery?</p>

Tremont would like to bring his family property into the twenty-first century while preserving its historical significance. He has hired Modern but Faithful, Inc.

Under the terms of the contract between Howard and MBF, MBF was required to follow various detailed specifications for the work. When MBF had largely completed the project, with only painting and decoration left to be done, Howard discovered that MBF had used wiring for the farm that did not meet the contract specifications. It appears that the subcontractor hired by MBF used the wrong brand of wiring, although the quality of wiring appears to be equivalent to the contract specifications. MBF was unaware of the subcontractor’s error. Howard has demanded that MBF install wiring that complies with the contract, even if it means tearing open walls to do so. MBF has refused to do this work. Expert testimony would show that the use of the wrong brand of wiring has a <i>de minimis</i> effect on the fair market value of the property; however, the cost to repair the problem would be several hundred thousand dollars.

<li class=""><p id="03a7dbc5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Stephanie Zinn was a law professor with the Southeastern Law School, a for-profit law school created about seven years ago. Two years ago Stephanie received tenure from the Law School, which means that she could be discharged only for good cause or for bona fide reductions in staff due to financial exigencies. In awarding her tenure, the school noted that Stephanie was a recognized expert in data privacy and was working on a book on the subject. Many other professors at the law school publish books and obtain royalties from their publications. Six months ago Southeastern notified <span title="997" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-997">p. 997</span>Stephanie that her employment with the school was being terminated effective at the end of the current school year. The school claims that the termination was proper because it faced financial exigencies due to declining enrollment. However, Stephanie contends that the owners of the school simply wanted to reduce expenses and increase their profits, and this motivation does not satisfy the contractual requirement of a “financial exigency.” Several months after Stephanie received her notice of termination, she received another shock. The publisher of her data privacy book notified her that it was cancelling her contract to publish the book on the ground that she failed to meet one of the requirements for publication — being a tenured professor at an accredited law school. Stephanie tried without success to find another publisher for the book. Assume that Stephanie brings suit against Southeastern for breach of contract and is able to establish that the school breached the contract, will she probably be able to recover damages for lost royalties from her book?</p>

<li class=""><p id="03a7dbca-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider again the situation of law professor Stephanie Zinn in Question 4 above. Assume that prior to her discharge, her annual salary was $150,000 per year. Assume that after Southeastern gave Professor Zinn a notice of discharge, she considered whether to look for another position as a law professor, but she finally decided that the job market was so tight that it was very unlikely that she would obtain another position. She also considered private employment with a law firm, but the only position that she was able to obtain was that of a contract attorney doing document review work. She was told that she could anticipate 1,000 hours of work over the next year at a rate of $30 per hour, total $30,000. Stephanie concluded that accepting such employment would be so damaging to her reputation and future prospects that even though she needed the money, she would not accept employment doing document review work. She does have some savings and family support that enable her to get by for a while and fortunately she also has a good friend/lawyer who will handle her lawsuit against Southeastern without charge except for court-awarded fees. Several months after filing suit, her lawyer tells her that the Southeastern has offered to reinstate her at a salary of $75,000 per year. Stephanie rejects the offer saying, “I will never work for those people again.” Assume that Stephanie is able to establish that they breached her employment contract — what would be the measure <span title="998" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-998">p. 998</span>of her damages for the first year of breach?

The E85, as the name of the company indicates, is pricey, starting at $150,000. Nathan Orsinski, a car enthusiast, places an order for a new E85 on the first day that the car is offered for sale. With various options and add-ons, Orsinski’s contract price is $175,000. EM tells Orsinski that because the car is in such high demand, EM has a back order of vehicles for more than a year. Six months after placing his order, Orsinski receives a notice from EM that his order is being cancelled because of “supply difficulties.” Orsinski has learned, however, that EM has delivered the E85 to some “favored buyers” in the area. Orsinski searches in vain to find an E85 available for sale. Assume that Orsinski brings suit against EM for specific performance, or in the alternative, damages.

This year their youngest child Sofia was married and moved to live with her husband in Atlanta. Being “empty nesters,” the Sanchezes decided that it was time to move to a much smaller house. Over the next few months they began cleaning out the tangible results of their more than three decades in their current home. In the process of doing so they discovered a treasure trove of old family photographs and papers going back at least 100 years. They decided that they wanted to preserve this material for their children and future generations. After talking with friends, seeking advice from local librarians, and conducting Internet searches, they decided to hire Family Preservation Specialists (FPS), a company that focuses on preservation of materials like the ones found by the Sanchezes. They paid a fee of $7,500 to turn all of the material into digital form, to make it searchable, and to preserve the physical copies in the most protective way. However, to their great sadness, the Sanchezes received a call about two months later from FPS reporting to its great regret that due to a flash flood at its headquarters, all of the Sanchezes’ property had been destroyed. At first the Sanchezes were saddened by the news, but their sadness turned to anger as they learned more about the flash flood and FPS’s failure to institute reasonable precautions to protect the irreplaceable property FPS had received. Suppose the Sanchezes have brought suit against FPS for breach of contract, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligence including negligent infliction of emotional distress because of FPS’s failure to preserve their irreplaceable family material. Assume that the Sanchezes are able to establish that FPS breached its contract with them and that FPS was also negligent (but that it did not act intentionally and was not grossly negligent) in failing to preserve and protect their material. Which of the following is the most accurate statement about the remedy available to the Sanchezes?</p>

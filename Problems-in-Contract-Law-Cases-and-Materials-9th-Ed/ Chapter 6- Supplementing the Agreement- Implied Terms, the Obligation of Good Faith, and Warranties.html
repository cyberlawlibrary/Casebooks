<p id="03697401-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Up to this point, we have generally concentrated on the problem of discovering and applying the agreement of the parties. As Chapter 5 demonstrated, the parties’ true “agreement” may involve more than their formal written expressions of agreement; it may be found as well in their informal writings and in their conversations, or even in their actions. And all of these may be interpreted in the light of the parties’ own dealings, past and present, and of the customs and mores of the community in which they were acting. In this chapter we widen our field of vision still further, to take in the possibility that the “contract” (meaning, here, a set of legal obligations) that the court enforces in a given case will include not merely those terms on which the parties have thus “agreed,” but also other terms, which the court finds to be “implied” in that agreement.</p>
</div>
<div id="03697402-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" level="A" class="epub-section epub-ahead cc-section"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-xlarge left"><h2><p class="cc-wrapper" id="03697403-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56">A.&nbsp;THE RATIONALE FOR IMPLIED TERMS</p></h2></div>


<p id="03697404-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The phrase <i>implied term</i> is itself ambiguous, of course. In one sense, any term that the court finds to be “implicit” in the parties’ words or conduct even though not literally expressed by them is an implied term — implied, in fact, by the parties themselves. In this chapter, we will be using the notion of an implied term to refer also to a term that the court does not find in the parties’ agreement, even as broadly viewed, but that the court holds should be “implied by law” — made a part of that agreement by operation of the rules of law rather than by the agreement of the parties themselves. Sometimes a term will be implied (in this latter sense) because a statute so provides; sometimes because common law precedents dictate, or because the court concludes that in the particular case its implication is appropriate.</p>
<p id="03697405-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="482" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-482">p. 482</span>By the time our survey of this area has been completed, you may well conclude that the borderline between terms that are implied-in-fact (i.e., agreed to in some meaningful sense by the parties themselves) and implied-in-law (imposed by the court) is not an easy one to draw. Certainly one of the reasons militating in favor of an implied-by-law term may be its apparent consistency with the intention of the parties, as evinced by those terms to which they did agree. Nevertheless, the process of implication is somewhat more complicated than this, and the goals this area of contract law may serve are more varied than merely an effectuating of the parties’ own intent, as the following materials will demonstrate.</p>

<p id="0369740b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appeal from a judgment entered April 24, 1917, upon an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court . . . which reversed an order of Special Term denying a motion by defendant for judgment in her favor upon the pleadings and granted said motion. . . . </p>

<p id="03699b1d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant styles herself “a creator of fashions.” Her favor helps a sale. Manufacturers of dresses, millinery and like articles are glad to pay for a certificate of her approval. The things which she designs, fabrics, parasols and what not, have a new value in the public mind when issued in her name. She employed the plaintiff to help her to turn this vogue into money. He was to have the exclusive right, subject always to her approval, to place her indorsements on the designs of others. He was also to have the exclusive right to place her own designs on sale, or to license others to market them. In return, she was to have one-half of “all profits and revenues” derived from any contracts he might make. The exclusive right was to last at least one year from April 1, 1915, and thereafter from year to year unless terminated by notice of ninety days. The plaintiff says that he kept the contract on his part, and that the defendant broke it. She placed her indorsement on fabrics, dresses and millinery without his knowledge, and withheld the profits. He sues her for the damages, and the case comes here on demurrer.</p>

<p></p>

<p id="03699b21-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The agreement of employment is signed by both parties. It has a wealth of recitals. The defendant insists, however, that it lacks the <span title="483" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-483">p. 483</span>elements of a contract. She says that the plaintiff does not bind himself to anything. It is true that he does not promise in so many words that he will use reasonable efforts to place the defendant’s indorsements and market her designs. We think, however, that such a promise is fairly to be implied. The law has outgrown its primitive stage of formalism when the precise word was the sovereign talisman, and every slip was fatal. It takes a broader view today. A promise may be lacking, and yet the whole writing may be “instinct with an obligation,” imperfectly expressed (Scott, J., in McCall Co. v. Wright, 133 App. Div. 62; Moran v. Standard Oil Co., 211 N.Y. 187, 198). If that is so, there is a contract.</p>
<p id="03699b22-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The implication of a promise here finds support in many circumstances. The defendant gave an <i>exclusive</i> privilege. She was to have no right for at least a year to place her own indorsements or market her own designs except through the agency of the plaintiff. The acceptance of the exclusive agency was an assumption of its duties (Phoenix Hermetic Co. v. Filtrine Mfg. Co., 164 App. Div. 424; W.G. Taylor Co. v. Bannerman, 120 Wis. 189; Mueller v. Bethesda Mineral Spring Co., 88 Mich. 390). We are not to suppose that one party was to be placed at the mercy of the other (Hearn v. Stevens &amp; Bro., 111 App. Div. 101, 106; Russell v. Allerton, 108 N.Y. 288). Many other terms of the agreement point the same way. We are told at the outset by way of recital that “the said Otis F. Wood possesses a business organization adapted to the placing of such indorsements as the said Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon has approved.”</p>
<p id="03699b23-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The implication is that the plaintiff’s business organization will be used for the purpose for which it is adapted. But the terms of the defendant’s compensation are even more significant. Her sole compensation for the grant of an exclusive agency is to be one-half of all the profits resulting from the plaintiff’s efforts. Unless he gave his efforts, she could never get anything. Without an implied promise, the transaction cannot have such business “efficacy as both parties must have intended that at all events it should have” (Bowen, L.J., in The Moorcock, 14 P.D. 64, 68). But the contract does not stop there. The plaintiff goes on to promise that he will account monthly for all moneys received by him, and that he will take out all such patents and copyrights and trademarks as may in his judgment be necessary to protect the rights and articles affected by the agreement. It is true, of course, as the Appellate Division has said, that if he was under no duty to try to market designs or to place certificates of indorsement, his promise to account for profits or take out copyrights would be valueless. But in determining the intention of the parties, the promise <i>has</i> a value. It helps to enforce the conclusion that the plaintiff <i>had</i> some duties. His promise to pay the defendant one-half of the profits and revenues resulting from the exclusive agency and to render accounts monthly, was a promise to use reasonable efforts to bring profits and revenues into existence. For this conclusion, the authorities are ample. . . . </p>

<li class=""><p id="0369c139-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Factual context.</i> The historical and economic context of the <i>Wood</i> case is discussed by Professor Walter F. Pratt, Jr., in his article, American Contract Law at the Turn of the Century, 39 S.C. L. Rev. 415 (1988). Professor Pratt explains that Lady Duff-Gordon rose from a meager start in business to become one of the preeminent designers of her time and that she breached her exclusive marketing contract with Wood by directly entering into a very “innovative” arrangement to sell her designer dresses through the Sears, Roebuck and Company mail order catalogue. Id. at 429-430, 438-439. Professor Pratt identifies a number of other imaginative business measures taken by Lady Duff-Gordon and observes that she is also remembered for having survived the sinking of the Titanic. Id. at 419 n.14, 429-432. In 2007, in honor of the 90th anniversary of the decision, Pace University held a symposium on the case. See Symposium, The Enduring Legacy of Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon, 28 Pace U. L. Rev. 162 (2008).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0369c13a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Implied terms and illusory promises.</i> In the course of his opinion for the court in <i>Wood</i>, Judge Cardozo declares that the implication of a promise on Wood’s part is necessary to give the parties’ agreement “business efficacy.” “We are not to suppose,” he declares, “that one party was to be placed at the mercy of the other.” Do you agree? Is it conceivable that Lady Duff-Gordon might have regarded even an agreement that did <i>not</i> impose such obligations on Wood as having sufficient “business efficacy” from her point of view to make it worth entering into? Suppose the agreement between them had generally been as described in the above case, but that it had in addition expressly provided that while Wood was free to make efforts on her behalf (from which, if successful, he and she would both profit), he was not <i>obligated</i> to do so. Would such an agreement have been enforceable by Lady Duff-Gordon? By Wood? In an article discussing generally the requirement of consideration, Professor Melvin Eisenberg takes the position that agreements in which one party makes only a nonbinding, “illusory” promise frequently reflect a rational bargain and ought to be enforceable according to their terms. The party making the <i>non</i>illusory promise, he asserts, has in effect bargained for a “chance”: the chance to show that his performance is attractive. (As an analogy, Eisenberg cites the “money-back” guarantee, by which the seller demonstrates his own confidence in his product by promising to refund the buyer’s money if she is not satisfied for any reason. See UCC §2-326, defining the “sale on approval.”) Melvin A. Eisenberg, The Principles of Consideration, 67 Cornell L. Rev. 640, 649-651 (1982).</p>
<p id="0369c13b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recent decisions continue to follow the principle recognized in <i>Wood</i> that an implied obligation to use reasonable efforts will prevent a somewhat indefinite promise from being illusory. See TMG Kreations, LLC v. Seltzer, 771 F.3d 1006 (7th Cir. 2014) (citing <i>Wood</i> as accepted, uniform law that exclusive distributorship contract includes implied promise to use best efforts); A.J. Amer Agency, Inc. v. Astonish Results, LLC, 2014 WL 3496964 (D.R.I.) (describing holding in <i>Wood</i> on implied terms as “iconic”).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0369c13c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>When should a promise to use “reasonable” or “best efforts” be implied?</i> In <i>Wood</i>, the defendant claimed that although their agreement obligated her to <span title="485" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-485">p. 485</span>market her designs only through Wood, it left him apparently free to do nothing on her behalf, while at the same time representing whomever else he pleased. Such an arrangement would have lacked “business efficacy,” according to Judge Cardozo, because it would have effectively placed one party (Lucy) at the mercy of another (Wood), and therefore the court implied a duty on Wood’s part to use reasonable efforts on Lucy’s behalf. The <i>Wood</i> case is generally regarded as the genesis of the provision in UCC §2-306(2) that imposes a “best efforts” obligation in cases where the contract for sale calls for “exclusive dealing.” See MDC Corp. v. John H. Harland Co., 228 F. Supp. 2d 387, 393 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). Cases under the Code have explored the extent to which an arrangement must be “exclusive” to trigger the best efforts obligation of §2-306(2). In <i>MDC</i>, the contract permitted a requirements seller to maintain certain other existing relationships with particular customers; the parties’ relationship was nevertheless held to be sufficiently “exclusive” to obligate the requirements buyer to use its best efforts to generate a market for the seller’s goods. MDC Corp, 228 F. Supp. 2d at 394; see also Tigg Corp. v. Dow Corning Corp., 962 F.2d 1119, 1125 (3d Cir. 1992) (contract permitting supplier to sell to others if buyer failed to buy stated minimum amounts nevertheless held to be “exclusive dealing arrangement” invoking UCC §2-306(2); once minimum was reached seller could sell only to buyer under their contract). Other aspects of the law’s treatment of requirements contracts are discussed in the Comment that follows Seidenberg v. Summit Bank in the next section of this chapter.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0369c13d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Assessing best or reasonable efforts.</i> Suppose that the plaintiff in this case had instead been Lady Duff-Gordon, asserting that defendant Wood should respond in damages because allegedly he had failed to use reasonable efforts to promote the sale of her designs and endorsements. In that case, would the implied obligation assumed by Wood under their agreement have been sufficient to enable her complaint to survive defendant Wood’s demurrer? If so, what obstacle would she still have faced before achieving her goal of recovering a judgment?</p>
<p id="0369c13e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Parties frequently define an express obligation in terms of “best efforts” or “reasonable efforts.” The court in <i>Wood</i> found an implied promise to use “reasonable efforts,” while UCC §2-306(2) implies a duty to use “best efforts.” Do the two different wordings suggest different levels of obligation? Courts have adopted widely differing approaches to the meaning of “best efforts” clauses. A minority of courts refuse to enforce such clauses on the ground of vagueness; some courts treat the clauses as the equivalent of “good faith”; for others the clauses impose fiduciary obligations on the performing party. See Zachary Miller, Comment, Best Efforts?: Differing Judicial Interpretations of a Familiar Term, 48 Ariz. L. Rev. 615 (2006). Most courts, however, seem to define “best efforts” in terms of reasonableness or diligence. See Samica Enterprises, LLC v. Mail Boxes Etc. USA, Inc., 637 F. Supp. 2d 712 (C.D. Cal. 2008) (under California law “best efforts” requires a party to make such efforts as are reasonable based on the abilities of the party, the means available to it, and the expectations of the other party); Maestro West Chelsea SPE LLC v. Pradera Realty Inc., 954 N.Y.S.2d 819 (Sup. Ct. 2012) (duty of best efforts <span title="486" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-486">p. 486</span>imposes obligation to act in good faith in light of one’s capabilities and to pursue all reasonable methods, usually a question of fact); E. Allan Farnsworth, On Trying to Keep One’s Promises: The Duty of Best Efforts in Contract Law, 46 U. Pitt. L. Rev. 1, 8 (1984) (distinguishing good faith, which has honesty and fairness at its core, and best efforts, a more exacting standard, the essence of which is diligence).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0369c13f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Implied-in-fact or implied-in-law?</i> Would you characterize the promise to use reasonable efforts in <i>Wood</i> as implied-in-law or implied-in-fact? Both? Does it make any difference? Cf. Alta Vista Properties, LLC v. Mauer Vision Ctr., PC, 855 N.W.2d 722 (Iowa 2014) (holding that explicit right of landlord to sell property during lease would also require implied right to show property at reasonable times to prospective purchasers, based on express terms and applicable legal principles). The connection between implication from facts and implication by law is further illustrated by the following cases.</p></li>

<p id="0369e857-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The essential facts are that the parties entered into an oral agreement whereby appellant was to have an exclusive dealer-distributorship for appellee’s garage doors in a territory extending for a 50-mile radius from Lexington, Kentucky. The agreement was entered into on or about March 1, 1974. The appellee agreed to sell and deliver to the appellant its garage doors, operators and parts at the factory distributor price, and the appellant agreed to sell, install and service Raynor products exclusively, thereby establishing a relationship of dealer-distributor and manufacturer-supplier. There is no real dispute concerning the nature of the relationship.</p>
<p id="0369e858-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a result of the agreement, the appellant borrowed substantial sums of money in order to make certain capital expenditures, purchase an inventory, and to provide working capital for starting the business, including the rental of storage and office space, employment of personnel, and the purchase of a service truck, tools and equipment.</p>

<p id="0369e85c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We disagree with the conclusions of the trial court and hold that reasonable notification is required in order to terminate an on-going oral agreement for the sale of goods in a relationship of manufacturer-supplier and dealer-distributor or franchisee. The summary judgment must therefore be set aside and a determination must be made on the factual issue of whether or not the notification of termination given in this case was reasonable under the circumstances.</p>
<p id="0369e85d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant argues that this contract is now controlled by Article II of the Uniform Commercial Code. The opinion of the trial court provided only that, “It is the opinion of the court that the Uniform Commercial Code applies to the sale of goods and is not intended to apply to the type of situation we have in this case.” The rule for application of Article II in Kentucky was stated in Buttorff v. United Electronic Laboratories, Inc., Ky., 459 S.W.2d 581 (1970). According to the opinion in <i>Buttorff,</i> supra, we are to look to the real nature of the agreement, the real purpose, and what the parties really intended. It appears that the case sub judice can be distinguished from <i>Buttorff,</i> supra, on its facts. The relationship in <i>Buttorff,</i> supra, was found to be a contract for personal services, not for the sale of goods or merchandise. Buttorff was actually a commissioned salesman for United Electronics Laboratories’ cameras and related equipment.</p>
<p id="0369e85e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We must now consider the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code in order to determine whether or not the article on sales is applicable to the situation at bar. This question has not yet been decided by a Kentucky court.</p>
<p id="0369e85f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Article II of the Uniform Commercial Code applies to transactions involving goods and merchandise. “A contract between an automobile manufacturer and an automobile dealer is a contract of sale since it is apparent that its over all purpose and object is to effect the sale of the automobiles manufactured by the manufacturer, and the fact that it may speak in terms of franchises does not change its true character.” 1 Anderson, UCC §2-101:5, p. 201 (2d ed.) “When a manufacturer sells its product to the public through a local dealer, the transaction is a sale, and the application of the Code is not avoided by describing the relationship as a ‘sales distribution’ plan.” Id., at 202. In relation to the same section of the Code, Anderson also cites a Pennsylvania case which held that, “A dealership contract for the sale of automobile parts is a contract for the sale of goods, even though the contract declares that it is a personal service contract.” Cum. Supp., Anderson, UCC, p. 174 (2d ed.) Anderson also cites a California case holding that, “Where a supplier of milk agreed with a distributor that the latter would resell milk purchased from the supplier to wholesalers, the relationship between the supplier and the distributor was a sale of goods, and not a contract for services.” Id.</p>
<p id="0369e860-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the case at bar, we have a clear situation where the dealer-distributor was to sell the “goods” of the manufacturer-supplier. Appellant was not a commissioned salesman, and the agreement appears to be for the sale of goods.</p>
<p id="0369e861-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="488" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-488">p. 488</span>We conclude that the time has come to recognize that a distributorship agreement must be recognized as an agreement for the sale of goods and subject to the provisions of Article II of the Uniform Commercial Code, which has been adopted by Kentucky in Chapter 355 of the Kentucky Revised Statutes. The amount of money being invested pursuant to distributorship agreements is ever increasing. Often there are no formal written agreements, and it may be that the manufacturer’s policy is to have no written agreements. By not establishing a length of time for the contract to exist, either party may terminate the relationship at will, but without a requirement for good faith and fair play, either party may be severely damaged. When sales are the primary essence of the distributorship agreement, the dealer is compelled to keep a large inventory on hand. If the distributorship is terminated without allowing the dealer sufficient time to sell his remaining inventory, substantial damages may result, even if the manufacturer agrees to repurchase the inventory. Reasonable notification should be the minimum amount of protection afforded to either party upon the termination of an ongoing sales agreement. When such reasonable notice is not given, a cause of action for damages may exist.</p>
<p id="0369e862-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having concluded that the Code is applicable to the relationship between the appellant and appellee, we must look at the specific requirements of KRS 355.2-309, “Absence of Specific Time Provisions — Notice of Termination.” Subsection (2) reads, “Where the contract provides for successive performances, but is indefinite in duration, it is valid for a reasonable time but unless otherwise agreed may be terminated at any time by either party.” Subsection (3) goes on to provide, “Termination of a contract by one (1) party except on the happening of an agreed event requires that reasonable notification be received by the other party and an agreement dispensing with notification is invalid if its operation would be unconscionable.” There can be no doubt that reasonable notice is now required. . . . Today, in Kentucky, if the provisions of Article II of the Uniform Commercial Code apply to the relationship, reasonable notice of the intention to terminate the agreement must be given. In some cases, it would be required even if a written agreement provided for dispensing with notification. We therefore find additional error in the trial court’s opinion when it concluded that even if the provisions of the Code were applicable, only actual notice of termination would be required.</p>

McGinnis Piano and Organ Co. v. Yamaha International Corporation, 480 F.2d 474 (8th Cir. 1973) is cited for the proposition that “in some states, it is implied that a dealership contract which may be terminated upon notice must be allowed to continue for a sufficient period to enable the franchisee to recoup his investment.” The case of O.M. Droney Beverage Co. v. Miller Brewing Co., 365 F. Supp. 1067 (D. Minn. 1973), is cited for the proposition that “under Minnesota law ‘a reasonable duration will be implied in franchise agreements where a dealer has made substantial investments in reliance on the agreement.’ ”</p>
<p id="0369e867-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The distributorship agreement existing between appellant and appellee is one in which the essence was the sale of goods. Appellant was certainly not an employee or commissioned salesman of appellee. Appellant purchased the products of the appellee at wholesale prices, and marketed them in the Lexington area. The appellant does not dispute the fact that the agreement was terminable at will, but he contends, and the law so holds, that the appellee was required to give reasonable notification of intent to terminate the contract. What length of time constitutes reasonable notice is a question of material fact which remains to be decided. We cannot say that the written notice given in this case was “reasonable” as a matter of law.</p>

<li class=""><p id="036a0f7c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>“Gap-Filling” provisions of UCC Article 2.</i> Article 2 of the Code provides many terms — like those stated in §2-309 — that will as a matter of law be implied in contracts for the sale of goods unless otherwise agreed by the parties. (Other examples are UCC §§2-308 (place of delivery), 2-310 (time of payment), 2-509 (risk of loss), and 2-513 (buyer’s right of inspection).) Rules of law that supply implied terms for the parties may be supported on the basis that the terms they provide are “fair” or “just.” Indeed, some of the implied-by-law obligations imposed by the UCC are mandatory and may not be varied even if the parties expressly agree otherwise. (See, e.g., UCC §§2-309(3), 2-719(3); see generally UCC §1-302.) For the most part, however, such rules are regarded merely as “gap-fillers,” subject to preemption by the parties’ express agreement. (Sometimes the form of an agreement varying the Code rule is itself prescribed by a Code provision; see, e.g., UCC §2-316, regulating disclaimers of implied warranties.)</p>
<p id="036a0f7d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Code’s system of implied terms can be justified not only on grounds of fairness, but also because such terms represent the probable intention of the parties if they had bargained over the particular issue. Under this rationale, <span title="490" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-490">p. 490</span>implied terms are validated on the ground of economic efficiency: If the terms that the law would supply are indeed those most parties would voluntarily choose for themselves, then the process of agreement-making will in general be less costly because contracting parties will have fewer terms to bargain out. We have seen that parties may employ standardized forms for this reason; implied terms that are standardized by law can serve the same purpose. “Off-the-rack” terms, like ready-made suits, are less costly than custom-tailored ones. See Selcke v. New England Ins. Co., 995 F.2d 688, 690 (7th Cir. 1993) (noting that the law could require that parties specify every right or duty, “but then contracts would be very long”). Additionally, it would be extremely inefficient for parties to bargain over terms to address situations that are not likely to occur. David Charny, Hypothetical Bargains: The Normative Structure of Contract Interpretation, 89 Mich. L. Rev. 1815 (1991).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="036a0f7e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Implied terms as default rules.</i> The general approach of the courts has been to devise implied terms, often called “default rules,” that reflect a “hypothetical bargain,” the agreement that the parties probably would have made had they bargained over the issue. Lisa Bernstein, Social Norms and Default Rules Analysis, 3 S. Cal. Interdisc. L.J. 59, 62-63 (1993). Many writers have suggested other bases for supplying default rules. Some observers assert that default rules should be premised on relational aspects of repeated or long-term transactions between the same parties. See, e.g., Jay M. Feinman, Relational Contract and Default Rules, 3 S. Cal. Interdisc. L.J. 43 (1993). Professors Ayres and Gertner argue that in determining the proper default rule it is important to understand the reason for contractual incompleteness. Some contracts are incomplete because one of the parties has more information than the other and engages in strategic behavior. In such cases, Ayres and Gertner argue that efficiency-minded courts should consider adopting what they refer to as “penalty default rules,” ones that penalize parties for strategic behavior and thereby create incentives for knowledgeable parties to reveal information in the course of bargaining with the other side. Ian Ayres &amp; Robert Gertner, Filling Gaps in Incomplete Contracts: An Economic Theory of Default Rules, 99 Yale L.J. 87, 94 (1989).</p>
<p id="036a0f7f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In light of the <i>Leibel</i> decision and the foregoing discussion, consider what the appropriate repayment terms should be for a loan made without an agreed due date. See Barnes v. Michalski, 925 N.E.2d 323 (Ill. App. Ct. 2010) (apparent majority view is that loan without repayment terms is due in reasonable time, relying partly on the Restatement (Second) §204 provision on supplying an omitted term).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="036a0f80-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Enforcing distributorship agreements. </i> The enforceability of exclusive distributorship agreements was problematic under the common law. If the agreement failed to impose definite obligations on the dealer, or if it was of indefinite duration (so that either party was free to terminate the agreement at any time), the agreement could be held unenforceable for lack of consideration or lack of mutuality of obligation. A classic example is Du Pont v. Claiborne-Reno Co., 64 F.2d 224 (8th Cir. 1933). Although Reno served from 1924 to 1930 as <span title="491" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-491">p. 491</span>the exclusive distributor in Iowa of certain Du Pont products, the contract did not expressly provide that Reno was committed for a specific period of time. Applying the same presumption used in employment contracts of indefinite duration, the court deemed Reno free to terminate at will. Moreover, because Reno was deemed not bound, the court held that the contract could not be enforced against Du Pont. Id. at 232-233.</p>
<p id="036a0f81-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As <i>Leibel</i> demonstrates, distributorship agreements today are likely to fall within the general scope of Article 2, as “transactions in goods.” If so, the implied obligations found in UCC §§2-306 and 2-309 should eliminate most problems of lack of consideration or lack of mutuality. E.g., Thermal Systems of Alabama, Inc. v. Sigafoose, 533 So. 2d 567 (Ala. 1988) (rejecting arguments of lack of mutuality and indefiniteness against enforceability of a distributorship agreement, based on UCC §§2-306 and 2-309). A distributorship contract of indefinite duration, however, will still be subject to termination at-will upon reasonable notice. See, e.g., Fitzpatrick v. Teleflex, Inc., 763 F. Supp. 2d 224 (D. Maine 2011) (applying Maine law).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="036a0f82-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Assessing reasonable notice.</i> Discussing whether Raynor had given Leibel “reasonable notification” of its intention to terminate their arrangement, the <i>Leibel</i> opinion refers to some possibly relevant factors: the distributor’s need to sell off its remaining inventory and the question whether it still has substantial unrecouped investment made in reliance on the agreement. See, e.g., Sofa Gallery, Inc. v. Stratford Co., 872 F.2d 259 (8th Cir. 1989) (reasonable notice of termination without cause takes into account time needed to recoup reasonable initial or continuing investment, close out product line, and minimize losses). Some courts have made a distinction between cases involving an investment by a distributor and those without startup or similar costs. See Italian &amp; French Wine Co. v. Negociants USA, Inc. 842 F. Supp. 693 (W.D.N.Y. 1993) (distributorship agreements without an investment may be merely a type of employment or personal services contract that is properly terminable at will). Comment 8 to UCC §2-309 refers to a related factor: whether there has been sufficient or “reasonable time” to find a “substitute arrangement.”</p>
<p id="036a0f83-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The determination whether notice is reasonable may also be affected by the terms contained in the parties’ present or prior agreement and by industry standards. See Retail Associates, Inc. v. Macy’s East, Inc., 245 F.3d 694 (8th Cir. 2001) (90 days’ notice for termination of consignment contract to place maternity clothes in department stores was reasonable given that consignor had virtually no capital investment, that inventory would turn over in six-month seasons, and that consignor had other outlets to sell any remaining inventory).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="036a0f84-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Effect of express termination provisions.</i> Unlike <i>Leibel</i>, most modern commercial contracts will specify events of termination. Suppose Leibel and Raynor had entered into a written agreement that provided for immediate termination on written notice by Raynor. What result? Suppose the written agreement provided that Raynor could terminate the agreement on written notice to Leibel if its sales declined for two consecutive years.

Co., 908 F.2d 7 (5th Cir. 1990) (distributorship contract that specified various grounds for termination, including minimum sales provision, was not thereby terminable only on the occurrence of one of those agreed-upon events; instead, contract was for indefinite duration, terminable either on reasonable notice under UCC §2-309(3) or on happening of one of agreed events), with Viking Supply v. National Cart Co., Inc., 310 F.3d 1092 (8th Cir. 2002) (agreement that provided for termination by manufacturer of shopping cart corrals if distributor lost key sales contract with Target stores was not at-will and was terminable upon the occurrence of the specified event).</p></li>

<p id="036a0f87-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We saw in Chapter 2 that occasionally parties will be held to a duty to bargain in good faith when negotiating toward a contract. Once a contract has been concluded, however, the authorities are unanimous in declaring that its terms will be deemed to include an obligation of good faith that is binding on both parties. The Uniform Commercial Code declares in §1-304 (formerly §1-203) that “every contract or duty” within its scope “imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance and enforcement.” Restatement (Second) §205 echoes the above UCC provision, extending the “duty of good faith and fair dealing” to “every contract.” To say that generally an obligation of good faith will be implied does not, of course, answer the harder question of what that obligation requires of each party in the context of their particular agreement.</p>
<p id="036a0f88-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The UCC meaning of good faith.</i> The UCC provides in Article 1 (revised 2001) that good faith “means honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.” See UCC §1-201(b)(20). With the exception of a narrower provision in Article 5, the UCC would now generally apply to all parties (both merchant and nonmerchant) the complementary concepts of “subjective honesty” and “objective reasonableness” in determining good faith. See Official Comment to UCC §1-201(b)(20). Revised Article 1 has now been adopted in a clear majority of states, but not all jurisdictions have acquiesced in its expanded definition of “good faith.” While most states have adopted the revised, single definition, a number of states have chosen to retain the more minimal standard of “honesty in fact,” at least for parties who are not Article 2 merchants.</p>
<p id="036a0f89-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The “fruit of the contract” concept of good faith.</i> In a 1933 decision, the New York Court of Appeals declared,</p>

<p id="036a0f8a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In every contract there is an implied covenant that neither party shall do anything which will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party to receive the fruits of the contract, which means that in every contract there is an implied obligation of good faith and fair dealing.</p>

E.g., Dick Broad. Co., Inc. of Tennessee v. Oak Ridge FM, Inc., 395 S.W.3d 653 (Tenn. 2013) (noting accepted principle in American courts that every contract includes the implied covenant of good faith to protect receipt of the fruits of the contract).</p>
<p id="036a0f8c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A number of commentators have also pursued this “fruits of the contract” approach. Thus, Professor Steven Burton has suggested that bad faith consists of attempts by one party to recapture “forgone opportunities” — occasions for the realization of gain that (in light of any applicable business practices or the course of dealing between the parties) he should have understood to be precluded by the contract at issue. Steven J. Burton, Breach of Contract and the Common Law Duty to Perform in Good Faith, 94 Harv. L. Rev. 369 (1980); Steven J. Burton &amp; Eric G. Andersen, Contractual Good Faith (1995). See also Dennis M. Patterson, Good Faith and Lender Liability 7 (1990) (arguing that good faith should be seen as protecting the “reasonable expectations” of the contracting parties considered in light of the background practices and customs in which the agreement arose).</p>
<p id="036a0f8d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Judicial application of the doctrine of “good faith.”</i> Professor Michael Van Alstine reported that beginning in the 1990s courts moved toward “a new textualist approach,” giving a near absolute priority to express terms and rendering the implied duty of good faith irrelevant in many situations. Michael P. Van Alstine, Of Textualism, Party Autonomy, and Good Faith, 40 Wm. &amp; Mary L. Rev. 1223 (1999). Professor Van Alstine’s study gives evidence that while nearly all courts recognize the implied duty of good faith, at least in principle, not all will give that concept a broad application. See Max N. Helveston, Judicial Deregulation of Consumer Markets, 36 Cardozo L. Rev. 1739 (2015); Emily M.S. Houh, The Doctrine of Good Faith in Contract Law: A (Nearly) Empty Vessel? 2005 Utah L. Rev. 1 (2005).</p>
<p id="036a0f8e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Perhaps reflecting this more recent tendency to approach “good faith” with caution, the drafters of the revised UCC Article 1 have stated in the Comment to revised §1-304 that the “section does not support an independent cause of action for failure to perform or enforce in good faith. . . . [T]he doctrine of good faith merely directs a court towards interpreting contracts within the commercial context in which they are created, performed, and enforced, and does not create a separate duty of fairness and reasonableness which can be independently breached.”</p>
<p id="036a0f8f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In one way or another, most courts and writers who have spoken of an obligation of good faith do appear at least to share the view that this concept should be employed in cases where one party’s actions were such as to undermine the “spirit” of the contract — either by enabling that party to realize gains that in making that contract he had implicitly agreed to surrender, or by unfairly denying to the other party the fruits of the contract that she reasonably expected to receive. The following cases illustrate the process by which the abstract obligation of good faith may be given concrete application.<span title="494" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-494">p. 494</span></p>

<p id="036a36b0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the second amended complaint, plaintiffs contend, among other things, that Summit (a) failed to allow for the creation of a close working relationship between the entities, (b) failed to create an effective cross-selling structure to <span title="495" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-495">p. 495</span>generate leads, (c) failed to introduce the brokerage firms to vendors doing business with Summit as a way of increasing their potential customer base, (d) failed to develop existing relationships (referred to in the pleadings as “low hanging fruit”) which could easily be picked and turned into clients for the brokerage firms, (e) failed to provide plaintiffs with information necessary to provide full advice concerning health and other employee benefits, thereby precluding plaintiffs from quoting coverage to Summit, (f) unreasonably delayed a direct mail campaign, (g) thwarted an agreed-upon joint marketing campaign, and (h) failed to advise of Summit’s pursuit of the acquisition of another entity which plaintiffs claim would fall within their ambit and right to operate.</p>
<p id="036a36b1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs claimed that Summit’s lack of performance in these areas impacted their reasonable expectations of compensation and future involvement. For example, plaintiffs’ salaries were reduced in exchange for a bonus to which they would be entitled based on the growth of the brokerage firms. They claim this was agreeable due to the anticipation of a substantial bonus upon the growth of the business. Accordingly, the allegations contained in the second amended complaint, briefly outlined above, are linked to plaintiffs’ compensation. In addition, plaintiffs claim there was an expectation of continued employment since their employment agreements contained a minimum term of five years and provided also that, in the absence of termination by Summit, employment would continue until each reached the age of 70.</p>
<p id="036a36b2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs assert that these allegations give rise to an inference of bad faith. They claim that these circumstances demonstrate that Summit “never had any intention to perform to begin with,” and that Summit “from the start, . . . never [was] committed to developing the business with [plaintiffs], but rather simply wanted to acquire the business and seek out their own broker to run it or grow it.” In December 1999, Summit terminated plaintiffs from their positions, triggering this lawsuit.</p>

After the joinder of issue, the parties reached a partial settlement of their disputes and, on July 25, 2000, a consent order was entered which eliminated all claims except plaintiffs’ claim of a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. With the resolution of the equity claims, the Chancery judge, as was his prerogative, transferred the matter to the Law Division.

<p id="036a5dcb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We start with the premise that in New Jersey the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is contained in all contracts and mandates that “neither party shall do anything which will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party to receive the fruits of the contract.” Sons of Thunder v. Borden, Inc., 148 N.J. 396, 420, 690 A.2d 575 (1997); Palisades Properties, Inc. v. Brunetti, 44 N.J. 117, 130, 207 A.2d 522 (1965). While this general statement represents the guiding principle in such matters, determining whether the present action may be maintained requires closer examination.</p>
<p id="036a5dcc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing has evolved to the point where it permits the adjustment of the obligations of contracting parties in a number of different ways. Some cases have focused on a plaintiff’s inadequate bargaining power or financial vulnerability in order to avoid an inequitable result otherwise permitted by a contract’s express terms. See e.g., <i>Sons of Thunder.</i> Other decisions have revolved around the expectations of the parties, generating a need to contrast those expectations with the absence of any express terms. See e.g., Onderdonk v. Presbyterian Homes, 85 N.J. 171, 425 A.2d 1057 (1981). And still others have emphasized the defendant’s bad faith or outright dishonesty. See e.g., Pickett v. Lloyd’s, 131 N.J. 457, 621 A.2d 445 (1993). Yet, as the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing continues to develop, and in light of the covenant’s essential factors as discerned from the existing case law, we cannot say, in examining the unadorned <span title="497" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-497">p. 497</span>record in this case, that an actionable claim cannot be found in plaintiffs’ allegations.</p>
<p id="036a5dcd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In granting defendant’s motion to dismiss, we understand the Law Division to have relied on two points: the parties’ equal strength at the time the contract was formed and plaintiffs’ assertion of oral discussions unreflected by the written contract. We find erroneous both the undue emphasis placed on the absence of plaintiffs’ financial vulnerability and the misperceived importance of the parol evidence rule, particularly when viewed at the pleading stage.</p>
<p id="036a5dce-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>A</b></p>
<p id="036a5dcf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Sons of Thunder</i> — often viewed as a watershed event in the course of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing — is, perhaps, the best example of how a plaintiff’s unequal bargaining power will bring the implied covenant to the forefront even if defendant acted in conformity with the express terms of the contract. In the wake of <i>Sons of Thunder,</i> it certainly would have been fair to conclude that bargaining power is a critical aspect of any application of the implied covenant to a contractual dispute.</p>
<p id="036a5dd0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Sons of Thunder,</i> the Court emphasized the parties’ unequal bargaining power as one factor in finding a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. <i>Sons of Thunder</i> involved an operator of a vessel which contracted to supply clams to Borden. Even though the contract’s term was for one year and was also terminable on 90 days’ notice, the Court found that Borden could still be found to have violated the implied covenant because it had preyed on Sons of Thunder’s lack of sophistication and desperate financial straits. The Court stressed the importance of protecting and vindicating plaintiff’s expectations particularly in light of the significant investments made by Sons of Thunder in anticipation of Borden’s good faith performance. The Court also emphasized this feature in the earlier case of Bak-A-Lum Corp. v. Alcoa Bldg. Prods., Inc., 69 N.J. 123, 130, 351 A.2d 349 (1976). That these two seminal cases in the growth of the implied covenant stressed economic dependency and financial strength understandably suggests the importance of this factor. Nevertheless, while disparate strength may sometimes be a prominent feature, it is not the <i>sine qua non</i> of such a cause of action. It is merely one factor among many to be considered. . . . </p>
<p id="036a5dd1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, it is undisputed that the parties are all sophisticated and financially strong; it appears undisputed that plaintiffs possessed sufficient bargaining power during the formation of their agreement with Summit. According to their own contentions, plaintiffs have been in the insurance industry for several years and built two very successful brokerage firms. Furthermore, the record reflects that both parties were assisted by able counsel in negotiating their agreement. But equal bargaining power and the advice of competent counsel at the formation of the contract are not determinative. Rather, we conclude that while the bargaining power and sophistication of the parties must be viewed as significant, and should be considered in the analysis of any such dispute, it is not the sole criterion by which this claim must be resolved.</p>

<p id="036a5dd3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We also discern from her oral opinion that the Law Division judge believed plaintiffs would be unable to substantiate their claim because, in reality, they seek to prove some oral agreement dehors the written contract. In short, the Law Division judge appears to have found the parol evidence rule an insurmountable obstacle to plaintiffs’ claim. We find this erroneous.</p>
<p id="036a5dd4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The parol evidence rule prohibits the introduction of oral promises which tend to alter or vary an integrated written instrument. . . . Parol evidence may, however, be admitted in order to provide understanding into the parties’ intentions. . . . </p>
<p id="036a5dd5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Put in the present context, it must first be observed that the parol evidence rule does not even come into play “until it is first determined what the true agreement of the parties is.” <i>Ibid.</i> Accordingly, the rule cannot inhibit the application of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing because that covenant is contained in all contracts made in New Jersey by operation of law. Sons of Thunder, 148 N.J. at 420, 690 A.2d 575. Moreover, the central premise of the implied covenant is the enhanced status of the parties’ reasonable expectations. If the parol evidence rule is vigorously applied in such situations, the opportunity to pursue such a claim would be extremely limited. The manner in which our courts have defined the scope of the covenant demonstrates the fallacy of such a broad application of the parol evidence rule.</p>
<p id="036a5dd6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing has been applied in three general ways, each largely unaffected by the parol evidence rule. First, the covenant permits the inclusion of terms and conditions which have not been expressly set forth in the written contract. The earlier cases, such as <i>Bak-A-Lum</i> . . . and <i>Onderdonk</i> . . . provide examples of the imposition of absent terms and conditions. The covenant acts in such instances to include terms “the parties must have intended . . . because they are necessary to give business efficacy” to the contract. New Jersey Bank v. Palladino, 77 N.J. 33, 46, 389 A.2d 454 (1978). . . . Second, the covenant has been utilized to allow redress for the bad faith performance of an agreement even when the defendant has not breached any express term, as in <i>Sons of Thunder.</i> And third, the covenant has been held, in more recent cases, to permit inquiry into a party’s exercise of discretion expressly granted by a contract’s terms. See Wilson v. Amerada Hess Corporation, 168 N.J. 236, 250, 773 A.2d 1121 (2001); R.J. Gaydos Ins. Agency, Inc. v. National Consumer Ins. Co., 168 N.J. 255, 281, 773 A.2d 1132 (2001); Emerson Radio, 253 F.3d at 170-172.</p>
<p id="036a5dd7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second aspect, exemplified by <i>Sons of Thunder,</i> and the third, represented by cases such as <i>Wilson,</i> are implicated in this case. In both these situations, the parol evidence rule has a potential for coming into play. For, while the implied covenant has gone far in altering the way in which contractual performance will be weighed, our Supreme Court has consistently held that the “implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing cannot override an express term in a contract.” <i>Wilson</i>, 168 N.J. at 244, 773 A.2d 1121; <i>Sons of Thunder</i>, 148 N.J. at 419, 690 A.2d 575. But, instead of altering or overriding an express term, the <span title="499" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-499">p. 499</span>implied covenant requires that a contracting party act in good faith when exercising either discretion in performing its contractual obligations . . . or its right to terminate. . . . Accordingly, it may occur that a party will be found to have breached the implied covenant even if the action complained of does not violate a “pertinent express term.” <i>Wilson,</i> 168 N.J. at 244, 773 A.2d 1121. By staying within those parameters, the implied covenant — while necessarily “vague and amorphous” . . . — remains faithful to the purposes of the parol evidence rule.</p>
<p id="036a5dd8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, it can readily be seen that the parol evidence rule appears to have no present application in the case at hand. By concluding that plaintiffs seek to prove an oral agreement outside the bounds of a fully integrated written contract, the Law Division judge misapprehended the scope of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and overly-expanded the importance of the parol evidence rule. The parol evidence rule is not impacted because the obligation to act with good faith and fair dealing is, by its very nature, “implied.” The prohibition on parol evidence to alter or vary a written contract relates, in the present context, only to the creation of the contract. Because the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is implied by operation of law, the view that the parol evidence rule somehow inhibits plaintiffs’ claim is erroneous. And, because plaintiffs do not seek to contradict or alter any express term in their written contract, but rather question Summit’s <i>bona fides</i> in both its performance and termination of the contract, there presently appears to be no concern that the particular manner in which plaintiffs would have the implied covenant applied would run afoul of the parol evidence rule.</p>
<p id="036a5dd9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To determine what is considered a good faith performance, the court must consider the expectations of the parties and the purposes for which the contract was made. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to make that determination without considering evidence outside the written memorialization of the parties’ agreement. Therefore, in determining whether a breach of the covenant has occurred, a court must allow for parol evidence and the Law Division’s determination that the need for parol evidence is fatal to the second amended complaint is erroneous.</p>

<p id="036a84f0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, plaintiffs appear to urge an application of both the second and third facets of the implied covenant.

In this case, the second amended complaint alleges circumstances which, if proven, might support a claim based upon Summit’s termination of their relationship. To some extent, plaintiffs alleged there was an expectation — despite the express contractual right of Summit to terminate — that the relationship would last until they reached retirement age. This contention would, on its face, fall within that type of implied covenant claim prohibiting a party from terminating a contractual relationship in bad faith notwithstanding the expressed right to do so.</p>
<p id="036a84f2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second amended complaint also alleges that Summit used insufficient energy in discretionary areas.

Supp. 2d at 311, it is best to entrust the drawing of such a line to trial judges and juries with the admonition that an unduly expansive version of bad faith, as Judge Greenberg cautioned in <i>Northview Motors,</i> “could become an all-embracing statement of the parties’ obligations under contract law, imposing unintended obligations upon parties and destroying the mutual benefits created by legally binding agreements.” 227 F.3d at 92. In the final analysis, bad faith must be judged not only in light <span title="502" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-502">p. 502</span>of the proofs regarding the defendant’s state of mind but also in the context from which the claim arose. The Court in <i>Wilson</i> coupled the element of bad faith with a requirement that the plaintiff demonstrate a violation of “any commercially reasonable standard.” 168 N.J. at 253, 773 A.2d 1121. Accordingly, this element may be determined, at least in part, by the nature of the parties’ undertaking and the standards applicable to the business or industry in which they have engaged. Ultimately, however, the presence of bad faith is to be found in the eye of the beholder or, more to the point, in the eye of the trier of fact. Any attempt to provide greater definition is to expect some “delusive exactness” which, as Justice Holmes said, is “a source of fallacy throughout the law.” Truax v. Corrigan, 257 U.S. 312, 342, 42 S. Ct. 124, 133, 66 L. Ed. 254, 267 (1921) (dissenting opinion).</p>
<p id="036aac0f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even though the order of dismissal was not based upon some insufficiency in regard to its allegations of bad faith, we lastly pause, in providing guidance for future proceedings in this case, to observe that the second amended complaint was adequate in this regard, alleging that plaintiffs “suffered as a result of . . . Summit’s bad faith” and that Summit’s actions were “wanton and willful and without privilege or right.” Whether plaintiffs’ proofs will meet the bad faith standard defined in <i>Wilson,</i> or even survive summary judgment, remains to be seen. This question, however, certainly cannot be resolved until the parties are at least given a full and fair opportunity for further investigation and discovery.</p>

<p id="036aac11-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To summarize, plaintiffs’ claim of a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is not precluded merely because the parties possessed equal bargaining power, or because plaintiffs were not financially vulnerable during the contract’s formation, or even if the plaintiffs negotiated the contract with the assistance of highly competent counsel. These are factors which the trier of fact may consider in weighing the sufficiency of plaintiffs’ claim but they are not the only factors. Also, we conclude that the parol evidence rule presently appears to have no impact upon the ability of plaintiffs to substantiate either their claim that they had a reasonable expectation of a continued relationship (notwithstanding the expressed right of Summit to terminate), or their claim that Summit failed to perform its contractual obligations in good faith. And lastly, while the appropriate level of bad faith may be difficult to define and may also vary depending upon the nature of the alleged breach and the type of business engaged in by the parties, we find plaintiffs’ allegations of bad faith and ill motives are sufficient to survive dismissal.</p>

<li class=""><p id="036aac16-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Applications of the good faith principle.</i> In the course of its discussion, the <i>Seidenberg</i> court gives us an overview of the ways in which the doctrine of good faith may come into play in the course of adjudicating a contract dispute. First, a court may be persuaded that in order for the contract between the parties to have “business efficacy,” it is necessary to imply terms not expressly incorporated in the agreement. The court is careful to add, as have many other courts and commentators, that it will not imply any term that conflicts with the express terms of the parties’ agreement. Second, the court in <i>Seidenberg</i> indicates that the covenant of good faith may permit a finding of breach even where no express term of the agreement has been violated. <i>Seidenberg</i> itself appears to be, potentially, an example of such as a case; so also are the <i>Sons of Thunder</i> and <i>Mathis</i> cases, discussed in the following notes. (<i>Nanakuli</i> could also be so described.) And finally, the notion of good faith has often been applied to judge the appropriateness of a party’s exercise of some type of discretion expressly granted to it by the terms of a contract. The next two principal cases, Morin Bldg. Products Co. v. Baystone Constr. Inc., and Locke v. Warner Bros. Inc., exemplify this latter type of analysis in two very different settings.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="036aac17-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Application of the parol evidence rule</i>. In light of the recent tendency of some courts toward a higher regard for the “formalism” reflected in the parol evidence rule, note the <i>Seidenberg</i> court’s treatment of that issue. While conceding that the parol evidence rule might apply in a case where the offered evidence appears to directly contradict an express term in the contract, the appellate court asserts that because the obligation of good faith is an implied term rather than an express one, the parol evidence rule will ordinarily be irrelevant to the issue of its existence and application. Do you agree that the parol evidence rule should not be relevant to resolution of the plaintiff’s claims in <i>Seidenberg</i>?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="036aac18-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Express terms versus duty of good faith</i>. The court in <i>Seidenberg</i> describes Sons of Thunder v. Borden, Inc., 690 A.2d 575 (N.J. 1997), as a case that is “often viewed as a watershed event in the course of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,” demonstrating as it does a situation where, in light of all the circumstances, the court may apply the covenant of good faith and fair dealing even where the defendant has apparently “acted in conformity with the express terms of the contract.” In that case, the plaintiffs invested large amounts of funds in clam-fishing vessels, based on assurances of purchases to be made by the defendant Borden. Borden, however, consistently failed to make these purchases and eventually exercised an express right to terminate the contracts with 60 and 90 days’ notice. The New Jersey Supreme Court agreed with the defendant that the implied covenant of good faith could not override the express right to terminate, but also held that Borden could have breached the implied covenant of good faith in its <i>performance</i> before exercising the right to terminate. The court stated that Borden “destroyed Sons of Thunder’s reasonable expectations and right to receive the fruits of the contract” by never buying the required amount of clams. 690 A.2d at 589.</p>

<p id="036aac19-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Resolving the tension between express terms in a contract and the implied duty of good faith continues to be a significant challenge for the courts. As stated by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, a party may breach the implied duty of good faith by defeating the purpose of the contract even without technically violating an express provision, but, on the other hand, the implied covenant cannot be used to “undo express terms of an agreement.” Beidel v. Sideline Software, Inc., 842 N.W.2d 240, 250-251 (Wis. 2013) (holding that on remand court would need to decide whether employer’s financially advantageous timing of decision to repurchase stock from minority shareholder was permitted by plain language of contract). Similarly, a federal judge noted the absence of consistency among the courts, with ardent and persuasive decisions on both sides of the debate, before concluding that the express term in the particular case allowing each party discretion to approve assignment of a contract would not be restricted by an implied duty of good faith. Humantech, Inc. v. Caterpillar, Inc., 2012 WL 6214371 (E.D. Mich.).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="036aac1a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Need to show bad faith or ill motive.</i> The <i>Seidenberg</i> court also held that establishing a breach of the covenant of good faith would require a showing of bad faith or ill motive. The effect of that approach is that merely arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable conduct is not a breach of the implied duty. The requisite ill motive could be found in the intentional exercise of discretion to deprive a contracting partner of the reasonable expectations under the contract, as alleged in the cited New Jersey case, Wilson v. Amerada Hess Corp. (involving the seller’s discretion in setting gasoline prices) and illustrated by cases in the following note. See also Deom v. Walgreen Co., 591 Fed. Appx. 313 (6th Cir. 2014) (court holds that Illinois law requires improper motive intended to prevent other party from receiving “fruits of the bargain” and not just negligent, arbitrary, or unreasonable behavior, in dismissing seller’s claim that buyer breached covenant by failing to promote pharmacy business sales upon which seller’s bonus depended).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="036aac1b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Good faith and open price terms.</i> As we have noted earlier, the definition of good faith incorporated in UCC §1-201(b)(20) recognizes the obligations of both subjective honesty in fact and objective commercially reasonable behavior. The distinction between those two standards was highlighted in Mathis v. Exxon Corp., 302 F.3d 448 (5th Cir. 2002). A group of 54 plaintiff franchisees alleged that Exxon breached the duty of good faith in setting gasoline prices for the purpose of driving the franchisees out of business and then replacing them with stores owned directly by Exxon. The Fifth Circuit noted that the contract expressly allowed Exxon to set the prices at which it would sell gasoline to the franchisees, that Comment 3 to UCC §2-305 suggested that a “posted price” set by a merchant would “normally” meet the requirements of good faith, and that the prices charged by Exxon were comparable to its competitors. Id. at 453-454. Nevertheless, the court upheld a jury verdict against Exxon for $5.7 million on the strength of substantial evidence that Exxon set its prices to the franchisees at a level that was intended to make the franchises unprofitable and drive them out of business. Thus, a breach of the duty of good faith could be shown through the improper motive even though the prices set might <span title="505" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-505">p. 505</span>appear to be objectively reasonable. Id. at 458-459. Accord Marcoux v. Shell Oil Products Co., LLC, 524 F.3d 33 (1st Cir. 2008) (finding that a situation in which a merchant is raising its prices to drive its customer out of business is “hardly the ‘normal case’ ”); contra Shell Oil Co. v. HRN, Inc., 144 S.W.3d 429 (Tex. 2004) (holding that subjective bad faith by refiner in attempt to force dealers out of business is irrelevant as long as the refiner is charging “commercially reasonable” prices and is not discriminating among its purchasers).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="036aac1c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The duty of good faith in loan agreements.</i> “Lender liability” is a term that refers to claims asserted by borrowers against lenders for alleged misconduct by the lender in connection with a loan transaction. The claim may be based on various legal theories. See Michelle Z. McDonald, The Complicated World of Lender Liability, 40 Colo. Law. 13 (Apr. 2011). Loan agreements sometimes provide that the lender may call the loan “on demand.” One type of lender liability case involves a claim by the borrower that the lender exercised this right in bad faith. Courts have been divided on the effect of the duty of good faith in these situations. In K.M.C. Co., Inc. v. Irving Trust Co., 757 F.2d 752 (6th Cir. 1985), the court held that the duty of good faith limited a lender’s express right to terminate a financing agreement with and demand repayment from a grocery business, especially since the lender also had control of the grocery business’s bank account with its operating funds. In contrast, however, many subsequent decisions have been critical of <i>K.M.C.</i> on the ground that the court effectively overrode the express terms of the contract. See Reger Dev., LLC v. National City Bank, 592 F.3d 759 (7th Cir. 2010) (holding that the implied covenant of good faith cannot limit express contract rights). The courts giving priority to the express provisions in loan agreements find support in the official comment to UCC §1-309, which states that the obligation of good faith “has no application to demand instruments . . . whose very nature permits call at any time with or without reason.”</p>
<p id="036aac1d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In another line of cases involving discretionary conduct by lenders, home loan borrowers (or mortgagors) have alleged that the lenders (or mortgagees) have abused their express contract right to obtain hazard insurance for the home, if the borrower fails to provide the insurance herself, and add the costs to the loan balance. The borrowers typically allege that the lenders purchase such “force-placed” insurance at highly inflated prices in collusion with certain insurers and in return for “kickbacks,” and thereby breach the implied covenant of good faith. See, e.g., Hamilton v. Suntrust Mortg. Inc., 6 F. Supp. 3d 1300 (S.D. Fla. 2014) (denying lender’s motion to dismiss and finding that plaintiff had stated a claim for breach of implied covenant of good faith); Gallo v. PHH Mortg. Corp., 916 F. Supp. 2d 537 (D.N.J. 2012) (finding that plaintiff stated a claim for lender breach of implied covenant of good faith by exercising discretion in unreasonable and bad faith manner designed to reap improper financial benefit).</p></li>

<div class="epub-heading left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="036aac1e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56">Comment: Requirements and Output Contracts</p></h3></div>
<p id="036aac1f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although a contract to buy and sell goods, even a long-term one, may be very precise in stating the quantity of goods to be delivered, often the parties <span title="506" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-506">p. 506</span>choose instead to leave that term flexible. Sometimes the parties will agree that the seller undertakes to supply all goods of a given type that the buyer may “require” during the term of their contract; in other cases, the buyer will be obligated to buy all the seller’s “output” of a given commodity. Such arrangements, likely to stretch over a period of months or even years, may be commercially advantageous to both parties. On the one hand, they provide the output seller with a guaranteed market for its goods, and the requirements buyer with an assured source for its needs. They do involve some risk for the other party, to be sure, but if the output buyer is confident that it can use as much as the seller is likely to produce, the risk may appear small; conversely, the requirements seller may see little chance that the buyer’s requirements will exceed its capacity to supply. Those risks may of course be further controlled by contractual provisions imposing some maximum on the output buyer’s obligation to buy, or the requirements seller’s obligation to supply.</p>
<p id="036aac20-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Initially, “requirements” contracts got a cold reception from American courts. They were frequently held invalid on various grounds: as lacking in consideration (the buyer was felt to have made only an illusory promise to buy); as lacking in mutuality (the seller was bound, but the buyer in effect was not); as too vague or indefinite for enforcement (the quantity that buyer was bound to purchase could not be precisely ascertained). Such agreements continued to be made, however, and answers to the objections described above were developed. The theoretical problem of lack of consideration was effectively met by Professor Corbin, who asserted that consideration existed because of the commitment by the buyer to either buy goods from the designated seller or <i>not buy at all.</i> See 1A Corbin on Contracts §156 (1960); Restatement (Second) §77. The buyer’s performance of such an agreement does therefore entail sufficient legal “detriment” to constitute consideration because each alternative would have been sufficient consideration if bargained for separately. See Restatement (Second) §77, Comment <i>b.</i></p>
<p id="036ad331-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second objection to enforcement of requirements contracts, their lack of mutuality, was met by a growing willingness (which we have already noted in Chapter 2) on the part of courts and commentators to demote mutuality of obligation to the status of a mere corollary of the consideration rule, with no independent force of its own. And the indefiniteness problem in many cases was overcome by the fact that sufficient information to allow for enforcement can often be gleaned from the buyer’s past history, estimates by the parties, a prior course of dealing between them, or their course of performance under the agreement at issue. See, e.g., Eastern Air Lines, Inc. v. Gulf Oil Corp., 415 F. Supp. 429, 436-437 (S.D. Fla. 1975) (obligation of Eastern to purchase fuel exclusively from Gulf, but only at certain cities, was enforceable and would be construed in light of extensive past dealings between the parties and industry practices).</p>
<p id="036ad332-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, by the time the Uniform Commercial Code was drafted, the requirements contract had a long legal history. In §2-306, the drafters of the Code apparently attempted to continue the trend toward validation of such agreements in general, and also to provide assistance to any court that must <span title="507" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-507">p. 507</span>decide whether a particular “requirements buyer” or “output seller” has failed to perform its obligation. See generally Elliot Axelrod, The Requirements Contract — What Is Required?, 31 Drake L. Rev. 83 (1981). Even today, however, an agreement that does not to some appreciable degree bind the buyer to buy <i>only</i> from the particular seller is likely to be viewed as invalid and unenforceable, because lacking in consideration or mutuality of obligation. See, e.g., Brooklyn Bagel Boys, Inc. v. Earthgrains Refrigerated Dough Products, Inc., 212 F.3d 373 (7th Cir. 2000) (contract which contained price structure and required buyer’s “non-binding” forecast of needs every three months held not to be requirements contract because buyer was not required to buy all of its bagels or any specified quantity from seller). Sometimes, however, courts will find an implied promise of exclusivity that renders the contract binding. See, e.g., Essco Geometric v. Harvard Indus., 46 F.3d 718 (8th Cir. 1995) (extrinsic evidence established that both buyer and seller understood arrangement to be exclusive even though not expressly stated in letter agreement); Pepsi-Cola Co. v. Steak ‘N Shake, Inc., 981 F. Supp. 1149 (S.D. Ind. 1997) (contract must be read as a whole to determine parties’ intent; exclusivity may be implied).</p>
<p id="036ad333-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Comments to UCC §2-306 include further suggestions on the operation of requirements and output contracts, including the possibility (Comment 3) that the agreement may contain a “maximum or minimum.” Comment 2 indicates that the seller in a requirements contract is to be protected against increases in demand that exceed the bounds of “good faith.” A “ballooning” of demand by a requirements buyer has often been held to be in bad faith, both at common law and under the Code. See, e.g., A&amp;A Mechanical, Inc. v. Thermal Equip. Sales, Inc., 998 S.W. 2d 505 (Ky. Ct. App. 1999) (assuming contract for duct work came under UCC §2-306, 29% increase in quantity would be unreasonable deviation from estimate). The Code also protects the requirements seller against a bad faith reduction in the buyer’s demand, but this has proven somewhat more problematic for the courts. Generally courts have held that a requirements buyer may reduce its level of purchases even to zero, so long as it acts in good faith. See Empire Gas Corp. v. American Bakeries, Inc., 840 F.2d 1333 (7th Cir. 1988) (holding that requirements buyer may reduce its level of demand even to zero so long as it acts in good faith); but see Simcala, Inc. v. American Coal Trade, Inc., 821 So. 2d 197 (Ala. 2001) (holding that principles of statutory interpretation require that decreases not be disproportionate to any estimate under plain meaning of UCC §2-306(1); buyer’s decrease in purchases from estimate of 17,500 tons of coal to 7,200 tons would be a breach even if buyer acted in good faith).</p>
<p id="036ad334-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Assuming that a court applies the test of good faith to a substantial reduction in purchases by a requirements buyer, how is breach established? The cases in this area are not altogether clear, but the reduction will probably be in good faith if resulting directly from reasons beyond the buyer’s control. E.g., R. A. Weaver &amp; Associates, Inc. v. Asphalt Constr., Inc., 587 F.2d 1315 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (defendant buyer not liable for breach after construction project was altered to eliminate use of limestone that plaintiff had contracted to supply). In contrast, a buyer that attempts to procure its requirements more cheaply <span title="508" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-508">p. 508</span>elsewhere or with intent to harm the seller is clearly acting in bad faith. See Chemical Distributors, Inc. v. Exxon Corp., 1 F.3d 1478 (5th Cir. 1993) (jury finding of bad faith justified by evidence that buyer bypassed seller to purchase requirements directly and more inexpensively from manufacturer and in effort to eliminate seller as competitor in related market). Likewise, termination of an output contract by a seller is likely to be judged by a standard very similar to that generally applied in evaluating reduction of requirements by a buyer. See Feld v. Henry S. Levy &amp; Sons, Inc., 335 N.E.2d 320 (N.Y. 1975) (while bankruptcy or imperilment of the company’s existence would justify termination of bread crumb production, mere yield of less profit would not be a good faith reason).</p>

<p id="036ad33b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This appeal from a judgment for the plaintiff in a diversity suit requires us to interpret Indiana’s common law of contracts. General Motors, which is not a party to this case, hired Baystone Construction, Inc., the defendant, to build an addition to a Chevrolet plant in Muncie, Indiana. Baystone hired Morin Building Products Company, the plaintiff, to supply and erect the aluminum walls for the addition. The contract required that the exterior siding of the walls be of “aluminum type 3003, not less than 18 B &amp; S gauge, with a mill finish and stucco embossed surface texture to match finish and texture of existing metal siding.” The contract also provided “that all work shall be done subject to the final approval of the Architect or Owner’s [General Motors’] authorized agent, and his decision in matters relating to artistic effect shall be final, if within the terms of the Contract Documents”; and that “should any dispute arise as to the quality or fitness of materials or workmanship, the decision as to acceptability shall rest strictly with the Owner, based on the requirement that all work done or materials furnished shall be first class in every respect. What is usual or customary in erecting other buildings shall in no wise enter into any consideration or decision.”</p>
<p id="036ad33c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Morin put up the walls. But viewed in bright sunlight from an acute angle the exterior siding did not give the impression of having a uniform finish, and General Motors’ representative rejected it. Baystone removed Morin’s siding and hired another subcontractor to replace it. General Motors approved the replacement siding. Baystone refused to pay Morin the balance of the contract price ($23,000) and Morin brought this suit for the balance, and won.</p>
<p id="036ad33d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The only issue on appeal is the correctness of a jury instruction which, after quoting the contractual provisions requiring that the owner (General Motors) be satisfied with the contractor’s (Morin’s) work, states: “Notwithstanding the apparent finality of the foregoing language, however, the general rule applying to satisfaction in the case of contracts for the construction of commercial buildings is that the satisfaction clause must be determined by objective <span title="509" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-509">p. 509</span>criteria. Under this standard, the question is not whether the owner was satisfied in fact, but whether the owner, as a reasonable person, should have been satisfied with the materials and workmanship in question.” There was much evidence that General Motors’ rejection of Morin’s exterior siding had been totally unreasonable. Not only was the lack of absolute uniformity in the finish of the walls a seemingly trivial defect given the strictly utilitarian purpose of the building that they enclosed, but it may have been inevitable; “mill finish sheet” is defined in the trade as “sheet having a nonuniform finish which may vary from sheet to sheet and within a sheet, and may not be entirely free from stains or oil.” If the instruction was correct, so was the judgment. But if the instruction was incorrect — if the proper standard is not whether a reasonable man would have been satisfied with Morin’s exterior siding but whether General Motors’ authorized representative in fact was — then there must be a new trial to determine whether he really was dissatisfied, or whether he was not and the rejection therefore was in bad faith.</p>
<p id="036afa4e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some cases hold that if the contract provides that the seller’s performance must be to the buyer’s satisfaction, his rejection — however unreasonable — of the seller’s performance is not a breach of the contract unless the rejection is in bad faith. See, e.g., Stone Mountain Properties, Ltd. v. Helmer, 139 Ga. App. 865, 869, 229 S.E.2d 779, 783 (1976). But most cases conform to the position stated in section 228 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts (1979): if “it is practicable to determine whether a reasonable person in the position of the obligor would be satisfied, an interpretation is preferred under which the condition [that the obligor be satisfied with the obligee’s performance] occurs if such a reasonable person in the position of the obligor would be satisfied.” See Farnsworth, Contracts 556-559 (1982); Annot., 44 A.L.R.2d 1114, 1117, 1119-1120 (1955). Indiana Tri-City Plaza Bowl, Inc. v. Estate of Glueck, 422 N.E.2d 670, 675 (Ind. App. 1981) . . . adopts the majority position as the law of Indiana.</p>
<p id="036afa4f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not understand the majority position to be paternalistic; and paternalism would be out of place in a case such as this, where the subcontractor is a substantial multistate enterprise. The requirement of reasonableness is read into a contract not to protect the weaker party but to approximate what the parties would have expressly provided with respect to a contingency that they did not foresee, if they had foreseen it. Therefore the requirement is not read into every contract, because it is not always a reliable guide to the parties’ intentions. In particular, the presumption that the performing party would not have wanted to put himself at the mercy of the paying party’s whim is overcome when the nature of the performance contracted for is such that there are no objective standards to guide the court. It cannot be assumed in such a case that the parties would have wanted a court to second-guess the buyer’s rejection. So “the reasonable person standard is employed when the contract involves commercial quality, operative fitness, or mechanical utility which other knowledgeable persons can judge. . . . The standard of good faith is employed when the contract involves personal aesthetics or fancy.” Indiana Tri-City Plaza Bowl, Inc. v. Estate of Glueck, supra, 422 N.E.2d at 675; see also Action Engineering v. Martin Marietta Aluminum, 670 F.2d 456, 460-461 (3d Cir. 1982).</p>
<p id="036afa50-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="510" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-510">p. 510</span>We have to decide which category the contract between Baystone and Morin belongs in. The particular in which Morin’s aluminum siding was found wanting was its appearance, which may seem quintessentially a matter of “personal aesthetics,” or as the contract put it, “artistic effect.” But it is easy to imagine situations where this would not be so. Suppose the manager of a steel plant rejected a shipment of pig iron because he did not think the pigs had a pretty shape. The reasonable-man standard would be applied even if the contract had an “acceptability shall rest strictly with the Owner” clause, for it would be fantastic to think that the iron supplier would have subjected his contract rights to the whimsy of the buyer’s agent. At the other extreme would be a contract to paint a portrait, the buyer having reserved the right to reject the portrait if it did not satisfy him. Such a buyer wants a portrait that will please him rather than a jury, even a jury of connoisseurs, so the only question would be his good faith in rejecting the portrait, Gibson v. Cranage, 39 Mich. 49 (1878).</p>
<p id="036afa51-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case is closer to the first example than to the second. The building for which the aluminum siding was intended was a factory — not usually intended to be a thing of beauty. That aesthetic considerations were decidedly secondary to considerations of function and cost is suggested by the fact that the contract specified mill-finish aluminum, which is unpainted. There is much debate in the record over whether it is even possible to ensure a uniform finish within and among sheets, but it is at least clear that mill finish usually is not uniform. If General Motors and Baystone had wanted a uniform finish they would in all likelihood have ordered a painted siding. Whether Morin’s siding achieved a reasonable uniformity amounting to satisfactory commercial quality was susceptible of objective judgment; in the language of the Restatement, a reasonableness standard was “practicable.”</p>
<p id="036afa52-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But this means only that a requirement of reasonableness would be read into this contract if it contained a standard owner’s satisfaction clause, which it did not; and since the ultimate touchstone of decision must be the intent of the parties to the contract we must consider the actual language they used. The contract refers explicitly to “artistic effect,” a choice of words that may seem deliberately designed to put the contract in the “personal aesthetics” category whatever an outside observer might think. But the reference appears as number 17 in a list of conditions in a general purpose form contract. And the words “artistic effect” are immediately followed by the qualifying phrase, “if within the terms of the Contract Documents,” which suggests that the “artistic effect” clause is limited to contracts in which artistic effect is one of the things the buyer is aiming for; it is not clear that he was here. The other clause on which Baystone relies, relating to the quality or fitness of workmanship and materials, may seem all-encompassing, but it is qualified by the phrase, “based on the requirement that all work done or materials furnished shall be first class in every respect” — and it is not clear that Morin’s were not. This clause also was not drafted for this contract; it was incorporated by reference to another form contract (the Chevrolet Division’s “Contract General Conditions”), of which it is paragraph 35. We do not disparage form contracts, without which the commercial life of the nation would grind to a halt. But we are left with more than a <span title="511" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-511">p. 511</span>suspicion that the artistic-effect and quality-fitness clauses in the form contract used here were not intended to cover the aesthetics of a mill-finish aluminum factory wall.</p>
<p id="036afa53-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If we are right, Morin might prevail even under the minority position, which makes good faith the only standard but presupposes that the contract conditioned acceptance of performance on the buyer’s satisfaction in the particular respect in which he was dissatisfied. Maybe this contract was not intended to allow General Motors to reject the aluminum siding on the basis of artistic effect. It would not follow that the contract put Morin under no obligations whatsoever with regard to uniformity of finish. The contract expressly required it to use aluminum having “a mill finish . . . to match finish . . . of existing metal siding.” The jury was asked to decide whether a reasonable man would have found that Morin had used aluminum sufficiently uniform to satisfy the matching requirement. This was the right standard if, as we believe, the parties would have adopted it had they foreseen this dispute. It is unlikely that Morin intended to bind itself to a higher and perhaps unattainable standard of achieving whatever perfection of matching that General Motors’ agent insisted on, or that General Motors would have required Baystone to submit to such a standard. Because it is difficult — maybe impossible — to achieve a uniform finish with mill-finish aluminum, Morin would have been running a considerable risk of rejection if it had agreed to such a condition, and it therefore could have been expected to demand a compensating increase in the contract price. This would have required General Motors to pay a premium to obtain a freedom of action that it could not have thought terribly important, since its objective was not aesthetic. If a uniform finish was important to it, it could have gotten such a finish by specifying painted siding.</p>
<p id="036afa54-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All this is conjecture; we do not know how important the aesthetics were to General Motors when the contract was signed or how difficult it really would have been to obtain the uniformity of finish it desired. The fact that General Motors accepted the replacement siding proves little, for there is evidence that the replacement siding produced the same striped effect, when viewed from an acute angle in bright sunlight, that Morin’s had. When in doubt on a difficult issue of state law it is only prudent to defer to the view of the district judge, Murphy v. White Hen Pantry Co., 691 F.2d 350, 354 (7th Cir. 1982), here an experienced Indiana lawyer who thought this the type of contract where the buyer cannot unreasonably withhold approval of the seller’s performance.</p>
<p id="036afa55-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lest this conclusion be thought to strike at the foundations of freedom of contract, we repeat that if it appeared from the language or circumstances of the contract that the parties really intended General Motors to have the right to reject Morin’s work for failure to satisfy the private aesthetic taste of General Motors’ representative, the rejection would have been proper even if unreasonable. But the contract is ambiguous because of the qualifications with which the terms “artistic effect” and “decision as to acceptability” are hedged about, and the circumstances suggest that the parties probably did not intend to subject Morin’s rights to aesthetic whim.</p>

<li class=""><p id="036afa59-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Interpretation of conditions of satisfactory performance.</i> Contracts frequently contain express terms that obligate one party to perform to the “satisfaction” of the other, or condition one party’s duty of performance on his “satisfaction” with the performance of the other party. As Judge Posner’s opinion in <i>Morin</i> illustrates, such provisions are unlikely to be interpreted as conferring on the party whose satisfaction is at issue an unlimited power to determine and declare his own dissatisfaction, without external check. Indeed, if pure unbridled discretion were the test, the party whose performance was so conditioned might be held to have made only an “illusory” promise, defeating the contract as a whole. Instead, one of the two approaches described in <i>Morin</i> will ordinarily be used: Either the obligor’s declaration of dissatisfaction will be judged by a standard of reasonableness; or at minimum he will be held to the standard of “honest” dissatisfaction. As Judge Posner states, the “objective” standard has been traditionally employed in cases where “commercial quality, operative fitness, or mechanical utility” are in question, while the “subjective” standard is likely to be employed where “personal aesthetics or fancy” are at issue.</p>
<p id="036afa5a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In an extensive survey of the “satisfaction” cases, Conditions of Personal Satisfaction in the Law of Contract, 27 N.Y.L. Sch. L. Rev. 103 (1981), Professor James Brook pointed out that early decisions did not make the objective/subjective distinction; all cases, whether involving “mechanical utility” or not, were judged by the same, subjective standard of the promisee’s honest dissatisfaction. Following later case law, Restatement (Second) §228 declares that the objective test should be preferred when it is “practicable to determine whether a reasonable person in the position of the obligor would be satisfied.” Comment <i>a</i> to §228 indicates that the subjective standard should be used only where “the agreement leaves no doubt that it is only honest dissatisfaction that is meant and no more.” See Sky Angel U.S., LLC v. Discovery Communications, LLC, 95 F. Supp. 3d 860 (D. Md. 2015) (condition of satisfaction in video distribution services contract would be judged by preferred objective standard of reasonableness); FEI Enterprises, Inc. v. Kee Man Yoon, 124 Cal. Rptr. 3d 64 (Ct. App. 2011) (holding that generally the law prefers an objective standard). Where personal services are involved, the court may be more likely to approve the use of a subjective test. E.g., Silvestri v. Optus Software, Inc., 814 A.2d 602 (N.J. 2003) (subjective standard would apply to condition of satisfaction in employment contract for high-level business manager; employer entitled to be highly personal and idiosyncratic in judging performance of employee sharing responsibility for success of business).</p>
<p id="036b216b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where the contract conditions performance by one party on the other’s performance to the satisfaction of some independent third party, such as an architect or engineer, the Restatement (Second) indicates a greater tolerance for the application of a subjective test, on the assumption that a third party is less likely to be affected by the “selfish interests” of the obligor. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts §227, Comment <i>b,</i> Illustration 3, and §228, Comment <i>b.</i> Accord Hanscom v. Gregorie, 562 A.2d 1232 (Me. 1989) (defendants freed from purchase <span title="513" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-513">p. 513</span>obligation where their building inspector determined that plaintiff’s building was not free from “defects of a substantial nature,” even though trial court concluded that defects in question, though expensive to remedy, were not “substantial”; contract left that question to honest judgment of defendant’s expert).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="036b216c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Judge Posner’s analysis.</i> Does Judge Posner adequately justify the court’s choice of an objective standard in <i>Morin</i>? Comment <i>b</i> to Restatement (Second) §228 indicates that a preference for the objective test may be justified in part by the desire to avoid “forfeiture,” which the Restatement defines elsewhere (Comment <i>b</i> to §229) as “the denial of compensation that results when the obligee loses his right to the agreed exchange after he has relied substantially, as by preparation or performance on the expectation of that exchange.” Was this factor at work in <i>Morin</i>? (You will recall, incidentally, that Judge Posner as an academic was the leader of the so-called Chicago School of “efficiency” theorists. In that light, it is interesting to note in the <i>Morin</i> opinion his careful disclaimer of “paternalism” and his expression of solicitude for the “foundations of freedom of contract.”)</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="036b216d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Effect of standard of interpretation.</i> Even where the court does agree with the defendant that only the subjective test of “honest dissatisfaction” should be employed, one ought not to assume that the defendant will therefore ultimately prevail. Although the plaintiff’s burden of establishing that defendant was not honestly dissatisfied may be a difficult one, it is not necessarily impossible. E.g., Forman v. Benson, 446 N.E.2d 535 (Ill. App. Ct. 1983) (seller’s rejection of buyer’s credit report held pretextual, an attempt to renegotiate price and interest rate). Conversely, application of the objective, reasonableness standard will not necessarily produce a victory for the plaintiff. See, e.g., Kennedy Associates, Inc. v. Fischer, 667 P.2d 174 (Alaska 1983) (even under objective test, mortgage lender could reasonably disapprove property in question after conducting agreed inspection).</p></li>

<p id="036b4889-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1975, Locke came to Warner to appear with Clint Eastwood in <i>The Outlaw Josey Wales</i> (Warner Bros. 1976). During the filming of the movie, Locke and Eastwood began a personal and romantic relationship. For the next dozen years, they lived in Eastwood’s Los Angeles and Northern California homes. Locke also appeared in a number of Eastwood’s films. In 1986, Locke made her directorial debut in <i>Ratboy</i> (Warner Bros. 1986).</p>

<p id="036b488d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1988, the relationship deteriorated, and in 1989 Eastwood terminated it. Locke then brought suit against Eastwood, alleging numerous causes of action. That action was resolved by a November 21, 1990, settlement agreement and mutual general release. Under said agreement, Eastwood agreed to pay Locke additional compensation in the sum of $450,000 “on account of past employment and Locke’s contentions” and to convey certain real property to her.</p>
<p id="036b488e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>2. <span class="epub-small-caps">Locke’s Development Deal with Warner</span></b></p>
<p id="036b488f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to Locke, Eastwood secured a development deal for Locke with Warner in exchange for Locke’s dropping her case against him. Contemporaneously with the Locke/Eastwood settlement agreement, Locke entered into a written agreement with Warner, dated November 27, 1990. It is the Locke/Warner agreement which is the subject of the instant controversy.</p>
<p id="036b4890-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Locke/Warner agreement had two basic components. The first element states Locke would receive $250,000 per year for three years for a “non-exclusive first look deal.” It required Locke to submit to Warner any picture she was interested in developing before submitting it to any other studio. Warner then had 30 days either to approve or reject a submission.</p>
<p id="036b4891-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second element of the contract was a $750,000 “pay or play” directing deal. The provision is called “pay or play” because it gives the studio a choice: It can either “play” the director by using the director’s services, or pay the director his or her fee.</p>
<p id="036b4892-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unbeknownst to Locke at the time, Eastwood had agreed to reimburse Warner for the cost of her contract if she did not succeed in getting projects produced and developed. Early in the second year of the three-year contract, Warner charged $975,000 to an Eastwood film, <i>Unforgiven</i> (Warner Bros. 1992).</p>
<p id="036b4893-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="515" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-515">p. 515</span>Warner paid Locke the guaranteed compensation of $1.5 million under the agreement. In accordance with the agreement, Warner also provided Locke with an office on the studio lot and an administrative assistant. However, Warner did not develop any of Locke’s proposed projects or hire her to direct any films. Locke contends the development deal was a sham, that Warner never intended to make any films with her, and that Warner’s sole motivation in entering into the agreement was to assist Eastwood in settling his litigation with Locke.</p>

<p id="036b6fa5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On March 10, 1994, Locke filed suit against Warner, alleging four causes of action.</p>
<p id="036b6fa6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first cause of action alleged sex discrimination in violation of public policy. Locke alleged Warner denied her the benefit of the bargain of the development deal on account of her gender.</p>
<p id="036b6fa7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The third cause of action, captioned “Tortious Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing in Violation of Public Policy,” alleged a similar claim. Locke pled that in denying her the benefits of the Warner/Locke agreement, Warner was “motivated by [its] discriminatory bias against women in violation of . . . public policy.”</p>
<p id="036b6fa8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second cause of action alleged that Warner breached the contract by refusing to consider Locke’s proposed projects and thereby deprived her of the benefit of the bargain of the Warner/Locke agreement.</p>
<p id="036b6fa9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lastly, the fourth cause of action alleged fraud. Locke pled that at the time Warner entered into the agreement with her, it concealed and failed to disclose it had no intention of honoring the agreement.</p>
<p id="036b6faa-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Warner answered, denied each and every allegation and asserted various affirmative defenses.</p>

<p id="036b6fac-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On January 6, 1995, Warner filed a motion for summary judgment. Warner contended it did not breach its contract with Locke because it did consider all the projects she presented, and the studio’s decision not to put any of those projects into active development or “hand” Locke a script which it already owned was not a breach of any express or implied contractual duty. Warner asserted the odds are slim a producer can get a project into development and even slimmer a director will be hired to direct a film. During the term of Locke’s deal, Warner had similar deals with numerous other producers and directors, who fared no better than Locke.</p>
<p id="036b6fad-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As for Locke’s sex discrimination claims, Warner averred there was no evidence it ignored Locke’s projects or otherwise discriminated against her on account of her gender. Finally, Warner urged the fraud claim was meritless because Locke had no evidence that when Warner signed the contract, it did not intend to honor the deal, and moreover, Warner had fulfilled its contractual obligations to Locke.</p>
<p id="036b6fae-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In opposing summary judgment, Locke contended Warner breached the agreement in that it had no intention of accepting any project regardless of its <span title="516" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-516">p. 516</span>merits. Locke also asserted Warner committed fraud by entering into the agreement without any intention of approving any project with Locke or allowing Locke to direct another film.</p>
<p id="036b6faf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Locke’s opposition papers cited the deposition testimony of Joseph Terry, who recounted a conversation he had with Bob Brassel, a Warner executive, regarding Locke’s projects. Terry had stated to Brassel: “ ‘Well, Bob, this woman has a deal on the lot. She’s a director that you want to work with. You have a deal with her. . . . I’ve got five here that she’s interested in.’ And then I would get nothing. . . . I was told [by Brassel], ‘Joe, we’re not going to work with her,’ and then, ‘That’s Clint’s deal.’ And that’s something I just completely did not understand.”</p>
<p id="036b96c0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, the declaration of Mary Wellnitz stated: She worked with Locke to set up projects at Warner, without success. Shortly after she began her association with Locke, Wellnitz submitted a script to Lance Young, who at the time was a senior vice-president of production at Warner. After discussing the script, Young told Wellnitz, “Mary, I want you to know that I think Sondra is a wonderful woman and very talented, but, if you think I can go down the hall and tell Bob Daly that I have a movie I want to make with her he would tell me to forget it. They are not going to make a movie with her here.”</p>

<p id="036b96c2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On February 17, 1995, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Warner. Thereafter, the trial court signed an extensive order granting summary judgment. The order stated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="036b96c3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the contract, Warner had no obligation either to put into development any of the projects submitted to the studio for its consideration, or to “hand off” to Locke any scripts for her to direct that it previously had acquired from someone else. The implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing cannot be imposed to create a contract different from the one the parties negotiated for themselves. Warner had the option to pass on each project Locke submitted. Warner was not required to have a “good faith” or “fair” basis for declining to exercise its right to develop her material. Such a requirement would be improper and unworkable. A judge or jury cannot and should not substitute its judgment for a film studio’s when the studio is making the creative decision of whether to develop or produce a proposed motion picture. Such highly subjective artistic and business decisions are not proper subjects for judicial review. Moreover, Warner had legitimate commercial and artistic reasons for declining to develop the projects Locke submitted.</p>

<p id="036b96c4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With respect to Locke’s claim she was defrauded by Warner when it entered into the agreement with the undisclosed intention not to honor its contractual obligations, the trial court ruled that because Warner did not breach its contractual obligations to Locke, the fraud claim was meritless. Also, it could not be inferred from the statements by Young and Brassel that two years earlier, when Warner entered into agreement, it had no intention of working with Locke.</p>
<p id="036b96c5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As for the two causes of action alleging sex discrimination, the trial court found no evidence Warner declined to develop the projects Locke submitted, and declined to use her directing services, on account of her gender.</p>

<p id="036bbddf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court’s ruling missed the mark by failing to distinguish between Warner’s right to make a subjective creative decision, which is not reviewable for reasonableness, and the requirement the dissatisfaction be bona fide or genuine.</p>
<p id="036bbde0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>a. General principles.</b></p>
<p id="036bbde1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“ ‘[W]here a contract confers on one party a discretionary power affecting the rights of the other, a duty is imposed to exercise that discretion in good faith and in accordance with fair dealing.’[Citations.]” (Perdue v. Crocker National Bank (1985) 38 Cal. 3d 913, 923 [216 Cal. Rptr. 345, 702 P.2d 503]; accord, Kendall v. Ernest Pestana, Inc. (1985) 40 Cal. 3d 488, 500 [220 Cal. Rptr. 818, 709 P.2d 837].) It is settled that in “ ‘every contract there is an implied covenant that neither party shall do anything which will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party to receive the fruits of the contract. . . .’ ” (<i>Kendall,</i> supra, at p. 500; accord, Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc., supra, 11 Cal. 4th at p. 36.)</p>
<p id="036bbde2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Therefore, when it is a condition of an obligor’s duty that he or she be subjectively satisfied with respect to the obligee’s performance, the subjective standard of <i>honest satisfaction</i> is applicable. (1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1987) Contracts, §729, p. 659; Rest. 2d Contracts, §228, coms. a, b, pp.182-183.) “Where the contract involves matters of fancy, taste or judgment, the promisor is the sole judge of his satisfaction. If he asserts <i>in good faith</i> that he is not satisfied, there can be no inquiry into the reasonableness of <span title="518" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-518">p. 518</span>his attitude. [Citations.] Traditional examples are employment contracts . . . and agreements to paint a portrait, write a literary or scientific article, or produce a play or vaudeville act. [Citations.]” (1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, supra, §730, p. 660; accord, Schuyler v. Pantages (1921) 54 Cal. App. 83, 85-87 [201 P. 137].) In such cases, “the promisor’s determination that he is not satisfied, <i>when made in good faith,</i> has been held to be a defense to an action on the contract. [Citations.]” (Mattei v. Hopper (1958) 51 Cal. 2d 119, 123 [330 P.2d 625], italics added.)</p>
<p id="036bbde3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Therefore, the trial court erred in deferring entirely to what it characterized as Warner’s “creative decision” in the handling of the development deal. If Warner acted in bad faith by categorically rejecting Locke’s work and refusing to work with her, irrespective of the merits of her proposals, such conduct is not beyond the reach of the law.</p>
<p id="036bbde4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>b. Locke presented evidence from which a trier of fact reasonably could infer Warner breached the agreement by refusing to consider her proposals in good faith.</b></p>
<p id="036bbde5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Merely because Warner paid Locke the guaranteed compensation under the agreement does not establish Warner fulfilled its contractual obligation. As pointed out by Locke, the value in the subject development deal was not merely the guaranteed payments under the agreement, but also the opportunity to direct and produce films and earn additional sums, and most importantly, the opportunity to promote and enhance a career.</p>
<p id="036be4f6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unquestionably, Warner was entitled to reject Locke’s work based on its subjective judgment, and its creative decision in that regard is not subject to being second-guessed by a court. However, bearing in mind the requirement that subjective dissatisfaction must be an honestly held dissatisfaction, the evidence raises a triable issue as to whether Warner breached its agreement with Locke by not considering her proposals on their merits.</p>
<p id="036be4f7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As indicated, the deposition testimony of Joseph Terry recounted a conversation he had with Bob Brassel, a Warner executive, regarding Locke’s projects. In that conversation, Brassel stated “ ‘Joe, we’re not going to work with her,’ and then, ‘That’s Clint’s deal.’ ”</p>
<p id="036be4f8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, the declaration of Mary Wellnitz recalled a conversation she had with Lance Young, a senior vice-president of production at Warner. After discussing the script with Wellnitz, Young told her: “Mary, I want you to know that I think Sondra is a wonderful woman and very talented, but, if you think I can go down the hall and tell Bob Daly that I have a movie I want to make with her he would tell me to forget it.

<p id="036be4f9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The above evidence raises a triable issue of material fact as to whether Warner breached its contract with Locke by categorically refusing to work with her, irrespective of the merits of her proposals. While Warner was entitled to reject Locke’s proposals based on its subjective dissatisfaction, the evidence calls into question whether Warner had an honest or good faith dissatisfaction with Locke’s proposals, or whether it merely went through the motions of purporting to “consider” her projects.</p>

<p id="036be4fb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Warner argues that while the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is implied in all contracts, it is limited to assuring compliance with the express terms of the contract and cannot be extended to create obligations not contemplated in the contract. (Racine &amp; Laramie, Ltd. v. Department of Parks &amp; Recreation (1992) 11 Cal. App. 4th 1026, 1032 [14 Cal. Rptr. 2d 335].)</p>
<p id="036be4fc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This principle is illustrated in Carma Developers (Cal.), Inc. v. Marathon Development California, Inc. (1992) 2 Cal. 4th 342, 351-352 [6 Cal. Rptr. 2d 467, 826 P.2d 710], wherein the parties entered into a lease agreement which stated that if the tenant procured a potential sublessee and asked the landlord for consent to sublease, the landlord had the right to terminate the lease, enter into negotiations with the prospective sublessee, and appropriate for itself all profits from the new arrangement. <i>Carma</i> recognized “[t]he covenant of good faith finds particular application in situations where one party is invested with a discretionary power affecting the rights of another.” (Id., at p. 372.) The court expressed the view that “[s]uch power must be exercised in good faith.” (Ibid.) At the same time, <i>Carma</i> upheld the right of the landlord under the express terms of the lease to freely exercise its discretion to terminate the lease in order to claim for itself — and deprive the tenant of — the appreciated rental value of the premises. (Id., at p. 376.)</p>
<p id="036be4fd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this regard, <i>Carma</i> stated: “We are aware of no reported case in which a court has held the covenant of good faith may be read to prohibit a party from doing that which is expressly permitted by an agreement. On the contrary, as a general matter, implied terms should never be read to vary express terms. ‘The general rule [regarding the covenant of good faith] is plainly subject to the exception that the parties may, by express provisions of the contract, grant the right to engage in the very acts and conduct which would otherwise have been forbidden by an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. . . . This is in accord with the general principle that, in interpreting a contract “an implication . . . should not be made when the contrary is indicated in clear and express words.” 3 Corbin, Contracts, §564, p. 298 (1960). . . . <i>As to acts and conduct authorized by the express provisions of the contract,</i> no covenant of good faith and fair dealing can be implied which forbids such acts and conduct. And if defendants were given the right to do what they did by the express provisions of the contract there can be no breach.’[Citation.]” (Carma Developers (Cal.), Inc. v. Marathon Development California, Inc., supra, 2 Cal. 4th at p. 374, italics added.)</p>
<p id="036be4fe-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Third Story Music, Inc. v. Waits (1995) 41 Cal. App. 4th 798, 801 [48 Cal. Rptr. 2d 747], the issue presented was “whether a promise to market music, or to refrain from doing so, at the election of the promisor is subject to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing where substantial consideration has been paid by the promisor.”</p>
<p id="036be4ff-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In that case, Warner Communications obtained from Third Story Music (TSM) the worldwide right to manufacture, sell, distribute and advertise the musical output of singer/songwriter Tom Waits. (Third Story Music, Inc. v. Waits, supra, 41 Cal. App. 4th at pp. 800-801.) The agreement also specifically <span title="520" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-520">p. 520</span>stated that Warner Communications “ ‘may at our election refrain from any or all of the foregoing.’ ” (Id., at p. 801.) TSM sued Warner Communications for contract damages based on breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, claiming Warner Communications had impeded TSM’s receiving the benefit of the agreement. (Id., at p. 802.) Warner Communications demurred to the complaint, alleging the clause in the agreement permitting it to “ ‘at [its] election refrain’ from doing anything to profitably exploit the music is controlling and precludes application of any implied covenant.” (Ibid.) The demurrer was sustained on those grounds. (Ibid.)</p>
<p id="036be500-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The reviewing court affirmed, holding the implied covenant was unavailing to the plaintiff. (Third Story Music, Inc. v. Waits, supra, 41 Cal. App. 4th at pp. 808-809.) Because the agreement expressly provided Warner Communications had the right to refrain from marketing the Waits recordings, the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing did not limit the discretion given to Warner Communications in that regard. (Ibid.; Carma Developers (Cal.), Inc. v. Marathon Development California, Inc., supra, 2 Cal. 4th at p. 374.)</p>
<p id="036be501-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Warner’s reliance herein on <i>Third Story Music, Inc.,</i> is misplaced. The Locke/Warner agreement did not give Warner the express right to refrain from working with Locke. Rather, the agreement gave Warner <i>discretion</i> with respect to developing Locke’s projects. The implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing obligated Warner to exercise that discretion honestly and in good faith.</p>
<p id="036be502-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, the Warner/Locke agreement contained an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, that neither party would frustrate the other party’s right to receive the benefits of the contract. (Comunale v. Traders &amp; General Ins. Co., supra, 50 Cal. 2d at p. 658; Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc., supra, 11 Cal. 4th at p. 36.) Whether Warner violated the implied covenant and breached the contract by categorically refusing to work with Locke is a question for the trier of fact.</p>
<p id="036be503-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>3. <span class="epub-small-caps">A Triable Issue Exists as to Whether Warner Made a Fraudulent Promise</span></b></p>
<p id="036be504-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the fourth cause of action, Locke pled at the time Warner entered into the agreement with her, it concealed and failed to disclose it had no intention of honoring the agreement.</p>
<p id="036be505-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court held that because Warner did not breach any express or implied obligations owed to Locke, she could not prevail on the fraud claim. However, as explained above, a triable issue exists as to whether Warner breached the agreement with Locke. Therefore, the trial court’s rationale for disposing of the fraud claim is undermined.</p>
<p id="036be506-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court also ruled Locke could not prevail on the fraud claim because there was no evidence Warner had a fraudulent intent at the time the parties entered into the contract. The trial court acknowledged Locke “filed a declaration of her development assistant, Mary Wellnitz, in which Ms. Wellnitz states that a Warner Bros. executive, Lance Young, remarked in late 1992 that Warner Bros. was ‘not going to make a movie’ with Ms. Locke. [Locke] also offered the deposition testimony of a third party, Joe Terry, in which he recalled a 1993 conversation with another Warner Bros. production executive, Bob Brassel, in which Mr. Brassel said that the studio was not going to work with Ms. Locke. <span title="521" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-521">p. 521</span>However, the Court does not believe that these statements would permit a jury to infer that two years earlier, when plaintiffs and the defendant entered into their contract, Warner Bros. intended to breach its obligations.”</p>
<p id="036c0c17-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We disagree. Fraudulent intent must often be established by circumstantial evidence, and may be “inferred from such circumstances as defendant’s . . . failure even to attempt performance, . . .” (Tenzer v. Superscope, Inc., supra, 39 Cal. 3d at p. 30.) Based on the above evidence that Warner had expressed an absolute unwillingness to work with Locke, a trier of fact reasonably could infer Warner never intended to give Locke’s proposals a good faith evaluation and that Warner entered into the agreement with Locke solely as an accommodation to Eastwood, who had promised to reimburse Warner for any losses under the agreement. The trial court erred in concluding such an inference could not be drawn from the evidence. We conclude the issue of fraudulent intent is one for the trier of fact.</p>
<p id="036c0c18-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>4. <span class="epub-small-caps">Locke Waived any Error in the Trial Court’s Ruling with Respect to her Causes of Action Alleging Gender Bias</span></b></p>
<p id="036c0c19-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Locke’s opening brief does not assert any error in the trial court’s disposition of her two causes of action alleging sex discrimination. Accordingly, this court may treat the claims as having been waived.</p>
<p id="036c0c1a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Belatedly, Locke’s reply brief contends she presented evidence which raised the inference she was discriminated against because of her gender. “Ordinarily, [appellants’] failure to raise an issue in their opening brief waives the issue on appeal.

In <i>Morin</i>, we saw the court choosing between an “objective” and a “subjective” standard for the good faith exercise of discretion — between a “reasonable person” standard and one of mere “honesty in fact.” In the <i>Locke</i> case, it appears that defendant Warner Brothers argued that the contract with Locke gave it an absolute right to refrain from <span title="522" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-522">p. 522</span>developing any of Locke’s proposals, so long as it paid her the minimum amounts required by their agreement. Locke on the other hand took the position, accepted by the appellate court, that while their contract gave Warner discretion in deciding whether to proceed with any of her projects, the implied obligation of good faith required at a minimum that it exercise that discretion honestly — that it judge her various proposals on their merits, not simply refuse “categorically” to work with her. Do you agree with the court’s view? What other evidence should Locke be required to produce at trial to establish bad faith on the part of Warner Brothers? Should Warner be required to produce evidence of objective, rational bases for rejecting all of Locke’s proposals? Cf. Dick Broadcasting Co., Inc. of Tennessee v. Oak Ridge FM, Inc., 395 S.W.3d 653 (Tenn. 2013) (holding that the implied covenant of good faith would require that party having right to approve assignment of an asset purchase contract exercise the right in commercially reasonable manner; approving party would not have arbitrary or unfettered discretion absent explicit term to that effect).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="036c3233-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Factual context for</i> Locke. As the court indicated, the <i>Locke</i> case had its beginning in the intimate and professional relationship between actors Sondra Locke and Clint Eastwood. News accounts indicate that the relationship came to an abrupt end when Eastwood had locks changed on the shared home and packed Locke’s belongings while she was away. See generally Ann W. O’Neill, Locke Feels Vindicated After Lawsuit, L.A. Times, Sept. 29, 1996, at A1. Locke originally brought suit against Eastwood in 1989 for a share in the real property and on other theories in what is commonly called a “palimony” lawsuit, similar to that in the <i>Watts</i> case in Chapter 3. As part of a 1990 settlement of the 1989 lawsuit, Eastwood facilitated the $1.5 million three-year development contract between Locke and Warner. In 1994, Locke sued Warner for breach after all her proposals were rejected under the development contract. While pursuing the case against Warner, Locke discovered evidence of the “side-deal” between Warner and Eastwood that required Eastwood to reimburse Warner for its payments to Locke. Locke then initiated a second lawsuit against Eastwood for fraud relating to the Warner contract, seeking recovery for the damage allegedly done to her career. The second Locke-Eastwood lawsuit was settled in 1996 for an undisclosed amount after the jury in the case had begun deliberations. Id. Thus, this action by Locke against Warner constituted the remaining part of the litigation. Note that Restatement (Second) §205, Comment <i>d</i> states that “[s]ubterfuges and evasions violate the obligation of good faith even though the actor believes his conduct to be justified.” Suppose the court had accepted Warner’s contention that the contract (and perhaps industry practice as well) gave it a completely unfettered right to accept or reject Locke’s proposals for whatever reason it chose — indeed, to act for “a good reason, a bad reason, or no reason at all,” as the freedom to be completely arbitrary is often described. Would it necessarily follow that Locke’s suit should fail?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="036c3234-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Gender or racial discrimination as breach of duty of good faith.</i> Locke’s complaint also alleged that Warner denied her the benefits of the contract because of gender bias against women, but Locke’s appellate briefs failed to make a timely challenge to the trial court’s grant of summary judgment on this issue. If Locke had been able to prove that Warner rejected her proposals because of her gender, would that constitute a breach of the implied covenant of good faith? What sort <span title="523" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-523">p. 523</span>of evidence might Locke have been able to produce to prove gender discrimination? Similar questions could be raised whether discrimination in contract performance on the basis of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability would amount to a breach of the duty of good faith, apart from perhaps violating federal or state antidiscrimination statutes. Cf. Doe v. Kohn Nast &amp; Graf, 862 F. Supp. 1310 (E.D. Pa. 1994) (plaintiff alleged discrimination covered by Americans with Disabilities Act on the basis of HIV-infected status and separate claim for breach of implied duty of good faith after being barred from his office; court refused to dismiss good faith issue); Ricci v. Key Bancshares of Maine, Inc., 662 F. Supp. 1132 (1987) (court upheld jury finding of discrimination based on national origin under federal statute and separate claim for breach of implied covenant of good faith in abrupt termination of credit agreement); Rizzitiello v. McDonald’s Corp., 868 A.2d 825 (Del. 2005) (white employee who claimed breach of implied good faith covenant through racial discrimination by black supervisor would need to show disparate treatment on basis of her race; trial court found no evidence of racial animosity).</p>
<p id="036c3235-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professor Steven Burton has taken the position that, while other contract law doctrine may prevent race discrimination in performance of contracts, the implied duty of good faith cannot be used to rule out racially discriminatory conduct. Burton bases this conclusion on the theory that implied terms should rest on the agreement of the parties and, realistically, parties in an “unjust society” might not rule out racial discrimination. Steven J. Burton, Racial Discrimination in Contract Performance: <i>Patterson</i> and a State Law Alternative, 25 Harv. C.R.-C.L. L. Rev. 431, 464 n.116 (1990). In response, Professor Neil Williams asserted that society has reached a consensus, reflected in a number of civil rights laws, that racial discrimination is wrong. In Williams’ view, construing the implied duty of good faith to prohibit racial discrimination would give “effect to the reasonable expectations of the parties that they will not be treated in a manner offensive to prevailing community norms.” Neil G. Williams, Offer, Acceptance, and Improper Considerations: A Common Law Model for the Prohibition of Racial Discrimination in the Contracting Process, 62 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 183, 214 (1994). In a similar vein, Professor Emily Houh has argued that the concept of good faith could be productively applied in the employment context to reach certain types of invidious discriminatory treatment based on factors such as race or gender but not cognizable under existing statutory law. Emily M.S. Houh, Critical Race Realism: Re-Claiming the Antidiscrimination Principle through the Doctrine of Good Faith in Contract Law, 66 U. Pitt. L. Rev. 455 (2005). Would it be consistent with the express terms and implicit understanding of the parties in <i>Locke</i> to imply a term that Warner would not reject Locke’s movie proposals based on her gender?</p></li>

With regard to the plaintiff’s cross appeal, we hold that count two of the plaintiff’s complaint alleging breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing should not have been stricken but that count three alleging wrongful discharge was properly stricken. Accordingly, we reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.</p>
<p id="036c594e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The following procedural history and facts are relevant to this appeal. The defendant is a security services company that provides various protection services to industrial and commercial clients. These services are marketed through employees hired as business development managers (managers) who solicit new business from prospective and existing customers. In August, 2005, the defendant offered the plaintiff an at-will position as a manager. The defendant’s offer letter, which the plaintiff signed in September, 2005, provided that the plaintiff’s compensation was a weekly base salary and commissions on contracts he procured. The offer letter referenced and mirrored the defendant’s 2003 sales incentive plan, which was in effect at the time the plaintiff commenced his employment.</p>
<p id="036c594f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant subsequently amended its sales incentive plan effective December 23, 2006, and revised the commission provision at issue. Section II, part C of the 2006 sales incentive plan regarding sales eligibility requirements provides that “[<i>c</i>]<i>ommission is only paid once work has been performed and invoiced to the client</i>. Upon termination of services to the client all commissions cease, except that commission will be paid up through and including the final invoice. <i>Upon the</i> [<i>manager’s</i>] <i>termination of employment, all commissions cease, except that any commissionable amounts that have been invoiced</i> [<i>to the client</i>] <i>prior to the</i> [<i>manager’s</i>] [<i>t</i>]<i>ermination</i> [<i>d</i>]<i>ate, as defined in</i> [s]ection <i>IV.D, will still be paid commission as part of final pay to the</i> [<i>manager</i>].” (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p id="036c5950-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="525" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-525">p. 525</span>From 2005 to 2008, the plaintiff worked as a manager, on behalf of the defendant, marketing new and supplemental security services to new and existing customers. Based on the applicable sales incentive plan, once the contract was executed and the sales eligibility requirements were satisfied, including invoicing to the client, the plaintiff was entitled to commission payments without having to perform any other work.</p>
<p id="036c5951-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On May 22, 2008, Thomas R. Fagan, the defendant’s regional vice president for human resources, hand delivered a memorandum to the plaintiff terminating his employment. The memorandum explained that the defendant had conducted an investigation into improper business activities that had resulted in significant risk exposure to the defendant and, as a result of the investigation findings, the defendant was terminating the plaintiff’s employment effective May 22, 2008.</p>
<p id="036c5952-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On August 18, 2009, the plaintiff filed a complaint alleging that the defendant violated §31-72, breached his employment contract by violating the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and wrongfully discharged him in violation of public policy. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant’s reasons for his termination “were false and a pretext for nonpayment of owed commissions.” The defendant moved to strike count two, alleging breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and count three, alleging wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. Relying on <i>Burnham v. Karl &amp; Gelb, P.C.</i>, 252 Conn. 153, 745 A.2d 178 (2000), the trial court granted the defendant’s motion to strike both counts because it believed the plaintiff had an adequate statutory remedy under §31-72. See id., 161-62 (holding that even if plaintiff’s termination violated public policy embodied in statute, plaintiff’s wrongful discharge claim would be precluded due to existence of statutory remedy under that statute). The trial court then rendered a partial judgment for the defendant on the two stricken counts.</p>
<p id="036c5953-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before trial, the parties agreed that “the plaintiff’s claim hinges on whether or not the language in the defendant’s sales incentive plan, which provides that the right to commissions ceases upon the plaintiff’s termination of employment, is enforceable.” Therefore, the trial court agreed to decide the enforceability question and, in order to facilitate the trial court’s determination, the parties entered into a stipulation of facts dated March 1, 2012.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN107D8_2c3aa386-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N107D8_2c3aa386-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">6</a></span></p>
<p id="036c5955-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court determined that, because the plaintiff’s right to commissions was not contingent upon his providing any further services to the defendant’s customers, he had fully earned his commissions when his employment was terminated. Thus, the trial court found that since the provision in the sales incentive plan deprived him of those earned commissions, resulted in forfeiture of wages, and applied even to an employee who is terminated for no cause, the provision was unenforceable because it “violate[d] two public policies: the first, <span title="526" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-526">p. 526</span>which strongly favors the payment of wages, and the second, which disfavors forfeitures.”</p>
<p id="036c5956-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On October 16, 2014, the parties stipulated to a judgment in favor of the plaintiff for unpaid commissions pursuant to §31-72, but preserved their respective rights to appeal. The defendant appealed from the stipulated judgment and the plaintiff cross appealed. We now turn to the merits of those appeals.</p>
<p id="036c5957-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>I</b></p>
<p id="036c5958-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We first address the defendant’s claim that the commission provision was not void on public policy grounds and, therefore, the failure to pay the plaintiff’s commissions was not a violation of §31-72. We begin by setting out the applicable standard of review and relevant legal principles. “Although it is well established that parties are free to contract for whatever terms on which they may agree . . . it is equally well established that contracts that violate public policy are unenforceable. . . . [T]he question [of] whether a contract is against public policy is [a] question of law dependent on the circumstances of the particular case, over which an appellate court has unlimited review.” (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <i>. . .</i></p>
<p id="036c8069-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . If a contract violates public policy, this would be a ground to not enforce the contract. . . . A contract . . . however, does not violate public policy just because the contract was made unwisely. . . . [C]ourts do not unmake bargains unwisely made. <i>. . .</i></p>
<p id="036c806a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the commission provision at issue acts to negate the wage statutes, however, the provision violates public policy. See <i>Parente v. Pirozzoli</i>, 87 Conn. App. 235, 246, 866 A.2d 629 (2005) “Generally, agreements contrary to public policy, that is those that negate laws enacted for the common good, are illegal and therefore unenforceable. . . . Agreements that are legal on their face, yet which are designed to evade statutory requirements, are routinely held unenforceable.” [Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]). We must initially determine, therefore, whether the commission provision violates the wage statutes.</p>
<p id="036c806b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have held that §31-72 “does not embody substantive standards to determine the amount of wages that are payable but provides penalties in order to deter employers from deferring wage payments once they have accrued. Section 31-72 is, therefore, a remedial statute rather than one creating independent substantive rights. . . .” (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <i>Mytych v. May Dept. Stores Co.</i>, 260 Conn. 152, 162, 793 A.2d 1068 (2002). . . . </p>
<p id="036c806c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Mytych</i> [v. <i>May Dept. Stores Co.</i>, supra, 260 Conn. 156], [the court] considered the question of whether the defendant employer’s practice of calculating the plaintiff employees’ sales commissions by deducting from their respective gross sales figures a pro rata share of unidentified returns . . . violated a statutory provision disallowing unauthorized deductions from wages.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1081A_2c3aa386-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1081A_2c3aa386-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">7</a></span> . . . <span title="527" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-527">p. 527</span>The court held that it did not, as the Connecticut wage statutes left the substantive standards for the determination of wages to the agreement between the employer and the employee. Id. Specifically, the court held that “the formula by which an employee’s wage is calculated is determined by the agreement between the employer and the employee”; <i>Mytych v. May Dept. Stores Co.</i>, supra, 160; because the definition of wages “expressly [left] the determination of the wage to the employer-employee agreement, assuming some specific conditions, such as a minimum hourly wage, are met.” Id., 163.</p>
<p id="036c806e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court in <i>Mytych</i> then explicitly rejected the plaintiffs’ reasoning that their wages accrued at the time they rendered their services by making sales because, while the California case cited by the plaintiffs relied “on a long history of California case law and regulatory opinions establishing that an employee’s right to a commission accrues or vests at the time of the actual sale . . . [i]n Connecticut, there [was] no such settled doctrine regarding the time at which an employee’s rights to his wages vests and, in fact, we [had] concluded [t]herein that <i>our wage payment statutes expressly leave the timing of accrual to the determination of the wage agreement between the employer and</i> [<i>the</i>] <i>employee</i>.” (Emphasis added.) Id., 164-65. . . . </p>
<p id="036c806f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With these applicable legal principles in mind, we now address whether the commission provision in the present case violates public policy and the wage statutes. The court in <i>Mytych</i> clearly addressed the timing of wage accrual and left the determination of this matter to the employment agreement. See <i>Mytych v. May Dept. Stores Co.</i>, supra, 260 Conn. 164-65. Additionally, in <i>Mytych</i>, this court specifically rejected the doctrine that an employee’s right to wages necessarily accrued at the time of sale. In the present case, on the basis of the clear language of the commission provision, invoicing prior to the plaintiff’s termination is a condition precedent to earning the commission. . . . Thus, we agree with the defendant that the commissions were not “due” within the meaning of General Statutes 31-71b(a) because there was a condition precedent to their accrual that had not been satisfied. Nevertheless, the plaintiff contends that the commission provision should not be enforceable because he did not have to provide any further services to the defendant’s customers and, therefore, he had fully earned his commissions under the wage statutes.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10845_2c3aa386-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10845_2c3aa386-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">10</a></span></p>
<p id="036c8071-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Mytych v. May Dept. Stores Co.</i>, supra, 260 Conn. 163-64 and n.7, however, the employees did not have to provide any additional services and this court still held that their wages had not accrued at the time of sale. . . see also <i>Mullowney v. Data General Corp.</i>, 143 F.3d 1081, 1083 (7th Cir. 1998) (applying Massachusetts law and finding that, although there was certainly risk that employee could lose commissions on some sales for which he was primarily responsible based on at-will agreement where employee would be entitled to commissions only on those sales invoiced or shipped before his termination became effective, “[t]his was <span title="528" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-528">p. 528</span>the bargain he made . . . he cannot now . . . be heard to complain because [the employer] adhered to this arrangement”) . . . . </p>
<p id="036ca782-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the basis of our review of Connecticut law and the public policy of freedom of contract reflected in our common law, we do not believe that this commission provision on its face “negate[s] laws enacted for the common good” or is “designed to evade statutory requirements. . . .” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <i>Parente v. Pirozzoli</i>, supra, 87 Conn. App. 246. We conclude, therefore, that the contract provision providing that commissions will be paid only if the work had been invoiced prior to termination of the employee does not violate public policy and is enforceable. Because the plaintiff was not due his commissions under the express and enforceable terms of his agreement with the defendant, and the agreement does not violate public policy, we hold that there was no violation of the wage statutes.</p>

Anaconda Industries, Inc.</i>, 193 Conn. 558, 479 A.2d 781 (1984), this court addressed the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in employment contracts. The plaintiff in that case contended that the good faith principle was applicable and subjected the employer to liability whenever an employee is discharged without just cause. Id., 567. For guidance, the court looked to Massachusetts cases applying the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the employment context. Id., 569-71. While the court recognized the applicability of the covenant of good faith to employment contracts, it concluded that a breach of such an implied covenant cannot be predicated simply upon the absence of good cause for discharge. Id., 571-72. The court specifically declined the plaintiff’s invitation “to transform the requirement of good faith into an implied condition that an employee may be dismissed only for good cause.” Id., 571; see also . . . <i>Morris v. Hartford Courant Co.</i>, 200 Conn. 676, 679 n.2, 513 A.2d 66 (1986). In <i>Magnan</i>, the court left for another day the determination of the applicability of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing to a discharge that was motivated by an intent to deprive an employee of clearly identifiable compensation related to past services. See <i>Magnan v. Anaconda Industries, Inc.</i>, supra, 573. As such, the court acknowledged, but did not fully consider, the Massachusetts case of <i>Fortune v. National Cash Register Co.</i>, 373 Mass. 96, 364 N.E.2d 1251 (1977). See <i>Magnan v. Anaconda Industries, Inc.</i>, supra, 570 n.20, 571.</p>

The court acknowledged that “an employer is entitled to be motivated by and to serve its own legitimate business interests; that an employer must have wide latitude in deciding whom it will employ in the face of the uncertainties of the business world; and that an employer needs flexibility in the face of changing circumstances.” Id., 101-102. Nevertheless, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that the employer’s written contract contained an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and that, in a situation where commissions are to be paid for work performed by the employee, a bad faith termination constituted a breach of that contract.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN108C3_2c3aa386-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N108C3_2c3aa386-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">12</a></span> Id.</p>

<li class=""><p id="036cf5c2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Presumption of employment at-will and its limitations.</i> The “at-will” doctrine is a concept that we have encountered before. You should recall from the <i>Leibel</i> case earlier in this chapter that a franchise contract of indefinite duration is presumed to be at-will, meaning that either party is free to terminate the contract at any time and without a requirement of good or just cause. Application of the at-will doctrine to employment contracts in the United States has been traced back to the nineteenth century and is the prevailing rule throughout <span title="534" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-534">p. 534</span>the country. See Restatement of Employment Law §2.01, Comment <i>b</i> (2015) (noting that 49 states and District of Columbia recognize at-will employment as presumptive rule; sole exception is Montana, which has a “good cause” rule by statute).</p>
<p id="036cf5c3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By definition, the at-will doctrine does not apply to a contract with a specified duration, e.g., a one-year or five-year contract. A contract that includes a specified duration is construed to mean that the employee may be terminated only for just or good cause. See, e.g., Mart v. Forest River, Inc., 854 F. Supp. 2d 577 (N.D. Ind. 2012) (discussing two types of employment contracts under Indiana law—definite term in which the employee may only be fired for cause and at-will in which the employee may be fired regardless of reason). The presumption of at-will employment, however, cannot be easily overcome and therefore an agreement for a term must be specific. See Bernard v. IMI Systems, Inc., 618 A.2d 338 (N.J. 1993) (overruling judicial precedent that salary stated in annual terms would implicitly create a year-long contract; more required to overcome at-will presumption). But see Rooney v. Tyson, 697 N.E.2d 571 (N.Y. 1998) (agreement to employ fight trainer “for as long as [defendant] fought professionally” established legally cognizable duration and was not contract subject to termination at-will).</p>
<p id="036cf5c4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, if the contract is for “permanent employment” or similar language, courts steeped in the traditional approach to at-will employment contracts have routinely held that permanent employment does not mean employment “for life,” merely that the employee’s position will be of indefinite duration. See Reddington v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., 511 F.3d 126 (2d Cir. 2007) (finding that statements made to hospital employee that new position would “always” be available did not overcome presumption that employment was at-will). Even if interpreted literally, promises of “permanent” employment have customarily been held to be unenforceable unless supported by some additional consideration beyond the employee’s performance of her duties on the job. See, e.g., Worley v. Wyoming Bottling Co., 1 P.3d 615 (Wyo. 2000). On the other hand, if the employee truly provides additional consideration for the employment, such additional consideration may be sufficient to require the employer to have good cause for termination. See NRG Solutions v. Neurogistics Corp., 2011 WL 1118838 (N.D. Ill.) (plaintiff adequately pled additional consideration to overcome at-will presumption in that she agreed to transfer assets of business she owned, including client database, to new employer and became full-time employee). For such courts, the role of extra consideration is to indicate the parties’ intent to have a more lasting relationship than a presumed at-will contract. See, e.g., Ciardi v. Laurel Media Inc., 2012 WL 70656 (W.D. Pa.).</p></li>

The court relies on a line of cases in which employers have been held liable to employees for breach of the implied duty of good faith by intentionally discharging the employee <span title="535" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-535">p. 535</span>for the purpose of depriving the employee of compensation that the employee had already earned or was on the verge of doing so. The leading case is Fortune v. National Cash Register Co., 364 N.E.2d 1251 (Mass. 1977) (discharge motivated by desire to deny plaintiff the benefit of a sales commission that had been earned in full would be breach of duty of good faith). See also Wilson v. Career Educ. Corp., 729 F.3d 665 (7th Cir. 2013) (employer may breach covenant of good faith by using its discretion to terminate bonus plan with intent to deprive employee commission already earned).</p>
<p id="036cf5c6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The duty of good faith might also apply to the manner in which an at-will employee is terminated. See E. I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Pressman, 679 A.2d 436 (Del. 1996) (breach of the implied covenant of good faith would be established by proving that employer created false grounds and fictitious basis for termination of at-will employee but not by the termination itself).</p>
<p id="036cf5c7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, as the <i>Geysen</i> court holds the implied covenant of good faith will not transform an at-will employment relationship into one that requires good cause for discharge. See also Bollinger v. Fall River Rural Elec. Co-op., Inc., 272 P.3d 1263 (Idaho 2012). Furthermore, some jurisdictions take the position that the implied duty of good faith simply does not apply in at-will employment relationships. See Campeggi v. Arche Inc., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124814 at *17 (S.D.N.Y.) (“well-settled New York law holds that no implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing attaches to at-will employment contracts”).</p>
<p id="036cf5c8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Geysen court clearly holds that the implied duty of good faith would not prevent the employer from discharging the at-will employee, but would place some limit on the timing and purpose of termination. Are you persuaded, however, that the court made a meaningful distinction between wages “earned,” as permissibly defined by the contract under the statute, and wages “owed” which would be protected from a bad faith termination, as suggested by footnote 15 in the opinion?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="036cf5c9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Public policy exception to at-will doctrine.</i> The <i>Geysen</i> court along with a clear majority of jurisdictions recognize a public policy exception to the at-will employment doctrine and often treat such claims as sounding in tort. See Wholey v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 803 A.2d 482, 488-489 (Md. 2002) (citing 30 jurisdictions recognizing public policy exception in nonexhaustive listing). The decision usually regarded as the leading case applying the public policy limitation is Petermann v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, 344 P.2d 25 (Cal. Ct. App. 1959), which held that an at-will employee would be entitled to relief for wrongful discharge if he were fired because he refused to commit perjury at the request of his employer. See also Thompson v. St. Regis Paper Co., 685 P.2d 1081 (Wash. 1984) (employee’s discharge would be tortious if based on steps taken to comply with anti-bribery measures in Foreign Corrupt Practices Act).</p>
<p id="036cf5ca-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As indicated by <i>Geysen</i>, however, courts generally restrict this theory to circumstances involving a “clear mandate” of public policy founded on constitutional, legislative, administrative, or established judicial authority. Courts will, of course, differ on when a “clear mandate” exists. Compare Moore v. Warr Acres Nursing Ctr., LLC, 376 P.3d 894 (Oklahoma 2016) (given state <span title="536" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-536">p. 536</span>and federal health codes prohibiting nurses from working while infected with influenza, it would violate public policy to terminate a licensed practical nurse for missing work in a nursing center based on vomiting on the job and a doctor’s note stating that the employee should not work) with Dukowitz v. Hannon Sec. Servs., 841 N.W.2d 147 (Minn. 2014) (because Minnesota recognizes a common-law cause of action for wrongful discharge only as to discharges resulting from an employee’s good-faith refusal to violate the law, the public-policy exception to the employment-at-will rule did not apply to a termination alleged to have been in retaliation for an employee’s application for unemployment benefits when a temporary assignment ended). Further, some jurisdictions have rejected the public policy limitation altogether. See, e.g., De Petris v. Union Settlement Ass’n, Inc., 657 N.E.2d 269 (N.Y. 1995) (confirming that New York does not recognize a tort of wrongful discharge in at-will employment).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="036cf5cb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Other exceptions to the employment-at-will doctrine: employee handbooks and promissory estoppel.</i> Yet another exception to the at-will presumption is found in cases recognizing a cause of action for breach of contract when the defendant employer had committed itself, by public statements in personnel manuals or otherwise, to refrain from terminating employees except for good cause. A leading decision in this area is Toussaint v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield, 292 N.W.2d 880 (Mich. 1980), in which the employee received assurance of job security before accepting employment and the company manual stated there would be dismissal only for cause. The court deemed the company’s statement to create an “implied-in-fact” term that the employee would be discharged only for cause. Id. at 894. Not all courts agree, however, that statements of job security made in policy manuals are contractually binding. See, e.g., Fleming v. AT&amp;T Info. Services, Inc., 878 F.2d 1472, 1474 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (company’s written policies of treating employees fairly and of providing post-termination counseling are “irrelevant” in determining whether the employee is hired at-will). It should be noted that most large employers who are well-counseled by their employment lawyers will typically have strong disclaimer language in their employment manuals and handbooks, and courts have generally held that such disclaimers constitute a defense against liability based on a claim arising from the employee handbook. See Collins v. City of Newton, 240 So. 3d 1211, 1217-1220 (Miss. 2018). But see Silchia v. MCI Telcoms. Corp., 942 F. Supp. 1369, 1375 (D. Colo. 1996) (“Even if there is a valid employment-at-will disclaimer in an employment handbook, an employer may nevertheless be found to have manifested an intent to be bound by its terms if the handbook contains mandatory termination procedures or requires ‘just cause’ for termination.”).</p>
<p id="036cf5cc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some courts have also held that detrimental reliance by a discharged employee may serve as a basis for relief. See Sheppard v. Morgan-Keegan, 266 Cal. Rptr. 784 (Ct. App. 1990) (employee who resigned a position and moved across country would not expect to be terminated before he had a chance to perform in job; summary judgment for employer reversed, citing promissory <span title="537" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-537">p. 537</span>estoppel as well as the implied covenant of good faith); Nelson v. Town of Johnsbury Selectboard, 115 A.3d 423 (Vt. 2015) (promissory estoppel may modify at-will relationship, but promise must be definite and specific in nature and not just vague assurance); Restatement of Employment Law §2.02(b). On the other hand, a number of jurisdictions have held that a promissory estoppel claim by an employee is fundamentally inconsistent with at-will status. See, e.g., Krueger v. Home Depot USA, Inc., 2015 WL 4763653 (W.D. Ky.) (at-will status precludes promissory estoppel claim under Kentucky law).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="036cf5cd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>At-will doctrine and personnel actions other than discharge.</i> If a court recognizes restrictions on an employer’s right to discharge an at-will employee, will such limitations also apply to demotions or other changes in employment conditions? Compare Scott v. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., 904 P.2d 834 (Cal. 1995) (extending policy manual exception to demotions), with White v. State of Washington, 929 P.2d 396 (Wash. 1997) (refusing to extend public policy exception to employer’s personnel actions that are less than discharge).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="036d1cde-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>At-will employment and ethical duties of lawyers.</i> Termination of at-will employees may raise additional questions when the party terminated is an attorney. In Wieder v. Skala, 609 N.E.2d 105 (N.Y. 1992), the New York Court of Appeals ruled that an associate attorney’s employment contract with a law firm should be read to implicitly incorporate certain ethical standards of the profession, such as the duty to report suspected unfitness of other attorneys. Thus, the court found a termination wrongful when the plaintiff associate was discharged for reporting another attorney’s misconduct. But see Bohatch v. Butler &amp; Binion, 977 S.W.2d 543 (Tex. 1998) (law firm could not be held liable in damages for wrongful expulsion of partner who alleged in good faith that another partner engaged in unethical conduct). <i>Wieder</i> and <i>Bohatch</i> both involved lawyers in private firms who were discharged because they reported misconduct by other attorneys. Lawyers employed by private corporations rather than law firms have also brought wrongful discharge claims. Compare General Dynamics Corp. v. Superior Court, 876 P.2d 487 (Cal. 1994) (recognizing right of in-house counsel to bring claim for wrongful discharge based on public policy and implied contract theories), with Balla v. Gambro, Inc., 584 N.E.2d 104 (Ill. 1991) (in-house counsel did not have cause of action against employer for wrongful discharge when employer fired him after he threatened to take whatever action was necessary to prevent company from selling defective kidney dialysis machines).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="036d1cdf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Scholarly analysis.</i> What interests are at stake in cases involving the employment-at-will rule? Many legal scholars have advocated a change in the at-will doctrine to benefit employees based on the individual’s interest in freedom from unjust discharge, along with the public’s interest in a securely employed labor force. See, e.g., Cynthia L. Estlund, Wrongful Discharge Protections in an At-Will World, 74 Tex. L. Rev. 1655 (1996). Professor Matthew Bodie has proposed that courts recognize a new exception to the at-will rule, the “personal-autonomy” exception, meaning that an implied term of every employment contract should be that employers agree not to take any action <span title="538" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-538">p. 538</span>against an employee based on the employee’s personal autonomy, so long as that autonomy does not interfere with the employer’s business or reputation. Employee personal autonomy includes political affiliations, religious observance, and recreational activities. Matthew T. Bodie, The Best Way Out is Always Through: Changing The Employment At-Will Default Rule to Protect Personal Autonomy, 2017 U. Ill. L. Rev. 223.</p>
<p id="036d1ce0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other writers have argued in favor of the employment at-will rule on grounds of efficiency. Limitations on an employer’s right of discharge increase litigation costs and may harm employees as a class by making employers more reluctant to hire risky employees. See Richard A. Epstein, In Defense of the Contract At Will, 51 U. Chi. L. Rev. 947 (1984). See also John P. Frantz, Market Ordering Versus Statutory Control of Termination Decisions: A Case for the Inefficiency of Just Cause Dismissal Requirements, 20 Harv. J.L. &amp; Pub. Poly. 555 (1997); Andrew P. Morriss, Bad Data, Bad Economics, and Bad Policy: Time to Fire the Wrongful Discharge Law, 74 Tex. L. Rev. 1901 (1996).</p>
<p id="036d1ce1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A rebuttal to the efficiency arguments can be found in Peter Linzer, The Decline of Assent: At-Will Employment as a Case Study of the Breakdown of Private Law Theory, 20 Ga. L. Rev. 323, 409-415 (1986). Professor Linzer asserts that many attempts by the courts to ground relief against wrongful discharge on one of the traditional common law bases — contract or tort — are not entirely convincing and that the traditional subject-area divisions should not be controlling. Id. at 335-369. Relying on a variety of strands of theory (including modern notions of “the firm” and the “relational contract” theories of Professor Ian Macneil), Linzer argues that relief from improper discharge in many cases is appropriate and, moreover, that the courts, and not merely the legislatures, are appropriate organs for creating such rules of relief.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="036d1ce2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I think it can even be argued that courts are institutionally at least as capable as legislatures to apply community values to problems of private law. Courts — at least Anglo-American courts — have done this as long as there have been courts. Certainly they can easily get out of touch, and in any event we are not speaking of a Gallup Poll. But judges seeking a policy basis will be affected by the attitudes of the time, as well as by their own ethical, economic, social and political biases. Legislators hear from constituents and lobbyists, but with many private law matters they are likely to be importuned more loudly, and to hear more clearly, after the courts have acted rather than while the issue is “abstract” and unresolved.</p>
</div>
<p id="036d1ce3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Id. at 423. Noting that “inaction” is action that preserves the employer-dominant power regime, Linzer concludes by calling on courts to return to “common law creativity” by discerning and applying community values in this and other areas where traditional common law rules appear inadequate. Id. at 424. Linzer also urges courts to recognize that “all contributors to an enterprise deserve some security and some share of the enterprise itself.” Id. at 425.

<p id="036d1ce6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ed Evers owned an accounting company in Santa Carlita, your city. Last January, Ed was approached by Fran Farmer of Acme Accountants, a large accounting firm with a number of branch offices in Santa Carlita and neighboring communities. Fran suggested that Ed come to work for Acme as a manager. “You’ll be paid a salary plus commissions,” Fran told Ed, “and I’m sure you’ll make more money than you’re making now.” “That’s tempting,” Ed responded, “I plan to retire in five years or so, and it sure would be nice to get rid of the headache of running my own business in the meantime. But I averaged $10,000 per month in profits over the last five years. Can you match that?” Fran said, “Come with us and you should do even better than that, no question about it.”</p>
<p id="036d1ce7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ed then notified his clients that he was closing his business and would start work for Acme on February 1. On his first day at Acme, Ed completed a one-page employment form that stated that he would be on “probation status” for three months and then would become a “permanent employee.” Just above the signature block was a clause that read, “This form is the entire employment agreement of the parties.” The personnel officer told Ed the form was mandatory and was used only to initiate the company benefit programs.</p>
<p id="036d1ce8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ed was assigned to manage the largest Acme branch office in downtown Santa Carlita. Business at the branch grew steadily as Ed’s old clients brought their work to that location. Ed was paid a base salary of $10,000 and commissions of about $3,000 each month during the first three months. Although pleased with his income, Ed also became concerned because Acme charged a 20 percent fee to customers who took “instant payment” of their income tax refunds. Ed told Fran on April 30 that this fee was too high, as the market rate was only 10 percent for that service; clients might be put off, he argued, and go elsewhere. Fran said she would reconsider the fee.</p>
<p id="036d1ce9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Shortly after joining Acme, Ed also began to have lunch on a regular basis and go out on dates after hours with a coworker, Andy Lee. On May 1, Fran stopped Ed as he returned from lunch with Andy and told Ed that intra-office romantic relationships were strictly forbidden. Ed responded that he had meticulously avoided socializing with Andy during business hours and would continue to do so, but that he intended to continue to see Andy for lunch and on his own time. One week later, Ed received Acme’s “Manager of the Month” award for April. On May 15, Fran gave notice to Ed that he was being reassigned to a small Acme branch in the suburbs as a tax preparer, and would receive a $6,000 monthly base salary plus commissions.</p>
<p id="036d1cea-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ed comes to your office today very upset. He believes Fran reassigned him either because of his complaint about the “instant payment” fee or because of his relationship with Andy. Ed tells you that although he is a new Acme employee, he is familiar with Acme practices over the past ten years, and that over that time period only two managers have been demoted or terminated, both of whom were found to have inflated their monthly commissions with false numbers. Ed wants to know whether he has any claim against Fran or Acme, and what issues would likely arise in an action against them.

Ms. Glazier’s sister, Ruth, was married several years ago to Francis Fallon; Ruth and her husband have recently returned to Center City to live, following his retirement from the United States Navy. Although Mr. Fallon retired with full pension rights, he is still a relatively young man (48), with two children aged 13 and 16, and wants to establish himself in some business enterprise in order to meet the expenses (which he foresees as substantial) of his children’s education and also to hedge against inflation and consequent devaluation in the purchasing power of his pension payments. He has saved a substantial sum from his Navy pay over the years and is willing to invest all or most of it in a promising opportunity.</p>
<p id="036d4408-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recently Mr. Fallon purchased, at a favorable price, a corner lot on Maple Avenue, near the city limits, with a small building on it in which the previous owner had operated a food market. Believing this location to be ideal for the operation of a small luncheonette/bakery shop, Fallon has been discussing with representatives of Captain Donut, Inc. (a nationwide franchisor of doughnut shops) the possibility of opening a Captain Donut shop in the building on his Maple Avenue lot. He has, he tells you, been assured by them that his store building can be converted to the standard Captain Donut format with remodeling and equipment costs of probably no more than $80,000, and that (based on figures from comparable locations in your state) a shop at that location should — after an initial period of operation, and with efficient management — earn for its owner a net profit of $85,000 a year, or more.

<p id="036db95a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This section examines “warranties.” In common usage a warranty is a guarantee of quality of a product or service for a specified period of time. As we will see warranties can arise by statute, by contract, and by common law decision.</p>
<p id="036db95b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Uniform Commercial Code recognizes several forms of warranties. UCC §2-313 deals with creation of “express warranties.” Notably, the section does not require that the seller have the intent to create an express warranty, and this represents a substantial change from the common law approach to warranties. See the Comment on the History of Warranty Law following the <i>Bayliner</i> case. The most common application of this section is the written or oral express warranty given by a seller or manufacturer of a consumer product (an automobile or a washing machine, for example), concerning the quality or nature of the goods (for example, “the car will get at least 25 miles per gallon of gas” or “this tractor is a 1999 model”).</p>
<p id="036db95c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">UCC §2-314 sets forth a second type of warranty — the “implied warranty of merchantability.” Under this warranty a “merchant” (see UCC §2-104) who regularly sells goods of a particular kind impliedly warrants to the buyer that the goods are of good quality and are fit for the ordinary purposes for which they are used.</p>
<p id="036db95d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">UCC §2-315 defines a third type of warranty, the “implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.” This warranty differs from the implied warranty of merchantability in several respects. To begin with, the warranty is created only when the buyer relies on the seller’s skill or judgment to select suitable goods and the seller has reason to know of this reliance. Further, breach of the warranty does not require a showing that the goods are defective in any way — merely that the goods are not fit for the buyer’s particular purpose.</p>
<p id="036db95e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Claims of implied warranty, however, are often made in non-UCC transactions. For example, in the leading case of Javins v. First National Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 400 U.S. 925 (1970), the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that a warranty of <span title="547" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-547">p. 547</span>habitability would be implied into leases of urban dwelling units. In his opinion, Judge J. Skelly Wright observed that the common law rule absolving the lessor of all obligation to repair had developed during the early Middle Ages in an era when the land was more important than the simple structure that might be included in the leasehold, and at a time when tenants were deemed fully capable of making repairs. Judge Wright then asserted that in more modern times, with more complex structures, tenants are primarily interested in having a dwelling that is suitable for occupation and are more dependent on landlords to maintain the condition of a building. Finally, he noted that there exists a well-documented inequality in bargaining power between landlord and tenant that tends to leave tenants with “little leverage” in negotiating for better housing. Id. at 1077-1080.</p>
<p id="036db95f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The overwhelming majority of states now recognizes an implied warranty of habitability in residential leases, by virtue of legislative or judicial action. See Barbara Jo Smith, Note: Tenants in Search of Parity with Consumers: Creating a Reasonable Expectations Warranty, 72 Wash. U. L.Q. 475 (1994). Many of the statutory provisions have been influenced by the Uniform Residential Landlord Tenant Act adopted by the American Law Institute in 1972. Section 2.104 of that Act accepts the concept of the warranty of habitability and defines the landlord’s obligation as follows:</p>

<p id="036e078f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this appeal, the dispositive issue is whether there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court’s ruling that the manufacturer of a sport fishing boat breached an express warranty and implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.</p>
<p id="036e0790-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the summer of 1989, John R. Crow was invited by John Atherton, then a sales representative for Tidewater Yacht Agency, Inc. (Tidewater), to ride on a new model sport fishing boat known as a 3486 Trophy Convertible, manufactured by Bayliner Marine Corporation (Bayliner). At that time, Tidewater was the exclusive authorized dealer in southeastern Virginia for this model Bayliner boat. During an excursion lasting about 20 minutes, Crow piloted the boat for a short period of time but was not able to determine its speed because there was no equipment on board for such testing.</p>
<p id="036e0791-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When Crow asked Atherton about the maximum speed of the boat, Atherton explained that he had no personal experience with the boat or information from other customers concerning the boat’s performance. Therefore, Atherton consulted two documents described as “prop matrixes,” which were included by Bayliner in its dealer’s manual.</p>
<p id="036e0792-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Atherton gave Crow copies of the “prop matrixes,” which listed the boat models offered by Bayliner and stated the recommended propeller sizes, gear ratios, and engine sizes for each model. The “prop matrixes” also listed the maximum speed for each model. The 3486 Trophy Convertible was listed as having a maximum speed of 30 miles per hour when equipped with a size “20 × 20” or “20[×]19” propeller. The boat Crow purchased did not have either size propeller but, instead, had a size “20 × 17” propeller.</p>
<p id="036e0793-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the bottom of one of the “prop matrixes” was the following disclaimer: “This data is intended for comparative purposes only, and is available without reference to weather conditions or other variables. All testing was done at or near sea level, with full fuel and water tanks, and approximately 600 lb. passenger and gear weight.”</p>

<p id="036e0797-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Atherton also showed Crow a Bayliner brochure describing the 1989 boat models, including the 3486 Trophy Convertible. The brochure included a picture of that model fully rigged for offshore fishing, accompanied by the statement that this model “delivers the kind of performance you need to get to the prime offshore fishing grounds.”</p>
<p id="036e0798-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In August 1989, Crow entered into a written contract for the purchase of the 3486 Trophy Convertible in which he <span title="549" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-549">p. 549</span>had ridden. The purchase price was $120,000, exclusive of taxes. The purchase price included various equipment to be installed by Tidewater including a generator, a cockpit cover, a “Bimini top,” a winch, a spotlight, radar, a navigation system, an icemaker, fishing outriggers, an automatic pilot system, extra fuel gauges, a second radio, and air conditioning and heating units. The total weight of the added equipment was about 2,000 pounds. Crow did not test drive the boat after the additional equipment was installed or at any other time prior to taking delivery.</p>
<p id="036e0799-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When Crow took delivery of the boat in September 1989, he piloted it onto the Elizabeth River. He noticed that the boat’s speed measuring equipment, which was installed in accordance with the contract terms, indicated that the boat’s maximum speed was 13 miles per hour. Crow immediately returned to Tidewater and reported the problem.</p>
<p id="036e079a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During the next 12 to 14 months, while Crow retained ownership and possession of the boat, Tidewater made numerous repairs and adjustments to the boat in an attempt to increase its speed capability. Despite these efforts, the boat consistently achieved a maximum speed of only 17 miles per hour, except for one period following an engine modification when it temporarily reached a speed of about 24 miles per hour. In July 1990, a representative from Bayliner wrote Crow a letter stating that the performance representations made at the time of purchase were incorrect, and that 23 to 25 miles per hour was the maximum speed the boat could achieve.</p>
<p id="036e079b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1992, Crow filed a motion for judgment against Tidewater, Bayliner, and Brunswick Corporation, the manufacturer of the boat’s diesel engines.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C49_2c3aa386-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10C49_2c3aa386-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">1</a></span> Crow alleged, among other things, that Bayliner breached express warranties, and implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.</p>
<p id="036e2ead-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At a bench trial in 1994, Crow, Atherton, and Gordon W. Shelton, III, Tidewater’s owner, testified that speed is a critical quality in boats used for offshore sport fishing in the Tidewater area of Virginia because of the distance between the coast and the offshore fishing grounds. According to these witnesses, a typical offshore fishing site in that area is 90 miles from the coast. Therefore, the speed at which the boat can travel to and from fishing sites has a major impact on the amount of time left in a day for fishing.</p>
<p id="036e2eae-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Crow testified that because of the boat’s slow speed, he could not use the boat for offshore fishing, that he had no other use for it, and that he would not have purchased the boat if he had known that its maximum speed was 23 to 25 miles per hour. Crow testified that he had not used the boat for fishing since 1991 or 1992. He admitted, however, that between September 1989, and September 1994, the boat’s engines had registered about 850 hours of use. Bob Schey, Bayliner’s manager of yacht testing, testified that a pleasure boat in a climate such as Virginia’s typically would register 150 engine hours per year.</p>
<p id="036e2eaf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court entered judgment in favor of Crow against Bayliner on the counts of breach of express warranty and breach of implied warranties of <span title="550" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-550">p. 550</span>merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The court awarded Crow damages of $135,000, plus prejudgment interest from June 1993. The court explained that the $135,000 award represented the purchase price of the boat, and about $15,000 in “damages” for a portion of the expenses Crow claimed in storing, maintaining, insuring, and financing the boat.</p>
<p id="036e2eb0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On appeal, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to Crow, the prevailing party at trial. Tuomala v. Regent University, 252 Va. 368, 375, 477 S.E.2d 501, 505 (1996); W.S. Carnes, Inc. v. Board of Supervisors of Chesterfield County, 252 Va. 377, 385, 478 S.E.2d 295, 301 (1996). We will uphold the trial court’s judgment unless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. Code §8.01-680; Horton v. Horton, 254 Va. 111, 115, 487 S.E.2d 200, 203 (1997).</p>
<p id="036e2eb1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Crow argues that the “prop matrixes” he received created an express warranty by Bayliner that the boat he purchased was capable of a maximum speed of 30 miles per hour. We disagree.</p>
<p id="036e2eb2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Code §8.2-313 provides, in relevant part:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="036e2eb3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Express warranties by the seller are created as follows:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-parenlistlcletter">
<li class=""><p id="036e2eb4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the affirmation or promise.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="036e2eb5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Any description of the goods which is made a part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the description.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p id="036e2eb6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issue whether a particular affirmation of fact made by the seller constitutes an express warranty is generally a question of fact. See id., Official Comment 3; Daughtrey v. Ashe, 243 Va. 73, 78, 413 S.E.2d 336, 339 (1992). In <i>Daughtrey,</i> we examined whether a jeweler’s statement on an appraisal form constituted an express warranty. We held that the jeweler’s description of the particular diamonds being purchased as “v.v.s. quality” constituted an express warranty that the diamonds were, in fact, of that grade. Id. at 77, 413 S.E.2d at 338.</p>
<p id="036e2eb7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unlike the representation in <i>Daughtrey,</i> however, the statements in the “prop matrixes” provided by Bayliner did not relate to the particular boat purchased by Crow, or to one having substantially similar characteristics. By their plain terms, the figures stated in the “prop matrixes” referred to a boat with different sized propellers that carried equipment weighing substantially less than the equipment on Crow’s boat. Therefore, we conclude that the statements contained in the “prop matrixes” did not constitute an express warranty by Bayliner about the performance capabilities of the particular boat purchased by Crow.</p>
<p id="036e2eb8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Crow also contends that Bayliner made an express warranty regarding the boat’s maximum speed in the statement in Bayliner’s sales brochure that this model boat “delivers the kind of performance you need to get to the prime offshore fishing grounds.” While the general rule is that a description of the goods that forms a basis of the bargain constitutes an express warranty, Code <span title="551" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-551">p. 551</span>§8.2-313(2) directs that “a statement purporting to be merely the seller’s opinion or commendation of the goods does not create a warranty.”</p>
<p id="036e2eb9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statement made by Bayliner in its sales brochure is merely a commendation of the boat’s performance and does not describe a specific characteristic or feature of the boat. The statement simply expressed the manufacturer’s opinion concerning the quality of the boat’s performance and did not create an express warranty that the boat was capable of attaining a speed of 30 miles per hour. Therefore, we conclude that the evidence does not support the trial court’s finding that Bayliner breached an express warranty made to Crow.</p>
<p id="036e2eba-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We next consider whether the evidence supports the trial court’s conclusion that Bayliner breached an implied warranty of merchantability. Crow asserts that because his boat was not capable of achieving a maximum speed of 30 miles per hour, it was not fit for its ordinary purpose as an offshore sport fishing boat. Bayliner contends in response that, although the boat did not meet the needs of this particular sport fisherman, there was no evidence from which the trial court could conclude that the boat generally was not merchantable as an offshore fishing boat. We agree with Bayliner’s argument.</p>
<p id="036e2ebb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Code §8.2-314 provides that, in all contracts for the sale of goods by a merchant, a warranty is implied that the goods will be merchantable. To be merchantable, the goods must be such as would “pass without objection in the trade” and as “are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used.” Code §8.2-314(2)(a), (c). The first phrase concerns whether a “significant segment of the buying public” would object to buying the goods, while the second phrase concerns whether the goods are “reasonably capable of performing their ordinary functions.” Federal Signal Corp. v. Safety Factors, Inc., 125 Wash. 2d 413, 886 P.2d 172, 180 (Wash. 1994). In order to prove that a product is not merchantable, the complaining party must first establish the standard of merchantability in the trade. Laird v. Scribner Coop, Inc., 237 Neb. 532, 466 N.W.2d 798, 804 (Neb. 1991). Bayliner correctly notes that the record contains no evidence of the standard of merchantability in the offshore fishing boat trade. Nor does the record contain any evidence supporting a conclusion that a significant portion of the boat-buying public would object to purchasing an offshore fishing boat with the speed capability of the 3486 Trophy Convertible.</p>
<p id="036e2ebc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Crow, nevertheless, relies on his own testimony that the boat’s speed was inadequate for his intended use, and Atherton’s opinion testimony that the boat took “a long time” to reach certain fishing grounds in the Gulf Stream off the coast of Virginia. However, this evidence did not address the standard of merchantability in the trade or whether Crow’s boat failed to meet that standard. Thus, we hold that Crow failed to prove that the boat would not “pass without objection in the trade” as required by Code §8.2-314(2)(a).</p>
<p id="036e2ebd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We next consider whether the record supports a conclusion that Crow’s boat was not fit for its ordinary purpose as an offshore sport fishing boat. Generally, the issue whether goods are fit for the ordinary purposes for which they are used is a factual question. See Federal Ins. Co. v. Village of Westmont, 271 Ill. App. 3d 892, 649 N.E.2d 986, 990, 208 Ill. Dec. 626 (App. Ct. Ill. 1995); Tallmadge v. Aurora Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., 25 Wash. App. 90, 605 P.2d 1275, <span title="552" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-552">p. 552</span>1278 (Wash. Ct. App. 1979). Here, the evidence is uncontroverted that Crow used the boat for offshore fishing, at least during the first few years after purchasing it, and that the boat’s engines were used for 850 hours. While Crow stated that many of those hours were incurred during various repair or modification attempts and that the boat was of little value to him, this testimony does not support a conclusion that a boat with this speed capability is generally unacceptable as an offshore fishing boat. Thus, considered in the light most favorable to Crow, the evidence fails to establish that the boat was not fit for the ordinary purpose for which it was intended.</p>
<p id="036e55ce-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We next address Crow’s claim that Bayliner breached an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. Code §8.2-315 provides that when a seller “has reason to know any particular purpose for which the goods are required and that the buyer is relying on the seller’s skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods, there is . . . an implied warranty that the goods shall be fit for such purpose.” See also Medcom, Inc. v. C. Arthur Weaver Co., Inc., 232 Va. 80, 84-85, 348 S.E.2d 243, 246 (1986). This statute embodies a long-standing common law rule in Virginia. Layne-Atlantic Co. v. Koppers Co., 214 Va. 467, 471, 201 S.E.2d 609, 613 (1974). The question whether there was an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose in a sale of goods is ordinarily a question of fact based on the circumstances surrounding the transaction. Stones v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 251 Neb. 560, 558 N.W.2d 540, 547 (Neb. 1997).</p>
<p id="036e55cf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Crow contends that the “particular purpose” for which the boat was intended was use as an offshore fishing boat capable of traveling at a maximum speed of 30 miles per hour. However, to establish an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, the buyer must prove as a threshold matter that he made known to the seller the particular purpose for which the goods were required. See <i>Medcom,</i> 232 Va. at 84, 348 S.E.2d at 246. The record before us does not support a conclusion that Crow informed Atherton of this precise requirement. Although Crow informed Atherton that he intended to use the boat for offshore fishing and discussed the boat’s speed in this context, these facts did not establish that Atherton knew on the date of sale that a boat incapable of travelling at 30 miles per hour was unacceptable to Crow. Thus, we conclude that the evidence fails to support the trial court’s ruling that Bayliner breached an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.</p>
<p id="036e55d0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For these reasons, we will reverse the trial court’s judgment and enter final judgment in favor of Bayliner.</p>
<p id="036e55d1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reversed and final judgment.</p>

<li class=""><p id="036e55d4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Elements of an express warranty.</i> Under UCC §2-313, a seller may provide the basis for an express warranty in several ways: making a representation about the goods, giving a description, or displaying a sample or model. The <i>Bayliner Marine</i> court cited the earlier case of Daughtrey v. Ashe, 413 S.E.2d <span title="553" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-553">p. 553</span>336 (Va. 1992), as providing an example of an affirmation of fact about goods (the statement about the quality of diamonds) that served as basis for an express warranty. See also Avola v. Louisiana-Pacific Corp., 991 F. Supp. 2d 381 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) (plaintiff sufficiently pled claim for breach of express warranty based on statement that composite siding would “take a nail just like wood”; during installation a nail ricocheted off siding and lodged in plaintiff’s eye); Goodwin v. Durant Bank &amp; Trust Co., 952 P.2d 41 (Okla. 1998) (description of backhoe equipment as 1990 model amounted to express warranty; equipment actually was 1987 model). The <i>Bayliner Marine</i> court also noted, however, the need to distinguish between a type of factual representation about the quality of goods that may give rise to an express warranty and “mere puffery” or sales talk that will not serve as a basis for a binding commitment. See Boud v. SDNCO, Inc., 54 P.3d 1131 (Utah 2002) (affirmation of fact must be objective and capable of being proven true or false; statement that boat was “best in class” or “superb” would be puffery but statement that boat was “fastest in class” could be verified). How would you assess the seller’s statements or conduct in <i>Bayliner Marine</i> with regard to this aspect of an express warranty?</p>
<p id="036e55d5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a second element, pre-Code law required that a buyer prove reliance on a representation about the quality of the goods to establish that an express warranty had been created. See Uniform Sales Act §12. Whether reliance is required under the Code is unclear. The text of UCC §2-313 provides that an affirmation, promise, description, sample, or model will amount to an express warranty if it is part of the “basis of the bargain,” but does not define that concept. However, Comment 3 to UCC §2-313 provides that once a seller has made an affirmation of fact about the goods, “no particular reliance on such statements need be shown in order to weave them into the fabric of the agreement. Rather, any fact which is to take such affirmations, once made, out of the agreement requires clear affirmative proof.” The courts are divided on the issue of whether reliance is an element of an express warranty claim. Three approaches can be found in the case law. Some courts have dispensed with the reliance requirement completely if the claimed warranty reflects the reasonable expectations of the buyer. At the opposite extreme, some jurisdictions require the plaintiff to prove reliance as an element of the cause of action. Finally, other courts take an intermediate approach holding that any affirmations by the seller relating to the goods create a rebuttable presumption that the statements are part of the basis of the bargain. However, the seller can rebut this presumption by clear proof that the buyer did not rely on the statements. See generally Katie McLaughlin, Another Argument “Pops Up” Against Reliance in Express Warranty Law, 28 J.L. &amp; Com. 95 (2009) (surveying various positions on meaning of “basis of bargain” before concluding that increasingly popular view and preferable rule is that proof of reliance is not required once seller makes representation to buyer; seller may state affirmative defense by clearly showing that buyer did not rely).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="036e55d6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Implied warranty of merchantability.</i> The buyer in <i>Bayliner Marine</i> also sought recovery based on the implied warranty of merchantability in UCC §2-314. For this warranty to arise, the buyer must establish that the seller is <span title="554" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-554">p. 554</span>a “merchant” with respect to the goods sold. A merchant is defined in the Code as a party who regularly deals in goods of the kind or holds itself out as having particular knowledge about the kind of goods. UCC §2-104(1). If the seller is a merchant, UCC §2-314(2) includes several alternative bases for assessing the merchantability of goods, including the two most frequently applied tests: whether the goods would “pass without objection in the trade” and “are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used.” The range of cases involving the implied warranty of merchantability is vast, from the sale of very expensive equipment to the purchase of a hamburger. See, e.g., T &amp; M Solar and Air Conditioning, Inc. v. Lennox Int’l Inc., 83 F. Supp. 3d 855 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (plaintiffs stated claim for breach of implied warranty of merchantability in alleging that solar panels could not operate in solar electrical system as delivered); Mitchell v. BBB Services Co., Inc., 582 S.E.2d 470 (Ga. Ct. App. 2003) (bone in hamburger would constitute breach of implied warranty of merchantability if it would not be reasonably expected by consumer). Do you think the buyer in <i>Bayliner Marine</i> could have made a better case for the proposition that the boat was not merchantable? What evidence should the buyer have offered?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="036e55d7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. </i> The implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose under §2-315 differs from the implied warranty of merchantability in several respects. First, liability under this warranty is not limited to merchant sellers. Second, the warranty is created only when the buyer relies on the seller’s skill or judgment to select suitable goods for the buyer’s particular purpose and the seller has reason to know of this reliance. Third, breach of the warranty does not require a showing that the goods are defective in any way — merely that the goods are not fit for the buyer’s particular purpose. See, e.g., Neilson Bus. Equip. Ctr., Inc. v. Monteleone, 524 A.2d 1172 (Del. 1987) (computer equipment did not meet needs of buyer who relied on seller to select goods and customize software). Most courts also hold that the buyer’s particular purpose must be one other than the ordinary use of the goods. Compare Tamayo v. CGS Tires US, Inc., 2012 WL 2129353 (D. Neb.) (tractor tire which exploded could not give rise to claim for breach of fitness warranty because buyer’s use was ordinary use), with In re Atlas Roofing Corp. Chalet Shingle Products Liab. Litig., 22 F. Supp. 3d 1322 (N.D. Ga. 2014) (in class action case involving quality of shingles, South Carolina law allows fitness warranty to apply even if particular use is also ordinary use).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="036e55d8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Disclaimers of express warranties.</i> Warranty obligations arise as a matter of contract, and the Code also allows sellers to eliminate or modify the Code’s warranties by agreement. The validity of disclaimers of warranties is governed by UCC §2-316. Under §2-316(1), a disclaimer of an express warranty is inoperative if the disclaimer cannot be construed as “consistent” with terms in the contract that would create the express warranty. UCC §2-316(1), Comment 1. See, e.g., Consolidated Data Terminals v. Applied Digital Data Systems, Inc., 708 F.2d 385 (9th Cir. 1983) (manufacturer’s specifications about speed of computer constituted express warranty and were not disclaimed by language in contract providing that the manufacturer “makes no warranty, express or implied”). Since express warranties may be created orally or by one of several <span title="555" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-555">p. 555</span>writings, the existence of an express warranty may turn on the application of the parol evidence rule. Indeed, UCC §2-316(1) states that it is “subject to” the provisions of UCC §2-202, the parol evidence rule. See, e.g., Hoover Universal, Inc. v. Brockway Imco, Inc., 809 F.2d 1039 (4th Cir. 1987) (evidence regarding seller’s earlier representations about machine’s capacity was inadmissible since subsequent written contract was intended by parties to be final expression of their agreement). Some courts, however, have found grounds to permit evidence of express warranties despite the parol evidence rule. See, e.g., La Trace v. Webster, 17 So. 3d 1210 (Ala. Civ. App. 2008) (statement at auctions that items sold to buyer were Tiffany lamps went to “core description” and could not be disclaimed despite multiple “as is” disclaimers contained in auction terms and conditions and sales receipt; moreover, description was given during auction after terms and conditions were received by buyer).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="036e7ce9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Disclaimers and implied warranties.</i> The implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose can be disclaimed in several ways under UCC §2-316(2) and (3). To disclaim the implied warranty of <i>merchantability</i> under §2-316(2), “the language must mention merchantability and in the case of a writing must be conspicuous.” In contrast, the Code provides that a disclaimer of the implied warranty of <i>fitness</i> for a particular purpose must be in a conspicuous writing and will be effective if it states that “[t]here are no warranties which extend beyond the description on the face hereof.” UCC §2-316(2). Thus, the disclaiming language for the fitness warranty can be less specific than that required for the implied warranty of merchantability, but it must be in a writing. Moreover, additional methods of excluding the implied warranties are found in §2-316(3), probably the most common of which is the “as is” disclaimer. Section 2-316(3), unlike §2-316(2), does not include a conspicuousness requirement, but most courts agree that one should be implied to carry out the section’s purpose of avoiding surprise to buyers. See, e.g., Lumber Mut. Ins. Co. v. Clarklift of Detroit, Inc., 569 N.W.2d 681 (Mich. Ct. App. 1997) (“as is” disclaimer must be conspicuous to be effective); but see DeKalb Agresearch, Inc. v. Abbott, 391 F. Supp. 152 (N.D. Ala. 1974) (applying the statutory language literally and holding that “as is” disclaimer need not be conspicuous), <i>aff’d,</i> 511 F.2d 1162 (5th Cir. 1975). Notably, some states have enacted nonuniform versions of §2-316, making all disclaimers of the implied warranty of merchantability ineffective in consumer transactions. See, e.g., Wolfe v. Welton, 558 S.E.2d 363 (W. Va. 2001). In addition, the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act, 15 U.S.C. §2301 et seq., a federal statute that regulates warranties in consumer transactions, prohibits a warrantor who makes a “written warranty” as defined in the act from disclaiming any implied warranties. See Semitekol v. Monaco Coach Corp., 582 F. Supp. 2d 1009 (N.D. Ill. 2008).</p></li>

If goods are defective, plaintiffs may attempt to bring claims for damages either in tort — typically negligence or strict liability — or in contract for breach of warranty. Tort claims usually offer advantages to plaintiffs because various defenses that apply to contract claims, such as disclaimers, privity of contract, and notice, generally do not apply to tort claims. However, sometimes a contract claim may be <span title="556" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-556">p. 556</span>beneficial to the plaintiff because the statute of limitations for contract claims in most jurisdictions is longer than the tort statute. But see UCC §2-725(1) (providing for a four-year statute of limitations, but the parties may by contract reduce the statutory period to one year). If the plaintiff has suffered personal injury damages, the plaintiff may be able to sue in either contract for breach of warranty or in tort. However, if the plaintiff has suffered only “economic loss,” typically a decline in value of the product or lost profits, courts have generally limited the plaintiff to a contract action. When the plaintiff’s claim involves damage to the product itself, some jurisdictions will allow tort law to govern if the damage is the result of a “calamitous event”; however, most courts will treat claims for damage to the product as governed by contract law regardless of the cause. See, e.g., Giddings &amp; Lewis, Inc. v. Industrial Risk Insurer, 348 S.W.3d 729 (Ky. 2011).</p></li>

<p id="036e7cec-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the seventeenth century the English courts first adopted what has since come to be known as the principle of “caveat emptor”: “let the buyer beware.” This doctrine meant that the seller bore no responsibility at all for the quality of the product he was selling unless he expressly guaranteed it or gave a “warranty” to the buyer. The leading case for this doctrine was Chandelor v. Lopus, 79 Eng. Rep. 3, decided by the Court of Exchequer-Chamber in 1603. In <i>Chandelor</i> the defendant, a goldsmith, sold a stone to the plaintiff. Although the defendant had “affirmed” that the stone was a “bezar-stone,” this representation turned out to be false, and the plaintiff brought suit. The court held for the defendant because “the bare affirmation that it was a bezar-stone, without warranting it to be so, is no cause of action. . . .” Moreover, the court held that the declaration did not state a cause of action even if the defendant knew that his statements were false, because “every one in selling his wares will affirm that his wares are good, or the horse which he sells is sound; yet if he does not warrant them to be so, it is no cause of action. . . .” (A “bezar-stone” was not a precious jewel but instead “an object somewhat similar to a gall stone, but formed in the intestines of goats, and was thought at the time to possess medicinal value.” Alfred W. B. Simpson, A History of the Common Law of Contract 536 (1975). Does this fact affect your view of the holding in <i>Chandelor</i>?)</p>
<p id="036e7ced-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">American courts embraced the doctrine of caveat emptor in the nineteenth century. For example, in Seixas v. Woods, 2 Caine R. 48 (N.Y. 1804), the defendant, a middleman, sold certain wood, advertised as “brazilletto,” to the plaintiff. Unknown to either the buyer or the seller, the wood was “peachum,” a much less valuable type of wood. In an action by the buyer seeking a refund of the price, the New York Court of Errors held for the seller because no warranty was made. See generally Walton H. Hamilton, The Ancient Maxim Caveat Emptor, 40 Yale L.J. 1133 (1931).</p>
<p id="036e7cee-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the last quarter of the nineteenth century, American courts, responding to changing market conditions, gradually reversed the rule of caveat emptor by imposing obligations on the seller as to the quality of goods sold. These <span title="557" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-557">p. 557</span>obligations, or “implied warranties,” were not based on actual agreement of the parties but were instead imposed by law on the seller. By 1906, the arguments for imposing warranty obligations on sellers had become generally accepted, and enough particular instances had been sanctioned by case law that the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws felt justified in including in its newly promulgated Uniform Sales Act several provisions for implied warranties in the sale of goods. See, e.g., §§14 (implied warranty in sale by description); 15 (implied warranties of quality); 16 (implied warranties in sale by sample). See generally Karl N. Llewellyn, On Warranty of Quality, and Society (Pts. I, II), 36 Colum. L. Rev. 699 (1936), 37 Colum. L. Rev. 341 (1937); Timothy J. Sullivan, Innovation in the Law of Warranty: The Burden of Reform, 32 Hastings L.J. 341 (1980).</p>

The court of appeals affirmed. Both the district court and the court of appeals expressly declined to recognize an implied-warranty claim in favor of third-party purchasers, deferring for such a decision to this court. We now extend our common law of implied warranty to cover such parties and therefore vacate the decision of the court of appeals, reverse the judgment of the district court, and remand for further proceedings.</p>

<p id="036ecb21-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Speights are the present owners of a home in Clive, Iowa, which was custom-built in 1995 by the defendant, Walters Development Company, Ltd. It was built for use by the original buyers, named Roche. The Roches sold the home to people named Rogers, who in turn sold it to the Speights on August 1, 2000. Sometime after purchasing the home, the Speights noticed water damage and mold. A building inspector determined that the damage was the result of a defectively constructed roof and defective rain gutters. Nothing in the record indicates that any of the owners between the original builder and the Speights had actual or imputed knowledge of these defects.</p>
<p id="036ecb22-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Speights filed suit against Walters on May 23, 2005, alleging a breach of implied warranty of workmanlike construction and general negligence in construction of the home. Both the Speights and Walters moved for summary judgment, raising the issue of whether the Speights, as remote purchasers, could pursue a claim for breach of an implied warranty of workmanlike construction. Walters also raised the issue of whether the plaintiffs’ claim for breach of implied warranty was barred by Iowa Code section 614.1(4) (2005), the applicable statute of limitations. The district court concluded that, under the present <span title="559" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-559">p. 559</span>state of the law, the Speights could not maintain an implied-warranty claim, and in any event, such claim would be barred by the statute of limitations. The district court also concluded that the Speights could not bring a general negligence claim because they did not assert an accompanying claim for personal injury—a ruling the plaintiffs do not challenge on appeal.</p>

<p id="036ecb24-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The implied warranty of workmanlike construction is a judicially created doctrine implemented to protect an innocent home buyer by holding the experienced builder accountable for the quality of construction. <i>See</i> 17 Richard A. Lord, Williston on Contracts §50:30 (4th ed. 2007) [hereinafter Lord]. Home buyers are generally in an inferior position when purchasing a home from a builder-vendor because of the buyer’s lack of expertise in quality home construction and the fact that many defects in construction are latent. These defects, even if the home were inspected by a professional, would not be discoverable. <i>See</i> Sean M. O’Brien, Note, Caveat Venditor: A Case for Granting Subsequent Purchasers a Cause of Action Against Builder–Vendors for Latent Defects in the Home, 20 J. Corp. L. 525, 529 (Spring 1995).</p>
<p id="036ecb25-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The implied warranty of workmanlike construction addresses the inequities between the buyer and the builder-vendor by requiring that a building be constructed “in a reasonably good and workmanlike manner and . . . be reasonably fit for the intended purpose.” Kirk v. Ridgway, 373 N.W.2d 491, 492 (Iowa 1985). In <i>Kirk</i> this court applied the doctrine of implied warranty of workmanlike construction to the sale of a home by the builder to the first owner. 373 N.W.2d at 496. In doing so, we noted that interest in consumer protection had increased, and the complexity of homes had increased, making it difficult for a buyer to discover defects in the construction. <i>Id.</i> at 493–94. In <i>Kirk</i> we rejected the application of the doctrine of <i>caveat emptor</i> under which “it has been observed, courts considered purchasing as a game of chance.” <i>Id.</i> at 493 (citing Roberts, The Case of the Unwary Home Buyer: The Housing Merchant Did It, 52 Cornell L.Q. 835, 836 (1967)). We noted that home buyers are ill-equipped to discover defects in homes, which are increasingly complex, and therefore must rely on the skill and judgment of the vendor. <i>Id.</i> at 494.</p>

Michael A. DiSabatino, J.D., Annotation, Liability of Builder of Residence for Latent Defects Therein as Running to Subsequent Purchasers from Original Vendee, 10 A.L.R.4th 385, 388 (1981) [hereinafter DiSabatino]. The implied warranty of workmanlike construction is contractual in nature, and because privity is traditionally required in order to maintain a contract action, some courts have concluded that the lack of privity between the subsequent purchaser and the builder-vendor prevents the subsequent purchaser’s implied-warranty claim. O’Brien, 20 J. Corp. L. at 537; see also Mary Dee Pridgen, Consumer Protection and the Law §18:19 (2006) [hereinafter Pridgen] (discussing the holding in Crowder v. Vandendeale, 564 S.W.2d 879, 881 (Mo. 1978)); 2 James Acret, Construction Law Digests §14:12 (2007) [hereinafter Acret] . . . . Further, because there is a lack of privity between the subsequent purchaser and the builder-vendor, there is no reliance by the subsequent purchaser on any representations made by the builder-vendor regarding the quality of construction. See Pridgen, §18:19. Finally, some courts have concluded that the justifications for eliminating the privity requirement in products liability cases do not exist in the sale of real estate. See DiSabatino, 10 A.L.R.4th at 397–98 (“The court reasoned that a house which is not the product of a mass marketing scheme or which is not designed as a temporary dwelling differs from the usual item to which the principles of strict liability have generally been applied, in that it is not an item which generally changes owners or occupants frequently.” (discussing Coburn v. Lenox Homes, Inc., 173 Conn. 567, 378 A.2d 599 (1977))).</p>

This principle is “ ‘equally applicable to subsequent purchasers’ ” who are in no better position to discover those defects than the original purchaser. Acret, §14:12 (discussing and quoting the holding in Lempke v. Dagenais<i>,</i> 130 N.H. 782, 547 A.2d 290 (1988)); see also Pridgen, §18:19 (“ ‘The purpose of a warranty is to protect innocent purchasers and hold builders accountable for their work. With that object in mind, any reasoning which would arbitrarily interpose a first buyer as an obstruction to someone equally as deserving of recovery is incomprehensible.’ ” (quoting Moxley v. Laramie Builders, Inc., 600 P.2d 733, 736 (Wyo. 1979))). Thus, the public policy justifications for eliminating the doctrine of <i>caveat emptor</i> for original purchasers of new homes similarly support allowing subsequent purchasers to recover on a theory of a breach of the implied warranty of workmanlike construction. . . . Further, the purpose of the implied warranty of workmanlike construction is to ensure the home “ ‘will be fit for habitation,’ a matter that ‘depends upon the quality of the dwelling delivered’ not the status of the buyer.” Pridgen, §18:19 (quoting Tusch Enters. v. Coffin, 113 Idaho 37, 740 P.2d 1022 (1987)).</p>
<p id="036ef245-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The lack of privity between the subsequent purchaser and the builder-vendor is not an impediment, in these jurisdictions, to allowing a subsequent purchaser to recover on an implied-warranty claim. Though the implied warranty of workmanlike construction “ ‘has roots in the execution of the contract for sale,’ ” it exists independently of the contract by its very nature. O’Brien, 20 J. Corp. L. at 538 (citations omitted). Additionally, requiring privity to sue for a breach of an implied warranty has been disfavored in products liability cases in some jurisdictions. Many jurisdictions find similar justifications for extinguishing the privity requirement in the purchase of a home. See O’Brien, §50:30 (“[T]he builder was in the same position as a manufacturer who sells an article which, if defective, will be imminently dangerous to persons who come in contact with it, ‘and liability is not limited to those with whom the manufacturer contracts.’ ” (quoting Leigh v. Wadsworth, 361 P.2d 849 (Okla. 1961))). From a practical perspective, these jurisdictions note that many latent defects “are often not discoverable for some time after completion of the house. By the time the defects come to light, the original purchasers may have sold the home. For that reason, subsequent purchasers need protection for faulty construction.” Pridgen, §18:19. Additionally, the reality is that our society is increasingly mobile, and as a result, a home’s ownership is likely to change hands a number of times. <i>See</i> O’Brien, 20 J. Corp. L. at 526 (noting that, at the time the note was written, “[n]early four million single-family used homes [were] sold in the United States every year”). A blanket rule prohibiting subsequent purchasers from recovering for a breach of the implied warranty of workmanlike construction would do injustice to those who purchase a home from a previous buyer shortly after the home was constructed when the subsequent purchaser later discovers that the home was defectively constructed. See id. at 538. Finally, one author posits that the doctrine of assignment allows for the transfer to the subsequent purchaser of the original purchaser’s right to sue for breach of the implied warranty of workmanlike construction. <i>Id.</i> at 538–40.</p>
<p id="036ef246-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="562" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-562">p. 562</span>We believe that Iowa law should follow the modern trend allowing a subsequent purchaser to recover against a builder-vendor for a breach of the implied warranty of workmanlike construction. As in many jurisdictions, this court has eliminated the privity requirement in products liability cases raising a breach-of-implied-warranty claim. See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Anderson–Weber, Inc., 252 Iowa 1289, 110 N.W.2d 449, 456 (Iowa 1961). As the court discussed in <i>State Farm,</i> the privity requirement was eliminated in other jurisdictions to “ ‘ameliorate the harsh doctrine of <i>caveat emptor,</i>’ “ and because “ ‘the [implied warranty] obligations on the part of the seller were imposed by operation of law, and did not depend for their existence upon express agreement of the parties,’ ” privity was not necessary. <i>Id.</i> at 454 (quoting Henningsen v. Bloomfield Motors, Inc., 32 N.J. 358, 161 A.2d 69 (1960)). The same is true in a case such as the present one in which a home buyer raises an implied-warranty claim. Further, the implied warranty of workmanlike construction is a judicial creation and does not, in itself, arise from the language of any contract between the builder-vendor and the original purchaser. Thus, it is not extinguished upon the original purchaser’s sale of the home to a subsequent purchaser. The builder-vendor warrants that the home was constructed in a workmanlike manner, not that it is fit for any particular purpose the original owner intended. As such, there is no contractual justification for limiting recovery to the original purchaser.</p>
<p id="036ef247-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Additionally, the public policy justifications supporting our decision to recede from the doctrine of <i>caveat emptor</i> in the sale of new homes by builder-vendors equally apply to the sale of used homes to subsequent purchasers. As discussed above, latent defects are, by definition, undiscoverable by reasonable inspection. Thus, the subsequent purchaser is in no better position to discover those defects than the original purchaser. It is inequitable to allow an original purchaser to recover while, simultaneously, prohibiting a subsequent purchaser from recovering for latent defects in homes that are the same age.</p>
<p id="036ef248-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Walters contends that allowing the recovery the Speights seek would lead to increased costs for builders, increased claims, and increased home prices. However, builder-vendors are currently required to build a home in a good and workmanlike manner. The implied warranty of workmanlike construction reasonably puts the risk of shoddy construction on the builder-vendor. The builder-vendor’s risk is not increased by allowing subsequent purchasers to recover for the same latent defects for which an original purchaser could recover. As discussed more fully below, the statute of limitations and statute of repose are the same for original purchasers and subsequent purchasers, thus eliminating any increased time period within which a builder-vendor is subject to suit.</p>
<p id="036ef249-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Walters argues that allowing subsequent purchasers to recover for a breach of the implied warranty of workmanlike construction would subject builder-vendors to unlimited liability; however, we are not persuaded. Iowa Code section 614.1(11) provides a safety net—a statute of repose for potential plaintiffs seeking to recover for breach of an implied warranty on an improvement to real property. A statute of repose works to “ ‘terminate[] any right of action after a specified time has elapsed, regardless of whether or not there has as yet been an injury.’ ” Bob McKiness Excavating &amp; Grading, Inc. v. Morton, 507 N.W.2d 405, 408 (Iowa 1993) (quoting <span title="563" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-563">p. 563</span>Hanson v. Williams County, 389 N.W.2d 319, 321 (N.D. 1986)). Section 614.1(11) applies to an action for breach of the implied warranty of workmanlike construction in the purchase of a building. <i>See id.</i> at 409. That section provides:</p>

The court rejected that argument and held that a “discovery” rule would apply to actions for breach of the implied warranty of workmanlike construction. Thus, the cause of action would not accrue until the plaintiffs had actual or imputed knowledge of the facts that would support a cause of action. Such discovery could not have occurred before the plaintiffs bought the house in August 2000. — E<span class="epub-small-caps">ds</span>.]</p>

<li class=""><p id="036f3f78-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Implied warranties of quality in new home sales.</i> A clear majority of jurisdictions has recognized an implied warranty of quality in the sale of a new home by a builder-vendor. See Alisa M. Levin, Condo Developers and Fiduciary Duties: An Unlikely Pairing? 24 Loy. Consumer L. Rev. 197, 236 n.134 (2011). The warranty may be called an implied warranty of workmanlike construction, as in <i>Speight,</i> or by a variety of other names including warranty of habitability, skillful construction, or merchantability. For example, the New Jersey Supreme Court held that an implied warranty of “reasonable workmanship and habitability” attaches to the sale of a new home by the builder-vendor in McDonald v. Mianecki, 398 A.2d 1283, 1292-1293 (N.J. 1979). The <i>McDonald</i> court observed that “[c]learly every builder-vendor holds himself out, expressly or impliedly, as having the expertise necessary to construct a livable dwelling. It is equally as obvious that almost every buyer acts upon these representations and expects that the new house he is buying, whether already constructed or not yet built, will be suitable for use as a home. Otherwise, there would be no sale.” Id. Courts adopting the implied warranty of quality for new housing have frequently analogized to the implied warranties under the UCC in the sale of goods and observed that the justifications for such implied terms apply even more compellingly to the purchase of a home, the single largest economic investment for most consumers. Maronda Homes, Inc. of Florida v. Lakeview Reserve Homeowners Ass’n, Inc., 127 So. 3d 1258, 1264 (Fla. 2013).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="036f3f79-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Habitability versus workmanlike or skillful construction.</i> The <i>Speight</i> court states that the builder-vendor must construct a house “in a reasonably good and workmanlike manner” and that it must “be reasonably fit for the intended purpose.” As suggested by the formulation in the <i>Speight</i> case, the implied housing warranty may have two separable components — a warranty of habitability and a warranty of workmanlike or skillful construction — though the courts have not been consistent or clear in recognizing the distinction. See Albrecht v. Clifford, 767 N.E.2d 42 (Mass. 2002). First, the implied warranty of workmanlike or skillful construction requires that the quality of work and materials meet average or reasonable standards for the trade. Second, and in contrast, the implied warranty of habitability requires that the home be suitable for occupation and provide inhabitants with a reasonably safe place to live without fear of injury to person, health, safety or property. Id. at 45. In Aronsohn v. Mandara, 484 A.2d 675 (N.J. 1984), the New Jersey Supreme Court <span title="565" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-565">p. 565</span>held that a poorly constructed patio added to a preexisting home would not come within the implied warranty of habitability because it did not fall within the scope of necessities to make a home suitable for living; however, the court did hold that a builder could be held liable for breach of an implied warranty that the patio would be constructed in a good quality manner. Do you agree that courts should imply a warranty of skillful construction in addition to a warranty of habitability?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="036f3f7a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Extended application of the implied warranty.</i> After recognizing the existence of an implied warranty of quality in a new home sale between the builder-vendor and the initial buyer, courts have considered in subsequent cases whether the warranty should be extended in a substantial number of ways. The <i>Speight</i> court decided, of course, that the warranty should extend to subsequent purchasers beyond the initial buyers from the builder-vendor. The builder-vendor’s potential liability would be limited by the relevant statute of limitations, but it could not defend against subsequent owners merely because of lack of “privity.” As reflected by footnote 1 in <i>Speight</i>, however, other jurisdictions have rejected similar claims. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court recently denied standing for subsequent purchasers to bring suit against the builder-vendor, declining to follow the <i>Speight</i> court reasoning and instead concluding that the question of extending the implied warranty to subsequent purchasers was a matter <i>“</i>predominantly grounded in policy considerations that necessitate judgments reserved to the legislature after fact-finding and weighing of the ramifications of any decision.” Conway v. Cutler Group, Inc., 99 A.3d 67, 72 (Pa. 2014). Nevertheless, the <i>Conway</i> case did favorably cite a lower court decision that allowed standing to second purchasers of a new home who were the intended <i>first users</i>, having bought a condominium from a developer who was not the builder-vendor. Id. at 70-71 (citing Spivack v. Berks Ridge Corp., 586 A.2d 402 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1990)).</p>
<p id="036f3f7b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Beyond the subsequent purchaser question, courts have addressed a variety of other possible applications of the implied warranty in home construction. The Iowa Supreme Court that decided <i>Speight</i> later refused to extend the implied warranty of quality to a developer who bought a vacant lot intended for residential construction that was improperly graded, filled, and compacted by the vendor. Rosauer Corp. v. Sapp Dev., L.L.C., 856 N.W.2d 906 (Iowa 2014). In <i>Rosauer,</i> the court noted the significant difference between the ability of a consumer to protect against latent defects in a completed home and the ability of a developer to inspect and guard against problems with land that did not yet have a structure. Id. at 912-913. The Iowa Supreme Court also declined to extend the implied warranty protection to a bank that acquired a shoddily built, mold-infested apartment complex in lieu of foreclosure, on similar grounds that the bank could protect itself better than a consumer buying a single family residence. Luana Sav. Bank v. Pro-Build Holdings, Inc., 856 N.W.2d 892 (Iowa 2014).</p>
<p id="036f3f7c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In contrast, the Illinois courts have extended the implied warranty of habitability in a number of ways, including by allowing consumers to bring suit <span title="566" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-566">p. 566</span>against a subcontractor responsible for the latent defect when the builder-vendor is insolvent. See 1324 W. Pratt Condominium Ass’n v. Platt Constr. Group, Inc., 997 N.E.2d 246 (Ill. App. Ct. 2013) (noting the strong public policy in favor of protecting the innocent purchaser who is unable to guard against latent defects and placing the cost of repair on the contractor who is responsible for the defect). Similarly, the Florida Supreme Court decided to allow standing for a homeowners association asserting breach of an implied warranty of merchantability related to defective construction of storm drainage systems that severely undermined the habitability of homes in the development, even though the infrastructure was not a part of any single house itself. Maronda Homes, Inc. of Florida v. Lakeview Reserve Homeowners Ass’n, Inc., 127 So. 3d 1258 (Fla. 2013). Notably, the Florida state legislature enacted a law while the case was pending that severely limited the application of the <i>Maronda Homes</i> decision. Id. at 1270-1272.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="036f3f7d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Legislative action.</i> Several states have enacted legislation providing for implied warranties of quality in the sale of new homes. See Wendy B. Davis, Corrosion by Codification: The Deficiencies in the Statutory Versions of the Implied Warranty of Workmanlike Construction, 39 Creighton L. Rev. 103, 108 (2006) (listing states that have adopted statutes providing an implied warranty of quality for new homes). For example, the New York Court of Appeals recognized an implied warranty that a builder-vendor will construct a house in a skillful manner and free from material defect in Caceci v. DiCanio Construction Corp., 526 N.E.2d 266 (N.Y. 1988) and within weeks after the decision was rendered, the New York legislature enacted a housing merchant warranty law. See New York Gen. Bus. §§777-777b. See also Amy L. McDaniel, Note, The New York Housing Merchant Warranty Statute: Analysis and Proposals, 75 Cornell L. Rev. 754 (1990). The New York law creates three types of warranties: a one-year warranty of skillful construction; a two-year warranty on major systems such as plumbing, electrical, and heating and cooling; and a six-year warranty on latent, material defects. The statute also eliminates any “privity” requirement that would limit the warranty to initial purchasers. Notably, however, the law also has the effect of protecting the builder by narrowing the scope of the implied warranty through its definition of the terms “skillful” and “material defect,” and by excluding from its scope any obvious defects. Id. at 767-774.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="036f3f7e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Effectiveness of disclaimers.</i> Can the builder-vendor contractually modify or “disclaim” the implied warranty of habitability? The prevailing view is that the implied warranty of habitability may be modified or disclaimed. Many courts, however, view disclaimers with great suspicion and will refuse to enforce a disclaimer unless it is conspicuous, clearly states its effect, and reflects both parties’ expectations. E.g., McGuire v. Ryland Group, Inc., 497 F. Supp. 2d 1356 (M.D. Fla. 2007); Fattah v. Bim, 31 N.E.3d 922 (Ill. App. Ct. 2015). But see Albrecht v. Clifford, 767 N.E.2d 42, 47 (Mass. 2002) (holding that warranty cannot be waived or disclaimed “because to permit the disclaimer of a warranty protecting a purchaser from the consequences of latent defects would defeat the very purpose of the warranty”). The New York legislation cited above <span title="567" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-567">p. 567</span>permits exclusion or modification of the implied warranty if the seller provides a written warranty that complies with certain requirements as to form, but it also provides that a disclaimer is void as against public policy if it attempts to disclaim compliance with applicable building codes or if it permits the home to be unsafe. Should builder-vendors be able to disclaim the implied warranty of habitability? Is the sale of a new home analogous to the sale of goods, where sellers are allowed to disclaim implied warranties under UCC §2-316? Can you imagine circumstances in which both buyer and seller might wish to have an effective disclaimer?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="036f3f7f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Implied warranties and commercial buildings.</i> Should the courts imply a warranty of habitability in the sale of real estate that is commercial rather than residential? The courts are divided. Compare, e.g., Conklin v. Hurley, 428 So. 2d 654 (Fla. 1983) (developer of waterfront building lots not liable to investors for breach of implied warranty of habitability), with Tusch Enterprises v. Coffin, 740 P.2d 1022 (Idaho 1987) (investor could recover from vendor of three duplexes for breach of the implied warranty of habitability). See Frona M. Powell &amp; Jane P. Mallor, The Case for an Implied Warranty of Quality in Sales of Commercial Real Estate, 68 Wash. U. L.Q. 305 (1990). Do you think the implied warranty of habitability should apply to sale of commercial property? Why? Could a useful distinction be drawn between residential property held for investment purposes and purely commercial property, such as an office building, implying a warranty in the first situation but not the second?</p></li>

Regal sold roofing supplies to contractors and hardware stores. In August 2016, Regal was contacted by Empire Roofing Corp., a fairly new maker of environmentally friendly roofing material. Empire was interested in finding a distributor for its product in the Megatown area. After some negotiations, Regal and Empire signed an exclusive distributorship contract that stated: “Empire hereby grants Regal the exclusive rights to sell Empire roofing products in the Megatown area for five years, beginning September 1, 2016. Regal will use best efforts to promote Empire product sales.” Regal promptly began promoting and selling Empire products, and sales were very good. During summer 2018, Regal discovered that some contractors who had previously purchased Empire roofing material from Regal were now buying the Empire products from Suburban Roofing Co., located just outside the Megatown city limits. Moreover, it became clear to Regal that Suburban was buying Empire products at a lower price than the published wholesale price that Regal was paying. When Regal asked Empire about these sales, Empire responded that it had the legal right to sell to Suburban. Would Regal be likely to succeed in a lawsuit against Empire for breach of contract?</p>

Edna interviewed for both jobs and was offered both positons. She decided to accept the position with Acme, effective July 1, 2018. The personnel manager gave Edna a document entitled, “Acme Employee Retention Policy.” Part of the document stated that, “all employees are probationary for 90 days and then become permanent employees, eligible to participate in the employee retirement plan.” Edna began work and received “excellent” ratings from her supervisor, Sally, for each of her first three quarterly evaluations. On April 7, 2019, Edna had a heated argument with Sally during <span title="569" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-569">p. 569</span>lunch about the upcoming presidential election. Edna was suddenly terminated one week later by Sally with the only stated reason being “unsatisfactory performance.” If Edna can establish that she was terminated because of the argument, would she be likely to prevail in a lawsuit about her firing?</p>

He had a used road grader that he no longer needed and decided to offer for sale. Vern advertised the road grader for sale through a listing service for industrial equipment. In August 2018, Bob Buyer contracted Vern about buying the road grader. After some negotiations, Bob agreed to buy the road grader for $325,000. On August 15, 2018, Vern and Bob both signed a brief standard form sales agreement which accurately described the road grader and stated the purchase price. In a space designated, “Date for performance,” Bob wrote in, “payment and delivery after Buyer obtains financing.” On October 15, 2018, Vern called Bob and asked if the financing had been arranged. Bob responded that he had decided to delay buying the road grader until June 2019 and would let Vern know when he was ready to take delivery. Would Vern have a viable legal claim that Bob was in breach of the contract by delaying performance until June 2019?</p>

On July 2, 2018, First Bank agreed to make a short-term construction loan of $1 million that would be repayable in six months or at the end of construction, whichever came earlier. Hugh applied to Second Bank for long-term financing of $1 million, repayable over 15 years, to be provided upon completion of work. Second Bank agreed to make the long-term loan at an interest rate of 4 percent but insisted on including an addendum to the loan agreement that read, “Second Bank’s obligation to fund the loan is conditioned upon satisfactory monthly progress reports and final certificate of approval issued by an architect named by Second Bank verifying <span title="570" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-570">p. 570</span>that all work is of adequate quality.” From August through December 2018, the architect issued monthly reports verifying that construction on the hotel met the required quality standards. In early January 2019, Second Bank announced that it was reducing its commercial loan portfolio because residential lending was more profitable. Shortly thereafter, the architect issued a final report on Hugh’s hotel which stated that the renovations were not of adequate quality but stated no specific problems that could be corrected. Hugh has read reliable news reports that Second Bank is attempting to withdraw from all pending construction loan agreements. Would Hugh be likely to prevail in an action against Second Bank for breach of the loan agreement?</p>

<p id="033f2f48-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the preceding chapter, we explored the traditional elements of the basic contract paradigm: assent (offer and acceptance) and consideration. This chapter addresses what may seem on the face of it to be an unrelated collection of different doctrines and rules. They are all connected, however, by a common theme: When can one person enforce against another an obligation of performance that is similar to the obligation imposed by contract law, even though one of the traditional elements of contract-formation is missing? Section A presents the notion of promise-enforcement based on reliance, usually referred to as “promissory estoppel.” In Section B, we return to the fundamental contract-law tenet that offers are freely revocable (recall the <i>Normile</i> case) to survey a variety of approaches that might protect an offeree against the offeror’s attempt to withdraw her offer. And finally in Section C, we take a brief look at the notion of restitution (or relief for “unjust enrichment”) both as an independent basis for liability and as an influence on the development of contract law.</p>

<p id="033f2f4b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is common for legal commentators to regard traditional, or “classical,” contract law as a system of abstract, formal rules, self-contained and logically consistent, based on principles enunciated in the first instance by Professor Christopher Langdell and more fully developed by Professor Samuel Williston. And indeed this does pretty well describe the original Restatement of Contracts, officially adopted by the American Law Institute in 1932. During the preparation of the first Restatement, however, Professor Arthur Corbin argued that courts often used reliance as a basis of contractual obligation. Corbin’s work led to the inclusion of the reliance principle in §90 of the first Restatement.</p>
<p id="033f2f4c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="226" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-226">p. 226</span>Section 90 of the first Restatement was both short and deceptively simple. The section was entitled “Promise Reasonably Inducing Definite and Substantial Action.” (Although the principle is commonly called “promissory estoppel,” that term was not used in §90.) Its text provided as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="033f2f4d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance of a definite and substantial character on the part of the promisee and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.</p>
</div>
<p id="033f2f4e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the Restatement (Second) was drafted, the concept of promissory estoppel was preserved, and §90 was retained with only slight modification. The case law has generally accepted this concept, and applied it in a variety of ways to make enforceable what would otherwise be an unenforceable promise, when that promise has been relied on. In this chapter we focus on two of those situations. In this section we address the role of “unbargained-for reliance” generally as a substitute for consideration; in Section B we focus on the application of promissory estoppel to prevent an offeror from revoking her offer. In later chapters, we consider the effect of promisee-reliance on other contract doctrines, such as the statute of frauds.</p>
<div id="033f2f4f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="033f5660-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56">1.&nbsp;Promises Within the Family</p></h3></div>

<p id="033f5661-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On its face, the system of classical contract law would appear to apply as readily to dealings between two family members as it would to any other transaction. Upon reflection, however, it should be obvious that the nature of the bargain theory of consideration would exclude from the contract sphere most of the dealings between family members. Of course relatives can, and frequently do, enter into formal contracts with each other, but promises in the family context are likely to be actuated mainly by feelings of affection and altruism rather than by the expectation of a quid pro quo in return. In short, they are “gratuitous” — not part of a bargained-for exchange. To the extent that the law does impose legal obligations between persons in the family context, these obligations are for the most part based on the relationship of the parties — the parental duty of support, for example — rather than on contract. (We will see in the last section of this chapter, however, that some contemporary courts have also used the doctrine of restitution to create legal obligations in the family context when justice seems to demand it.) As the following materials demonstrate, promissory estoppel provides an important tool for courts to reach what they consider to be equitable resolutions for intra-family disputes. The first case below, Kirksey v. Kirksey, illustrates the doctrinal approaches available under the earlier common law of contract to resolve intra-family disputes stemming from promises made but not kept. The second case, Harvey v. Dow, and the Notes which follow it, demonstrate some of the ways in which courts have employed promissory estoppel in such situations to provide protection to promisees when justice seemed to require that.</p>

In 1840, the plaintiff resided on public land, under a contract of lease, she had held over, and was comfortably settled, and would have attempted to secure the land she lived on. The defendant resided in Talladega county, some sixty, or seventy miles off. On the 10th October, 1840, he wrote to her the following letter:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">

I should like to come and see you, but cannot with convenience at present. . . . I do not know whether you have a preference on the place you live on, or not. If you had, I would advise you to obtain your preference, and sell the land and quit the country, as I understand it is very unhealthy, and I know society is very bad. If you will come down and see me, I will let you have a place to raise your family, and I have more open land than I can tend; and on the account of your situation, and that of your family, I feel like I want you and the children to do well.</p>

<p id="033f566a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Within a month or two after the receipt of this letter, the plaintiff abandoned her possession, without disposing of it, and removed with her family, to the residence of the defendant, who put her in comfortable houses, and gave her land to cultivate for two years, at the end of which time he notified her to remove, and put her in a house, not comfortable, in the woods, which he afterwards required her to leave.</p>

My brothers, however think, that the promise on the part of the defendant, was a mere gratuity, and that an action will not lie for its breach. The judgment of the Court below must therefore be reversed, pursuant to the agreement of the parties.</p>

If either of these questions should be answered affirmatively, could the court have held that the defendant’s promise was supported by consideration? Perhaps, because he disagrees with the majority, the writer of the opinion does not shed much light on the question of why the court refused to find that the defendant’s promise was supported by consideration. (If nothing else, <i>Kirksey</i> demonstrates the wisdom of the more usual practice of having a proponent of the decision write the opinion explaining it.) Recall Professor Williston’s discussion of the “tramp hypothetical,” quoted in the <i>Pennsy Supply</i> case in Chapter 2.

Why did plaintiff’s brother-in-law invite her to move to his part of the state? Was his promise to her altruistic or did he expect something in return? Why did the defendant evict plaintiff from the property? Since there were good arguments for both sides of the case, why did the court decide for what appears to be the less sympathetic party? Was there perhaps gender bias on their part? See Debora L. Threedy, Dancing Around Gender: Lessons from Arthur Murray on Gender and Contracts, 45 Wake Forest L. Rev. 749, 751 n.16 (2010) (comparing <i>Kirksey</i> and Hamer v. Sidway, and suggesting that gender may be one explanation of the different results in the cases).

<p id="033fa497-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Teresa L. Harvey appeals from a judgment entered by the Superior Court (Penobscot County, <i>Hjelm, J.</i>) in favor of Jeffrey B. Dow Sr. and Kathryn L. Dow on Harvey’s complaint seeking to compel the Dows to convey to her the land on which she built a house, or for damages based on the value of the house. Harvey contends that she is entitled to a judgment on theories of promissory estoppel or the existence of a confidential relationship. We note that the findings of the Superior Court do not address the actions of the Dows beyond their generalized statements of intent and the possible application of section 90 of the Restatement of Contracts thereto. We vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>
<p id="033fa498-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><span title="229" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-229">p. 229</span><b>I.  <span class="epub-small-caps">Facts and Procedure</span></b></p>
<p id="033fa499-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Jeffrey Dow Sr. and Kathryn Dow are the parents of Teresa Harvey. The Dows own 125 acres of land in Corinth in two adjoining parcels, one fifty acres and the other seventy-five acres. They, their daughter Teresa, and their son Jeffrey Dow Jr. each have homes on the property. From the time they were young, Teresa and her brother talked about the houses they would eventually like to build on the homestead; Teresa said she wanted her home to be located near a spring, close to where it now sits. For their part, the Dows saw the land as their children’s heritage that would be left to them or given to them when they were older. Jeffrey Sr. testified that when the children were teenagers, he believed that his wife had promised them some land in the future, and the subject of the children living on the homestead was commonly discussed within the family.</p>
<p id="033fa49a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Superior Court found that the Dows had a general, non-specific plan to transfer land to the children at some undetermined time. In the court’s words, the “evidence at most reveals that Jeffrey Sr. expressed an intention to enter into an agreement to convey property sometime in the future,” and “Kathryn had made it clear that eventually, both Teresa and Jeffrey Jr. would end up with all or part of the two parcels.”</p>
<p id="033fa49b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1999, Teresa and her future husband, Jarrod Harvey, installed a mobile home on her parents’ land with their permission at the location where her brother’s mobile home is now located. She did not pay rent and did not ask her parents for a deed. Later, she and Jarrod built a garage near the mobile home, again with the Dows’ permission.</p>
<p id="033fa49c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Around January 2003, Teresa and Jarrod, by then married, decided to build a house on the lot where their mobile home then stood. At the Harveys’ request, the Dows agreed to use their home equity line of credit to initially finance the house. At trial, Teresa testified that part of the plan for repaying her parents included having them convey the building site to her by deed once the house was completed. Jeffrey Sr. denied any discussion of a deed at that time. In March 2003, Jarrod Harvey died in a motorcycle accident. Following his death, Teresa decided to finance the house with life insurance proceeds rather than use her parents’ home equity line.</p>
<p id="033fa49d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When it came time to do site preparation work for the new house, Teresa, her father, and her grandfather determined that it would cost no more to build further back on the property where Teresa had always wanted her house to be. Jeffrey Sr. agreed that she could build the house at its current site. Before construction began, Teresa and Jeffrey Sr. went to obtain a building permit from the town. There was no discussion of Teresa obtaining a deed at that point; she testified at trial that she did not ask her father for one directly because she did not need it then. The town initially denied Teresa a permit because she would not have the requisite amount of road frontage. A permit was eventually issued to Jeffrey Sr. for him to build another house on his property. Teresa testified that her father told her he would execute a deed to her for the property after the house was built; Jeffrey Sr. said there was no discussion about a deed.</p>
<p id="033fa49e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="230" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-230">p. 230</span>Construction of the new house began in the summer of 2003 and was completed in May 2004 at a cost to Teresa of about $200,000. Jeffrey Sr. did a substantial amount of the construction himself, including much of the foundation work, and the carpentry, and helped to get underground electrical lines installed. In January 2004, while construction of the house was underway, Teresa lent $25,000 to her brother, Jeffrey Dow Jr. The record indicates that by the spring of 2004, around the time the house was completed, the relationship between Teresa and her parents and brother began to deteriorate over when and how the loan from Teresa to Jeffrey was to be repaid, and over the Dows’ dissatisfaction with Teresa’s partner, who lived with her. Eventually Teresa sued Jeffrey Jr. for the money, and the Dows filed a grandparents’ rights action to see Teresa’s children.</p>
<p id="033fa49f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At some point after moving into her new house, Teresa began to ask Jeffrey Sr. for a deed so that she could obtain a mortgage to finance other projects. After a period of discussion, it became clear that the Dows were not going to execute a deed. At the time of trial, Teresa was paying the taxes on the house itself, but she was not paying the property taxes or any rent. Both Kathryn Dow and Jeffrey Jr. testified that they had no knowledge of Jeffrey Sr. ever offering or agreeing to deed any land to Teresa.</p>
<p id="033fa4a0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In March 2006, Teresa filed a seven-count complaint in the Superior Court, primarily seeking a judgment compelling the Dows to convey unspecified real property to her, or for damages on her claims of breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and fraud. The Dows counterclaimed, seeking a judgment declaring that Teresa had no rights in their property. Following a two-day bench trial, the court found for the Dows on the real property claims and on their request for a declaratory judgment. Based on her assertion that the court failed to address whether she was entitled to a judgment on a theory of promissory estoppel, Teresa filed motions for further findings, to amend the judgment, and for a new trial. In a written decision, the court recognized that Teresa’s argument was properly raised and then rejected it, finding that “[the Dows’] statements were not promises that could be enforced even if they were the subject of detrimental reliance,” and concluding that “the plaintiffs have not established that Harvey received an offer or promise that can be enforced in this action.” This appeal followed.</p>

The Superior Court agreed that the Dows made general promises to convey land to Teresa, but concluded that they were too indefinite to enforce because there was no agreement on basic elements such as the boundaries or size of the property involved.

However, the evidence included an important second component: the Dows’ acquiescence, support, and encouragement of Teresa’s construction of a house upon the property and the application of section 90 of the Restatement of Contracts to those facts. Neither the initial decision and judgment nor the order on Teresa’s motion for findings of fact addressed these critical points.</p>

It defines a “promise” as “a manifestation of intention to act or refrain from acting in a specified way, so made as to justify a promisee in understanding that a commitment has been made.” Restatement (Second) of Contracts §2(1) (1981); <i>see</i> §90, reporters’ note cmt. a (stating that “[o]n the meaning of ‘promise,’ see §2”). Jeffrey Dow Sr.’s actions in approving the site of Teresa’s house, obtaining a building permit for it, and then building a substantial part of it himself at that location would seem to be “manifestation[s] of [his] intention to act . . . in a specified way”—namely a manifestation of his intent to confirm his general promise to convey land to Teresa and to direct it to that specific parcel.</p>

From those actions, a promise by the Dows to convey that specific site could be fairly implied. Neither the absence of an explicitly articulated promise, nor the absence of consideration is a bar to enforcing that promise. The Superior Court erred in failing to consider the Dows’ actions, in conjunction with their generalized statements, in determining whether the existence of a promissory estoppel is established on these facts. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment and remand the matter to the Superior Court for consideration of the issues identified herein. . . . </p>

<li class=""><p id="033ff2d6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Later history of</i> <b><i>Harvey v. Dow.</i></b> After the decision reported above, the <i>Harvey</i> case was returned to the Maine Superior Court, which then ruled that the plaintiff was not entitled to relief because it was not clear when the promised performance was to have been rendered by the defendants. On appeal from that decision, the Supreme Judicial Court held that it was clear from the facts that the defendants had implicitly promised the plaintiff a present conveyance of the land. This time the court remanded the case with directions to the court below to enter judgment for the plaintiff, and to determine the proper remedy for defendant’s breach in light of the text of Restatement (Second) §90 and its Comment <i>d.</i> Harvey v. Dow, 11A.3d 303 (Me. 2011).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="033ff2d7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The evolution of promissory estoppel.</i> While the rule of Restatement (Second) §90 is usually referred to as “promissory estoppel,” you will note that the text of the section does not use that term. In addition to providing a convenient label, the term “promissory estoppel” is useful in distinguishing promissory estoppel from its doctrinal forerunner, “equitable estoppel.” The doctrine of equitable estoppel (sometimes called “estoppel in pais”) is generally said to apply where one party has made a misstatement of fact, rather than a promise. In its traditional form, equitable estoppel can be seen at work in cases like Hetchler v. American Life Insurance Co., 254 N.W. 221 (Mich. 1934) (insurance company estopped to assert true expiration date of life insurance policy where the insured relied on company’s statement of later date by failing to extend term of policy before his death). The doctrine is still recognized today, although it is normally applied defensively. See Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Ryan, 939 N.E.2d 891, 921 (Ohio Ct. App. 2010) (holding that equitable estoppel is an affirmative defense rather than the basis of a claim for damages). Prior to the solidification <span title="234" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-234">p. 234</span>of promissory estoppel as a doctrine in the 1930s, some courts employed the doctrine of equitable estoppel to enforce promises made between family members, in circumstances where today promissory estoppel would probably apply. E.g., Ricketts v. Scothorn, 77 N.W. 365 (Neb. 1898) (promissory note given by grandfather to induce granddaughter to stop work enforced under doctrine of equitable estoppel).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="033ff2d8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Promissory estoppel in the family context.</i> Harvey v. Dow is a recent case, but promissory estoppel has been used as a basis for enforcement of a promise in the absence of a contract in a family setting since the inception of promissory estoppel. One such early case was Greiner v. Greiner, 293 P. 759 (Kan. 1930), in which a Kansas court held the defendant had made an enforceable promise to give her son an 80-acre tract of land, inducing him to move from another part of the state.</p>
<p id="033ff2d9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both <i>Harvey</i> and <i>Greiner</i> involved claimed promises to convey land, but the application of promissory estoppel in the family context is not limited to this fact pattern. One example is Wright v. Newman, 467 S.E.2d 533 (Ga. 1996). In <i>Wright</i> the plaintiff Newman sought child support for her son and daughter from Wright. Wright admitted paternity of the daughter, but not of the son, and DNA testing established that he was not the father of the boy. The Georgia Supreme Court held that a legally enforceable obligation to provide child support was not limited to principles of family law but could be based on contract doctrine, including promissory estoppel. The court found that Wright had listed himself on the child’s birth certificate as his father and had given the child his name, even though he knew at that time that he was not the child’s father. In addition, for more than ten years he allegedly held himself out to others as the child’s father. These actions were sufficient to amount to a promise to provide child support, the court held, because he knew that parents had a legal obligation to do so.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="033ff2da-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Necessity of an express promise</i>. In <i>Harvey</i> the Dows did not make an express promise to convey to Teresa the land on which she had built her house, but the court was willing to imply such a promise because Mr. Dow’s actions in approving the site for the house, obtaining a building permit, and then building a portion of the house himself were a “manifestation of intention” sufficient to amount to a promise. Similarly, in Wright v. Newman, Note 3 above, the defendant did not make an express promise to support the child, but the court implied a promise from Wright’s actions. Courts seem to have generally recognized that an estoppel, whether promissory or equitable, can be based on conduct as well as an express promise. E.g., Nappi v. Nappi Distributors, 691 A.2d 1198 (Me. 1997) (promise may be implied from conduct). The court in <i>Harvey</i> cited <i>Nappi</i> with approval. However, some courts may require a clear express promise. See Simpson v. Murkowski, 129 P.3d 435 (Alaska 2006) (promissory estoppel requires actual promise that is very clear). Do you agree with the view that promissory estoppel can be based on an implied promise?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="033ff2db-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>When is reliance reasonable?</i>  In its discussion of the plaintiff’s claim of promissory estoppel, the <i>Harvey</i> court spends most of its time on the issue of “promise” — whether the defendant had expressly or implicitly made a <span title="235" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-235">p. 235</span>commitment to the plaintiff sufficient to justify her claim of compensable detrimental reliance. Restatement (Second) §90, quoted by the court, provides (as did its predecessor in the first Restatement) that the promisee’s reliance be “foreseeable,” but does not specifically require that it be “reasonable.” However, the section is captioned “Promise Reasonably Inducing Action or Forbearance,” and Comment <i>b</i> to that section states that the requirement that enforcement be necessary to avoid “injustice” may depend in part on whether the promisee’s change of position in reliance on the promise was reasonable. This may involve two possibly distinguishable issues: Whether it was reasonable for the plaintiff to rely at all, and whether the manner and degree of her reliance was reasonable. Does the plaintiff’s reliance in the <i>Harvey</i> case pass that two-pronged test?</p>
<p id="033ff2dc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a claim of reliance stems from an intra-family transaction, it is natural to assume that the promisee was justified in expecting the promisor to perform his promise, because of the familial relationship between them. E.g., both <i>Harvey</i> and the <i>Greiner</i> case discussed in Note 3, above. But in cases like these, it often appears that the plaintiff promisee did not seek legal counsel until after she had substantially relied on the promisor’s apparent commitment to perform. Suppose that at the time she relied on the defendant’s promise, the plaintiff had actually possessed sufficient knowledge of the rules of contract law to know that the promise made to her would not be enforceable under ordinary contract principles — because of lack of consideration, failure to satisfy the statute of frauds (discussed in the next chapter), or some other legal rule. Would that knowledge render her reliance on the promisor’s apparent commitment “unreasonable”? In Bouton v. Byers, 32l P.3d 780 (Kan. Ct. App. 2014), the plaintiff alleged that she was induced by her father to leave her job as a law professor and come to work for him on his cattle ranch, by promises that he would bequeath to her land worth over $1 million. He later disinherited her, after several years of reliance on her part. In granting summary judgment for the father in the daughter’s suit for reliance damages, the trial court gave as one of its reasons for dismissing her claim the plaintiff’s “education and the circumstances as a whole.” The Appellate Court responded to that finding as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="033ff2dd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We pause over the district court’s reference to Bouton’s education. The district court no doubt meant Bouton’s legal training and her abilities as a capable and respected law professor. The district court apparently presumed that someone with that background would insist on a legally enforceable written agreement or contract memorializing a promise to transfer land. Most lawyers and law professors — and business executives, for that matter — surely recognize the benefits of written agreements to order their professional and financial affairs. And they would agree with the abstract proposition that oral promises may be difficult to enforce. But none of that translates into a rule depriving members of those groups of claims based on promissory estoppel as a matter of law. The district court’s ruling, however, would have it that way.</p>
<p id="033ff2de-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reasonableness of reliance is quintessentially a fact question. Bouton’s training and expertise do not change it to one that can be decided as a matter of law on this record. The district court’s willingness to fashion that sort of a <span title="236" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-236">p. 236</span>bar seems particularly inappropriate given the familial aspects of the dispute. The parties are father and daughter, not disembodied corporations undertaking a joint venture purely for business advantage. The land promised arguably appeared to be the family ranch rather than some portion of Byers’ other real estate holdings. Leading up to the disputed promise, Bouton sought to help Byers at least partly out of a sense of fealty and devotion resting on their blood relationship. In turn, that relationship arguably caused Bouton to leave her sharper legal instincts in the classroom. All of those circumstances ought to be for the factfinder assessing reasonableness in a trial setting rather than on the inanimate summary judgment record of affidavits and deposition excerpts.</p>

<p id="033ff2df-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Id. at 798. See also Charles L. Knapp, Rescuing Reliance: The Perils of Promissory Estoppel, 49 Hastings L.J. 1191, 1286-1296 (1998) (arguing that reasonableness of reliance should depend on reasonableness of promisee’s expectation that promisor will voluntarily perform, not the belief that promisor could be legally compelled to do so).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="033ff2e0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Detrimental reliance.</i> Although the text of Restatement (Second) §90 speaks only of enforcement in order to avoid “injustice,” the section is routinely referred to as protecting “detrimental reliance.” In fact, the degree of detrimental reliance may be the most significant element in judicial determination that promissory estoppel should be invoked. In both <i>Harvey</i> and <i>Greiner</i>, while the existence of a promise was contested, the reliance was substantial: building of the home on parents’ land in <i>Harvey</i> and moving from another part of the state in <i>Greiner</i>. When detrimental reliance is not so clear, a court may be less willing to apply promissory estoppel. In Wright v. Newman the Georgia Supreme Court found that the mother had detrimentally relied on Wright’s implied promise to provide child support by refraining from seeking support from the child’s natural father. According to the majority opinion, had she done so she might have had a source of financial support and the child might have received emotional support from the actual father. In dissent the Chief Justice argued that Newman had presented no evidence that she could have obtained child support from the actual father or that she was unable to do so at the time of the suit.</p></li>

Once plans for construction of a library to house new holdings were firm, the newly appointed director of special collections, Dr. Howard Gotlieb, began his efforts to obtain Dr. King’s papers.

<p id="03404114-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On this 16th day of July, 1964, I name the Boston University Library the Repository of my correspondence, manuscripts and other papers, along with a few of my awards and other materials which may come to be of interest in historical or other research.</p>
<p id="03404115-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In accordance with this action I have authorized the removal of most of the above-mentioned papers and other objects to Boston University, including most correspondence through 1961, at once. It is my intention that after the end of each calendar year, similar files of materials for an additional year should be sent to Boston University.</p>
<p id="03404116-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All papers and other objects which thus pass into the custody of Boston University remain my legal property until otherwise indicated, according to the statements below. However, if, despite scrupulous care, any such materials are damaged or lost while in custody of Boston University, I absolve Boston University of responsibility to me for such damage or loss.</p>
<p id="03404117-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I intend each year to indicate a portion of the materials deposited with Boston University to become the absolute property of Boston University as an outright gift from me, until all shall have been thus given to the University.

BU asserts that the evidence was sufficient to raise a question of fact for the jury as to whether there was a promise by Dr. King to transfer title to his papers to BU and whether any such promise was supported by consideration or reliance by BU. We agree.</p>
<p id="0340411a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">II. <i>Evidence of an enforceable charitable pledge.</i><span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN102D5_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N102D5_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">3</a></span> Because the jury found that BU had acquired rightful ownership of the papers via a charitable pledge, but not a contract, we review the case on that basis. We note at the outset that there is scant Massachusetts case law in the area of charitable pledges and subscriptions.</p>
<p id="0340411c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A charitable subscription is “an oral or written promise to do certain acts or to give real or personal property to a charity or for a charitable purpose.” See generally E.L. Fisch, D.J. Freed, &amp; E.R. Schacter, Charities and Charitable Foundations §63, at 77 (1974). To enforce a charitable subscription or a charitable pledge in Massachusetts, a party must establish that there was a promise to give some property to a charitable institution and that the promise was supported by consideration or reliance. Congregation Kadimah Toras-Moshe v. DeLeo, 405 Mass. 365, 367 &amp; n.3, 540 N.E.2d 691 (1989), and cases cited therein.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN102E1_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N102E1_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">4</a></span> See In re Morton 1200 Shoe Co., 40 B.R. 948 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1984) (discussing Massachusetts law of charitable subscriptions).</p>
<p id="0340411f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The jurors were asked two special questions regarding BU’s affirmative defense of rightful ownership by way of a charitable pledge: (1) “Does the letter, dated July 16, 1964, from Martin Luther King, Jr., to [BU], set forth a promise by <span title="240" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-240">p. 240</span>Dr. King to transfer ownership of his papers to [BU]?”; and (2) “Did [BU] take action in reliance on that promise or was that promise supported by consideration?” In determining whether the case properly was submitted to the jury, we consider first, whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain a conclusion that the letter contained a promise to make a gift and second, whether the evidence was sufficient to support a determination that any promise found was supported by consideration or reliance.</p>
<p id="03404120-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">III(A). <i>Evidence of a promise to make a gift.</i> The plaintiff argues that the terms of the letter promising “to indicate a portion of the materials deposited with [BU] to become the absolute property of [BU] as an outright gift . . . until all shall have been thus given to [BU],” could not as a matter of basic contract law constitute a promise sufficient to establish an inter vivos charitable pledge because there is no indication of a bargained for exchange which would have bound Dr. King to his promise. The plaintiff asserts that the above-quoted excerpt (hereinafter “first statement”) from the letter merely described an unenforceable “unilateral and gratuitous mechanism by which he might” make a gift of the papers in the future but by which he was not bound. In support of her position that Dr. King did not intend to bind himself to his statement of intent to make a gift of the papers he deposited with BU, the plaintiff points to the language which appears above the promise to make gifts of the deposited papers that “[a]ll papers and other objects which thus pass into the custody of [BU] remain my legal property until otherwise indicated, according to the statements below.” According to the plaintiff, because of Dr. King’s initial retention of legal ownership, BU could not reasonably rely on the letter’s statements of intent to make a gift of the papers. We do not agree.</p>
<p id="03404121-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The letter contains two sentences which might reasonably be construed as a promise to give personal property to a charity or for a charitable purpose. The first statement, quoted above, is that Dr. King intended in subsequent installments to transfer title to portions of the papers in BU’s custody until all the papers in its custody became its property. The second statement immediately follows the first, expressing an intent that “[i]n the event of [Dr. King’s] death, all . . . materials deposited with [BU] shall become from that date the absolute property of [BU]” (hereinafter “second statement”). BU claims that these two sentences should be read together as a promise to make a gift of all of the papers deposited with it at some point between the first day of deposit and at the very latest, on Dr. King’s death.</p>
<p id="03404122-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before analyzing the first and second statements, we note the considerations governing our review. A primary concern in enforcing charitable subscriptions, as with enforcement of other gratuitous transfers such as gifts and trusts, is ascertaining the intention of the donor. . . . If donative intent is sufficiently clear, we shall give effect to that intent to the extent possible without abandoning basic contractual principles, such as specificity of the donor’s promise, consideration, and reasonableness of the charity’s reliance. <i>DeLeo,</i> supra 405 Mass. at 368 n.5, 540 N.E.2d 691. In determining the intention of Dr. King as expressed in the letter and the understanding BU had of that letter, we look first to the language of the letter, in its entirety, but also consider the circumstances and relationship of the parties with respect to the papers.</p>
<p id="03404123-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="241" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-241">p. 241</span>III(A)(1). <i>First statement.</i> Regarding the first statement, the plaintiff contends that it is not a promise but a mere statement of intent to do something in the future. . . . However, our interpretation of that first statement is strongly influenced by the bailor-bailee relationship the letter unequivocally establishes between Dr. King and BU.</p>
<p id="03404124-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A bailment is established by “delivery of personalty for some particular purpose, or on mere deposit, upon a contract, express or implied, that after the purpose has been fulfilled it shall be redelivered to the person who delivered it, or otherwise dealt with according to his directions, or kept until he reclaims it, as the case may be.” 9 S. Williston, Contracts §1030 (3d ed. 1967), quoting State v. Warwick, 48 Del. 568, 576, 108 A.2d 85 (1954). . . . The terms of the letter establish a bailment in which certain “correspondence, manuscripts and other papers, along with a few of [Dr. King’s] awards” were placed in “the custody of [BU].” The bailed papers were to “remain [Dr. King’s] legal property until otherwise indicated.” By accepting delivery of the papers, BU assumed the duty of care as bailee set forth in the letter, that of “scrupulous care.” . . . </p>
<p id="03404125-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Generally there will be a case for the jury as to donative intent if property allegedly promised to a charity or other eleemosynary institution is placed by the donor in the custody of the donee.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1031A_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1031A_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">5</a></span> The bailor-bailee relationship established in the letter could be viewed by a rational factfinder as a security for the promise to give a gift in the future of the bailed property, and thus as evidence in addition to the statement in the letter of an intent of the donor to be bound. Furthermore, while we have been unwilling to abandon fundamental principles of contract law in determining the enforceability of charitable subscriptions, see <i>DeLeo,</i> supra 405 Mass. at 368 n.4, 540 N.E.2d 691, second par. (declining to adopt Restatement [Second] of Contracts rule that charitable subscriptions enforceable without consideration or reliance where justice so requires), we do recognize that the “meeting of minds” between a donor and a charitable institution differs from the understanding we require in the context of enforceable arm’s-length commercial agreements. Charities depend on donations for their existence, whereas their donors may give personal property on conditions they choose, with or without imposing conditions or demanding consideration. In re Field’s Will, 15 Misc. 2d 950, 951, 181 N.Y.S.2d 922 (1959), modified, 11 A.D.2d 774, 204 N.Y.S.2d 947 (1960) (“Charitable subscription agreements can rarely be regarded as part of a bargaining agreement that provide for a quid pro quo”). In combination with the letter and in the context of a disputed pledge to a charity, the bailment of Dr. King’s letters provided sufficient evidence of donative intent to submit to the jury the questions whether there was a promise to <span title="242" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-242">p. 242</span>transfer ownership of the bailed property and whether there was consideration or reliance on that promise.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1032A_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1032A_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">6</a></span></p>
<p id="03406839-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">III(A)(2). <i>Second statement.</i> [The second statement in Dr. King’s letter — “In the event of my death, all such materials deposited with the University shall become from that date the absolute property of Boston University” — posed an additional legal issue because it did not take effect until his death. The plaintiff argued that this statement amounted to a will and that it was therefore unenforceable because it failed to comply with the statutory formalities for a will, including the requirement of at least two subscribing witnesses. The court rejected this argument. It found that the statute of wills did not prevent a person from making a contract or a promise to take effect at his death, and that was what Dr. King had done. — <span class="epub-small-caps">Eds</span>.]</p>
<p id="0340683a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">III(B). <i>Evidence of consideration or reliance.</i> The judge did not err in submitting the second question on charitable pledge, regarding whether there was consideration for or reliance on the promise, to the jury. “It may be found somewhat difficult to reconcile all the views which have been taken, in the various cases that have arisen upon the validity of promises, where the ground of defence has been that they were gratuitous and without consideration.” Ives v. Sterling, 6 Met. 310, 315 (1843). There was evidence that BU undertook indexing of the papers, made the papers available to researchers, and provided trained staff to care for the papers and assist researchers. BU held a convocation to commemorate receipt of the papers. Dr. King spoke at the convocation. In a speech at that time, he explained why he chose BU as the repository for his papers.</p>
<p id="0340683b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As we explained above, the letter established that so long as BU, as bailee, attended the papers with “scrupulous care,” Dr. King, as bailor, would release them from liability for “any such materials . . . damaged or lost while in [its] custody.” The jury could conclude that certain actions of BU, including indexing of the papers, went beyond the obligations BU assumed as a bailee to attend the papers with “scrupulous care” and constituted reliance or consideration for the promises Dr. King included in the letter to transfer ownership of all bailed papers to BU at some future date or at his death. Trustees of Amherst Academy v. Cowls, 6 Pick. 427, 431 (1828) (“It seems that an actual benefit to the promisor, or an actual loss or disadvantage to the promisee, will be a sufficient consideration to uphold a promise deliberately made. Whether the consideration received is equal in value to the sum promised to be paid, seems not to be <span title="243" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-243">p. 243</span>material to the validity of a note . . . ”); <i>Ives,</i> supra at 317-319; Ladies’ Collegiate Inst. v. French, 16 Gray 196, 202 (1860).</p>
<p id="0340683c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issue before us is not whether we agree with the jury’s verdict but whether the case was properly submitted to the jury. We conclude that the letter could have been read to contain a promise supported by consideration or reliance; “[t]he issue [of whether transfer of ownership to BU was transferred by way of a charitable pledge by Dr. King] was, therefore, properly submitted to the jury, and their verdicts, unless otherwise untenable, must stand.” Carr v. Arthur D. Little, Inc., 348 Mass. 469, 474, 204 N.E.2d 466 (1965) (evidence sufficient as matter of contract law to raise question of fact for jury as to existence of common employment). . . . </p>

See Salsbury v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 221 N.W.2d 609 (Iowa 1974); In re Schmidt, 723 N.W. 2d 454 (Table), 2006 W.L. 2561231 (Iowa Ct. App.) <i>(Salsbury</i> holding not limited to written promise; oral pledge to church for building projects enforceable against estate). The <i>Salsbury</i> court offered the following rationale for its decision: “Charitable subscriptions often serve the public interest by making possible projects which otherwise could never come about. . . . [In addition,] where a subscription is unequivocal the pledgor should be made to keep his word.” 221 N.W. 2d at 613.</p>
<p id="03406842-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>King</i> the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts joins several other courts that have rejected §90(2), but it does not offer any reasons for refusing to accept the Restatement recommendation. In Maryland National Bank v. United Jewish Appeal Federation, 407 A.2d 1130 (Md. 1979), the Maryland court justified its rejection of §90(2) on the following grounds:</p>

<p id="03406843-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">UJA would have us “view traditional contract law requirements of consideration liberally” in order to maintain what it believes to be a judicial policy of favoring charities. We deeply appreciate the fact that private philanthropy serves a highly important function in our society. . . . But we are not persuaded <span title="244" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-244">p. 244</span>that we should, by judicial fiat, adopt a policy of favoring charities at the expense of the law of contracts which has been long established in this state. We do not think that this law should be disregarded or modified so as to bestow a preferred status upon charitable organizations and institutions. It may be that there are cases in which judgments according to the law do not appear to subserve the purposes of justice, but this, ordinarily, the courts may not remedy. “It is safer that a private right should fail, or a wrong go unredressed, than that settled principles should be disregarded in order to meet the equity of a particular case.” . . . If change is to be made it should be by legislative enactment, as in the matter of the tax status of charitable organizations.</p>

What effect do you think it would have on charitable organizations and their potential financial supporters?

<li class=""><p id="03406845-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Other case examples.</i> Of course, even the adoption of Restatement (Second) §90(2) would not necessarily mean that every charitable subscription is enforceable. See, e.g., In re Bashas’ Inc., 468 B.R. 381 (D. Ariz. 2012). In this bankruptcy proceeding a charitable medical organization sought to hold the bankruptcy estate of the debtors (apparently related business corporations) liable for promises of annual charitable gifts to be used toward construction of a medical facility. The bankruptcy court disallowed the claim, finding that the debtors’ promises were made without consideration, and that promissory estoppel did not apply. On appeal, after finding that no consideration was given for the defendants’ pledge, the U.S. District Court went on to affirm dismissal of the claim of promissory estoppel:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03406846-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Arizona has adopted the definition of promissory estoppel found in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 90(1) (1981). . . . The bankruptcy court found the appellants’ claimed reliance “not credible,” noting that the Barrow Tower was completed despite debtors’ contribution of only a fraction of their pledged amount. Memorandum Decision at 3. We agree. There was no detrimental reliance here. Nor is there any injustice.

<p id="03406847-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court then considered subsection 2 of § 90, which provides that “[a] charitable subscription or a marriage settlement is binding under Subsection (1) without proof that the promise induced action or forbearance.” Although Arizona has not adopted subsection 2, appellants urged the bankruptcy court to apply this provision. It declined, preferring to “tread the more conventional path” by requiring consideration or reliance to make a charitable pledge enforceable. Memorandum Decision at 2. As of 2005, only two states, Iowa and New Jersey, appeared to have adopted subsection 2 of § 90.

<p id="03406848-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We doubt whether Arizona would or should adopt § 90(2). But even if it did, the promise is still not enforceable. While subsection 2 dispenses with subsection 1’s requirement of reliance, the element of injustice still must be satisfied. Appellants have not shown that injustice can only be avoided by enforcement of this promise. Debtors experienced an extreme negative change in their economic situation after making the pledge. Appellants finished construction of Barrow Tower without the promised donations. Their existence was not threatened because the pledge was not paid, nor did they enter into binding contracts or suffer liabilities in reliance on the pledge. There is no evidence that other donors made pledges in consideration of the debtors’ promise.</p>

<p id="03408e5a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While courts have generally refused to adopt Restatement (Second) §90(2), they have on the whole been sympathetic to the claims of charitable organizations to enforce pledges. In the leading case of Allegheny College v. National Chautauqua County Bank, 159 N.E.173 (1927), Judge Cardozo of the New York Court of Appeals held that a pledge to the plaintiff college by a donor, later deceased, was binding contractually on the ground that the college made an “implied promise” to memorialize the donor’s name, thus creating an enforceable bilateral contract. In “dictum” (statements by a court not necessary to the decision of the case) Cardozo also indicated that the doctrine of promissory estoppel could be used to enforce donative promises that had been relied on by charities. Cardozo suggested that the willingness of courts to find liability on the basis of either a contract or promissory estoppel rested on public policy. In a later New York case, Woodmere Academy v. Steinberg, 363 N.E.2d 1169 (N.Y. 1977), the New York Court of Appeals enforced Mr. Steinberg’s pledge in the unpaid amount of $200,000. Steinberg decided not to honor the pledge because he had moved from the community, his children were no longer attending the Academy, and he had decided to redirect the funds to support the State of Israel. The Court rejected Steinberg’s argument that the Academy had failed to honor various conditions to the pledge, noting that “as a matter of public policy, pledge agreements calculated to enforce eleemosynary enterprises are enforceable.” Id. at 1172. On the facts of the case, Steinberg’s pledge was probably enforceable either on the basis of consideration or promissory estoppel because the Academy had renamed its library in honor of Steinberg’s wife.

Although there was substantial evidence that the promise was in fact made and adhered to by the decedent during her lifetime, the original promise was oral and informally made. While upholding the enforceability of the gift, the court cautioned both donors and charities against treating such gifts casually. Urging charities to adhere to “prudent business methods,” the court noted that informality exposes donors (or their estates) to the risk of unforeseen tax problems. And, the court observed, even charities that are successful in obtaining court enforcement of casually made pledges may suffer harm: Potential donors could become more reticent about making gifts. In connection with the court’s admonition about the dangers of informal practices by charities, consider the problem below.</p></li>

<p id="0340b585-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although significant amounts of money or property were often at stake, the cases examined earlier in this section did not involve transactions of the sort one ordinarily thinks of as commercial. Of course, one might view the operation of modern charitable organizations as commercial in every sense other than profitmaking; many of them receive and pay millions of dollars each year and in the course of their activities enter into all kinds of contracts for goods and services. (Cf. the suggestion in UCC §2-104, Comment 2 that for some purposes a university — and, presumably, other nonprofit entities such as a hospital or even a church — should be considered a “merchant,” as that term is used in the Code.) But the promises of contributions made to charities have generally been viewed by donor and donee alike as essentially gratuitous, made from altruistic motives rather than for the purpose of reciprocal financial gain.</p>
<p id="0340b586-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In its early days, the principle of promissory estoppel was often viewed as appropriately confined to the noncommercial sphere, with one significant exception: employee benefit or pension cases. You will recall from the <i>Plowman</i> 
<span title="248" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-248">p. 248</span>case that an employer’s promise to pay a pension or other benefit at or after retirement might not satisfy the requirement of bargained-for exchange. Professor Boyer’s history of promissory estoppel showed that employee bonus and pension plan cases made an important contribution to the genesis of §90. In fact, one of the few illustrations to the original Restatement §90 presented such a case:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">

<p id="0340b588-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In his 1960 survey of the case law under §90, however, Professor Stanley Henderson concluded that promissory estoppel had outgrown any earlier limitations and that protection of unbargained-for reliance on commercial promises had become its principal application. Stanley D. Henderson, Promissory Estoppel and Traditional Contract Doctrine, 78 Yale L.J. 343, 343-344 (1960). In this section we examine a few situations in which courts have employed the doctrine to enforce commercial promises even in the absence of consideration.</p>

<p id="0340dc9f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I. G. Katz filed three suits in the Associate Division of the Circuit Court seeking pension payments for three separate time periods alleged to be due from Danny Dare, Inc. Two suits resulted in judgment in favor of Katz, but a request for a trial de novo was filed and those cases were assigned to a circuit judge for trial. The other suit pending in the Associate Division was transferred to the same circuit judge and all the cases were consolidated for trial without a jury. Judgment was entered in favor of Dare in all cases. On this appeal Katz contends the promise of pension payments made to him by Dare is binding under the Doctrine of Promissory Estoppel. Reversed and remanded.</p>
<p id="0340dca0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is little or no dispute as to the facts in this case. Katz began work for Dare in 1950 and continued in that employ until his retirement on June 1, 1975. The president of Dare was Harry Shopmaker, who was also the brother of Katz’s wife. Katz worked in a variety of positions including executive vice president, sales manager, and a member of the board of directors, although he was not a member of the board at the time of his retirement. In February 1973, Katz was opening a store, operated by Dare, for business and placed a bag of money on the counter next to the cash register. A man walked in, picked up the bag of money and left. When Katz followed him and attempted to retrieve the money, Katz was struck in the head. He was hospitalized and even though he returned to work he conceded he had some difficulties. His walk was impaired and he suffered some memory loss and was not able to function as he had <span title="249" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-249">p. 249</span>before. Shopmaker and others testified to many mistakes which Katz made after his return at considerable cost to Dare. Shopmaker reached the decision that he would have to work out some agreeable pension to induce Katz to retire because he did not feel he could carry Katz as an employee. At that time Katz’s earnings were about $23,000 per year.</p>
<p id="0340dca1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Shopmaker began discussions with Katz concerning retirement but Katz insisted that he did not want to retire but wanted to continue working. Katz was 65 at the time of his injury and felt he could continue performing useful work for Dare to justify his remaining as an employee. However, Shopmaker persisted in his assessment that Katz was more of a liability than an asset as an employee and continued negotiating with Katz over a period of about 13 months in an effort to reach an agreement by which Katz would retire with a pension from Dare. Shopmaker first offered Katz $10,500 per year as a pension but Katz refused. Thereafter, while Katz was on vacation, Shopmaker sent Katz a letter to demonstrate how Katz could actually wind up with more take-home pay by retiring than he could by continuing as an employee. In the letter Shopmaker proposed an annual pension payable by Dare of $13,000, added the Social Security benefit which Katz and his wife would receive after retirement, and added $2,520 per year which Katz could earn for part-time employment, but not necessarily from Dare, to demonstrate that Katz would actually realize about $1,000 per year more in income by retiring with the Dare pension over what he would realize if he continued his employment. Shopmaker testified that he sent this letter in an effort to persuade Katz to retire.</p>
<p id="0340dca2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Katz acceded to the offer of a pension of $13,000 per year for life, and on May 22, 1975, the board of directors of Dare unanimously approved the following resolution:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="0340dca3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">WHEREAS, I. G. Katz has been a loyal employee of Danny Dare, Inc. and its predecessor companies for more than 25 years; and,</p>

<p id="0340dca6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">NOW THEN BE IT RESOLVED, that Danny Dare, Inc. pay to I. G. Katz the sum of $500.00 bi-weekly, or a total of $13,000.00 per year, so long as he shall live.</p>
</div>
<p id="0340dca7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Katz retired on June 1, 1975, at age 67, and Dare began payment of the pension at the rate of $500 every other week. Katz testified that he would not have retired without the pension and relied on the promise of Dare to pay the pension when he made his decision to retire. Shopmaker testified that at the time the board resolution was passed, the board intended for Katz to rely on the resolution and to retire, but he said Katz would have been fired had he not elected to retire.</p>
<p id="034103b8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the Fall of 1975, Katz began working for another company on 3 to 4 half-days per week. At the end of that year Shopmaker asked Katz if he could do part-time work for Dare and Katz told him he could work one-half day on <span title="250" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-250">p. 250</span>Wednesdays. For the next two and one-half years Katz continued to work for Dare one-half day per week.</p>
<p id="034103b9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In July, 1978, Dare sent a semi-monthly check for $250 instead of $500. Katz sent the check back and stated he was entitled to the full $500. Thereafter Dare stopped sending any checks. Shopmaker testified that he cut off the checks to Katz because he felt Katz’s health had improved to the point that he could work, as demonstrated by the part-time job he held. Katz testified the decrease was made after Shopmaker told him he would have to work one-half day for five days a week for Dare or his pension would be cut in half. Katz testified, without challenge, that he was not able to work 40 hours per week in 1978 at age 70.</p>
<p id="034103ba-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court entered a judgment in which some findings of fact were made. The court found that Katz based his claim on the Doctrine of Promissory Estoppel as applied in Feinberg v. Pfeiffer Company, 322 S.W.2d 163 (Mo. App. 1959). The court found that Katz was not in the same situation as Feinberg had been because Katz faced the prospect of being fired if he did not accept the pension offer whereas there was no such evidence in the <i>Feinberg</i> case. The court found the pension from Dare did not require Katz to do anything and he was in fact free to work for another company. The court found Katz did not give up anything to which he was legally entitled when he elected to retire. The court found that since Katz had the choice of accepting retirement and a pension or being fired, that it could not be said that he suffered any detriment or significant change of position when he elected to retire. The court further found that it could not find any injustice resulting to Katz because by the time payments had been terminated, he had received about $40,000 plus a paid vacation for his wife and himself to Hawaii. The court found these were benefits he would not have received had he been fired.</p>
<p id="034103bb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Katz contends he falls within the holding in <i>Feinberg</i> and Dare contends that because Katz faced the alternative of accepting the pension or being fired that he falls without the holding in <i>Feinberg.</i></p>
<p id="034103bc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the outset it is interesting to note in view of the argument made by Dare that the court in <i>Feinberg</i> stated at p. 165:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="034103bd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is clear from the evidence that there was no contract, oral or written, as to plaintiff’s length of employment, and that she was free to quit, and the defendant to discharge her, at any time.</p>
</div>
<p id="034103be-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Feinberg</i> the board of directors passed a resolution offering Feinberg the opportunity to retire at any time she would elect with retirement pay of $200 per month for life. Feinberg retired about two and one-half years after the resolution was passed and began to receive the retirement pay. The pay continued for about seven years when the company sent a check for $100 per month, which Feinberg refused and thereafter payments were discontinued.</p>
<p id="034103bf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court observed that Section 90 of the Restatement of the Law of Contracts had been adopted by the Supreme Court in In Re Jamison’s Estate, 202 S.W.2d 879 (Mo. 1947). The court noted that one of the illustrations under <span title="251" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-251">p. 251</span>§90 was strikingly similar to the facts in <i>Feinberg.</i> The court applied the Doctrine of Promissory Estoppel, as articulated in §90, and held that Feinberg had relied upon the promise of the pension when she resigned a paying position and elected to accept a lesser amount in pension. The court held it was immaterial as to whether Feinberg became unable to obtain other employment before or after the company discontinued the pension payment. The court held the reliance by Feinberg was in giving up her job in reliance on the promise of a pension. Her subsequent disability went to the prevention of injustice which is part of the Doctrine of Promissory Estoppel.</p>
<p id="034103c0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are three elements to be satisfied to invoke the Doctrine of Promissory Estoppel. These are: (1) a promise; (2) a detrimental reliance on such promise; and (3) injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.</p>
<p id="034103c1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This court is not convinced that the alternative Shopmaker gave to Katz of either accepting the pension and retiring or be fired takes this case out of the operation of Promissory Estoppel. The fact remains that Katz was not fired, but instead did voluntarily retire, but only after the board of directors had adopted the resolution promising to pay Katz a pension of $13,000 per year for life. Thus, the same facts are present in this case as were present in <i>Feinberg.</i> When Katz elected to retire and give up earnings of about $23,000 per year to accept a pension of $13,000 per year, he did so as a result of a promise made by Dare and to his detriment by the loss of $10,000 per year in earnings. It is conceded Dare intended that Katz rely on its promise of a pension and Dare does not contend Katz did not in fact rely on such promise. The fact that the payments continued for about three years and that Katz at age 70 could not work full-time was unquestioned. Thus, the element that injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise is present, because Katz cannot now engage in a full-time job to return to the earnings which he gave up in reliance on the pension.</p>
<p id="034103c2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dare’s argument that the threat of being fired removes this case from the operation of Promissory Estoppel is similar to an argument advanced in Trexler’s Estate, 27 Pa. Dist. &amp; Co. Rep. 4 (1936), cited with approval in Fried v. Fisher, 328 Pa. 497, 196 A. 39 (1938). In <i>Trexler</i> the depression had forced General Trexler to decide whether to fire several employees who had been with him for many years or place them on a pension. The General decided to promise them a pension of $50 per month and at his death, the employees filed a claim against his estate for the continuation of the payments. The court observed that the General could have summarily discharged the employees, but was loath to do this without making some provision for their old age. This was shown by the numerous conferences which the General had with his executives in considering each employee’s financial situation, age and general status. The court said it was clear that the General wanted to reduce overhead and at the same time wanted to give these faithful employees some protection. The court stated it as an open question of what the General would have done if the men had not accepted his offer of a lifetime pension. The court said it would not speculate on that point but it was sufficient to observe that the men accepted the offer and received the pension. The court applied §90 of the Restatement and held <span title="252" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-252">p. 252</span>that under the Doctrine of Promissory Estoppel the estate was bound to continue the payments.</p>
<p id="034103c3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The facts in this case are strikingly similar to <i>Trexler.</i> Shopmaker undoubtedly wanted to reduce his overhead by reducing the amount being paid to Katz and it is true that Katz could have been summarily discharged. However, it is also true that Shopmaker refused to fire Katz, but instead patiently negotiated for about 13 months to work out a pension which Katz did agree to accept and voluntarily retired.</p>
<p id="034103c4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While Dare strenuously urges that the threat of firing effectively removed any legitimate choice on the part of Katz, the facts do not bear this out. The fact is that Katz continued in his employment with Dare until he retired and such retirement was voluntary on the part of Katz. Had Shopmaker desired to terminate Katz without any promise of a pension he could have done so and Katz would have had no recourse. However, the fact is that Shopmaker did not discharge Katz but actually made every effort to induce Katz to retire voluntarily on the promise of a pension of $13,000 per year.</p>
<p id="03412ad5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dare appears to have led the trial court into error by relying on Pitts v. McGraw-Edison Co., 329 F.2d 412 (6th Cir. 1964). Pitts was informed that the company had retired him and would pay him a certain percentage of sales thereafter. Thus, the main distinction between this case and <i>Pitts</i> is that Pitts did not elect to retire on the promise of any payment, but was simply informed that he had been retired by the company and the company would make payment to him. There was no promise made to Pitts on which he acted to his detriment. In addition, the court was applying the law of Tennessee and the court stated that Tennessee had not adopted §90 of the Restatement. The court in <i>Pitts</i> found that Pitts had not given up anything to which he was legally entitled and was not restricted in any way in his activities after being placed in retirement by his company.</p>
<p id="03412ad6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The facts in <i>Pitts</i> would not enable Pitts to recover under Promissory Estoppel in Missouri because there was no action taken by Pitts in reliance on a promise. The test to be applied in this case is not whether Katz gave up something to which he was legally entitled, but rather whether Dare made a promise to him on which he acted to his detriment. The legally entitled test could never be met by an employee such as Katz or Feinberg because neither could show any legal obligation on the company to promise a pension. The Doctrine of Promissory Estoppel is designed to protect those to whom a promise is made which is not legally enforcible until the requirements of the doctrine are met. <i>Pitts</i> is not applicable either on the facts or the law.</p>
<p id="03412ad7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court misapplied the law when it held that Katz was required to show that he gave up something to which he was legally entitled before he could enforce the promise of a pension made by Dare. The elements of Promissory Estoppel are present: a promise of a pension to Katz, his detrimental reliance thereon, and injustice can only be avoided by enforcing that promise. The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with directions to enter judgment in all suits in favor of Katz for the amount of unpaid pension.</p>

<li class=""><p id="03412adb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>1. Analyzing the</i> <b><i>Katz</i></b> <i>case.</i> The trial court in <i>Katz</i> found that Katz “did not give up anything to which he was legally entitled when he elected to retire.” Was the trial court simply (and mistakenly) applying the test for consideration? Or did it have something else in mind? In the Court of Appeals’ opinion, Judge Turnage states, “The legally entitled test could never be met by an employee such as Katz or Feinberg because neither could show any legal obligation on the company to promise a pension.” Of course, if Danny Dare had already been obligated to pay Katz a pension, then Katz wouldn’t have needed to rely on the doctrine of promissory estoppel to enforce the company’s promise. Can the trial court really have meant something that obvious? Or is the Court of Appeals unfairly representing the trial court’s position? What do you think the trial court probably meant by the “not legally entitled” explanation of its decision? Is its position persuasive?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03412adc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>When is reliance detrimental?</i> Although Restatement §90 does not use the term “detrimental reliance,” that phrase is commonly used to refer to the section’s requirement that the promise induce “action or forbearance” by the promisee. In many actions in which promissory estoppel is involved, the plaintiff will have made actual expenditures in reliance on the promise. Such conduct not only satisfies the requirement of “action or forbearance” in reliance on the promise but also constitutes reliance that is detrimental to the plaintiff. As the <i>Katz</i> case indicates, however, a change of position will often be sufficient to invoke promissory estoppel even if the conduct does not involve an expenditure of funds. E.g., Romano v. Site Acquisitions, LLC, 2017 WL 2634643 at *7 (D.N.H.) (evidence that defendant’s promise of bonus induced plaintiffs to “hustle more and work harder,” to “become more efficient,” and finish work sooner, could support finding of sufficient detrimental reliance to satisfy §90). Further, in some cases a change of position that might be viewed as financially beneficial can nonetheless support an action for promissory estoppel. A case illustrative of such a situation is Vastoler v. American Can Co., 700 F.2d 916 (3d Cir. 1983). Vastoler accepted a promotion to a supervisory position in part because of the employer’s promise of certain pension benefits. When the employer subsequently denied making the promise, Vastoler brought suit on the basis of promissory estoppel. The trial court granted summary judgment for the employer on the ground that Vastoler did not suffer financial loss because he was better off economically having accepted the supervisory position. In reversing that decision, the Court of Appeals made the following remarks on the issue of detrimental reliance:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03412add-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second error in the district court’s reasoning involves an even more fundamental deficiency. It failed to consider the human dynamics and anxieties inherent in supervisory positions. All jobs are not the same, and work involves more than one’s “daily bread” and the weekly paycheck. Certain jobs have higher levels of stress and anxiety. Often, increased responsibilities torture the mind as well as the body. The different levels of stress associated with different jobs explains why some qualified people do not want to be President of Fortune <span title="254" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-254">p. 254</span>500 corporations, nominee for the Presidency of the United States, or foreman of their plants. Some privates do not want the decision-making burdens of majors and generals. . . . </p>
<p id="03412ade-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A jury could certainly find that when Vastoler changed his position from an hourly worker responsible for his individual tasks to a salaried supervisor responsible for approximately fifty subordinate employees he was forced to absorb additional stress and emotional trauma. As a supervisor, he would have had the additional responsibility for assigning jobs to workers, disciplining workers, and perhaps recommending that some be fired or laid off. The stress and emotional trauma inherent in such a supervisory position cannot be measured in purely financial terms. Therefore, the presence of detrimental reliance in this case is a sufficiently disputed issue for the trier of fact that summary judgment cannot be granted to American Can Company.</p>

<li class=""><p id="034151f0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Katz</i></b> <i>compared with</i> <b><i>Hayes</i></b><i>.</i> Not all employees have been as successful as Mr. Katz. In Hayes v. Plantations Steel Co., 438 A.2d 1091 (R.I. 1982), the plaintiff Hayes, after 25 years of employment, announced his decision to retire, effective in six months. One week before his actual date of retirement, Hayes met with an officer of the defendant company, who promised him that the company “would take care” of him. After Hayes’s retirement, the company paid him a pension for four years but stopped doing so because of financial conditions and a change of ownership. The trial court ruled that the company was contractually bound to pay Hayes his pension, but the Supreme Court reversed. The Court first held that even if the company had made a promise, the promise was not supported by consideration. Citing the classical requirement of consideration as bargained-for exchange, the Court concluded that Hayes’s retirement could not constitute consideration because he announced his decision before the company made its promise. For similar reasons the court rejected Hayes’s promissory estoppel theory. Under that theory Hayes was required to show that the promise induced detrimental reliance, and he could not do so because his decision to retire preceded the promise. Do you think the factual differences between <i>Katz</i> and <i>Hayes</i> warrant different legal results? For further discussion and comparison of <i>Katz</i> and <i>Hayes,</i> see Charles L. Knapp, Rescuing Reliance: The Perils of Promissory Estoppel, 49 Hastings L.J. 1191, 1254-1261 (1998).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="034151f1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Promissory estoppel’s role in avoiding “injustice.”</i> In the <i>Katz</i> case, both the trial and appellate courts focused primarily on the issue of detrimental reliance in assessing Katz’s ability to invoke promissory estoppel to enforce Danny Dare’s promises to him. Besides the issues of foreseeable and detrimental reliance, §90 provides that the court should enforce a promise based on the promisee’s reliance only where this action is needed to “prevent injustice.” It appears from the facts recited by the court in <i>Katz</i> that the defendant’s desire to induce Katz to retire was based at least in part on his physical and mental impairment, and that these may have been attributable to the injury he sustained in attempting to retrieve defendant’s property from a thief. If these assumptions are correct, should those facts be relevant to Katz’s ability <span title="255" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-255">p. 255</span>to enforce the defendant’s promises to him? Should it matter whether Katz’s attempt to retrieve the defendant’s money was successful? Lamenting the courts’ tendency to ignore the element of “injustice” when deciding whether to apply promissory estoppel, Professor Orit Gan has argued that the issue of injustice should play a larger role in the jurisprudence of promissory estoppel, and that this could well extend beyond “corrective” to “distributive” justice as well. Reviewing cases in a variety of areas such as employment, lending, insurance and franchising, Professor Gan argues that, particularly where there are imbalances of power between parties, a robust application of the “injustice” prong of promissory estoppel could promote both types of justice. She concludes:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="034151f2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A significant justice element will . . . make promissory estoppel a more meaningful doctrine of contract formation. This will result in a more flexible, egalitarian, and conscionable contracting process. And more generally, this will result in a more inclusive and pluralist contract law. This will benefit first and foremost the underprivileged parties. But this is desirable also to parties generally, including dominant parties. It might be that in the short run, privileged parties profit from denying their promises after benefiting from the promisee’s behavior. However, in the long term, all parties, including privileged parties, will benefit from promoting trust and cooperation between the parties, from protecting the reliance interest, and from including in contract law parties who have been excluded from it in the past.</p>

<p id="0341790e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . Plaintiff Claudia Aceves, a married woman, obtained a loan from Option One Mortgage Corporation (Option One) on April 20, 2006. The loan was evidenced by a note secured by a deed of trust on Aceves’s residence. Aceves borrowed $845,000 at an initial rate of 6.35 percent. After two years, the rate became adjustable. The term of the loan was 30 years. Aceves’s initial monthly payments were $4,857.09.</p>
<p id="0341790f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On March 25, 2008, Option One, the mortgagee, transferred its entire interest under the deed of trust to defendant U.S. Bank, National Association, as <span title="256" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-256">p. 256</span>the “Trustee for the Certificateholders of Asset Backed Securities Corporation Home Equity Loan Trust, Series OOMC 2006-HE5” (U.S. Bank). . . . U.S. Bank, by way of a “Substitution of Trustee,” designated Quality Loan Service Corporation (Quality Loan Service) as the trustee under the deed of trust. . . . </p>
<p id="03417910-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In January 2008, Aceves could no longer afford the monthly payments on the loan. On March 26, 2008, Quality Loan Service recorded a “Notice of Default and Election to Sell Under Deed of Trust.” (See Civ. Code, §2924.) Shortly thereafter, Aceves filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. §§701-784), imposing an automatic stay on the foreclosure proceedings (see 11 U.S.C. §362(a)). Aceves contacted U.S. Bank and was told that, once her loan was out of bankruptcy, the bank “would work with her on a mortgage reinstatement and loan modification.” She was asked to submit documents to U.S. Bank for its consideration.</p>
<p id="03417911-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Aceves intended to convert her chapter 7 bankruptcy case to a chapter 13 case (see 11 U.S.C. §§1301-1330) and to rely on the financial resources of her husband “to save her home” under chapter 13. In general, chapter 7, entitled “Liquidation,” permits a debtor to discharge unpaid debts, but a debtor who discharges an unpaid home loan cannot keep the home; chapter 13, entitled “Adjustment of Debts of an Individual with Regular Income,” allows a homeowner in default to reinstate the original loan payments, pay the arrearages over time, avoid foreclosure, and retain the home. . . . </p>
<p id="03417912-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">U.S. Bank filed a motion in the bankruptcy court to lift the stay so it could proceed with a nonjudicial foreclosure.</p>
<p id="03417913-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On or about November 12, 2008, Aceves’s bankruptcy attorney received a letter from counsel for the company servicing the loan, American Home Mortgage Servicing, Inc. (American Home). The letter requested that Aceves’s attorney agree in writing to allow American Home to contact Aceves directly to “explore Loss Mitigation possibilities.” Thereafter, Aceves contacted American Home’s counsel and was told they could not speak to her before the motion to lift the bankruptcy stay had been granted.</p>
<p id="0341a024-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In reliance on U.S. Bank’s promise to work with her to reinstate and modify the loan, Aceves did not oppose the motion to lift the bankruptcy stay and decided not to seek bankruptcy relief under chapter 13. On December 4, 2008, the bankruptcy court lifted the stay. On December 9, 2008, although neither U.S. Bank nor American Home had contacted Aceves to discuss the reinstatement and modification of the loan, U.S. Bank scheduled Aceves’s home for public auction on January 9, 2009.</p>
<p id="0341a025-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On December 10, 2008, Aceves sent documents to American Home related to reinstating and modifying the loan. On December 23, 2008, American Home informed Aceves that a “negotiator” would contact her on or before January 13, 2009 — four days <i>after</i> the auction of her residence. On December 29, 2008, Aceves received a telephone call from “Samantha,” a negotiator from American Home. Samantha said to forget about any assistance in avoiding foreclosure because the “file” had been “discharged” in bankruptcy. On January 2, 2009, Samantha contacted Aceves again, saying that American Home had mistakenly decided not to offer her any assistance: American Home incorrectly thought <span title="257" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-257">p. 257</span>Aceves’s loan had been <i>discharged</i> in bankruptcy; instead, Aceves had merely <i>filed</i> for bankruptcy. Samantha said that, as a result of American Home’s mistake, it would reconsider a loss mitigation proposal. On January 8, 2009, the day before the auction, Samantha called Aceves’s bankruptcy attorney and stated that the new balance on the loan was $965,926.22; the new monthly payment would be more than $7,200; and a $6,500 deposit was due immediately via Western Union. Samantha refused to put any of those terms in writing. Aceves did not accept the offer.</p>
<p id="0341a026-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On January 9, 2009, Aceves’s home was sold at a trustee’s sale to U.S. Bank. On February 11, 2009, U.S. Bank served Aceves with a three-day notice to vacate the premises and, a month later, filed an unlawful detainer action against her and her husband (<i>U.S. Bank, N.A. v. Aceves</i> (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2009, No. 09H00857)). Apparently, Aceves and her husband vacated the premises during the eviction proceedings.</p>

<p id="0341c743-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“‘[A] promise is an indispensable element of the doctrine of promissory estoppel. The cases are uniform in holding that this doctrine cannot be invoked and must be held inapplicable in the absence of a showing that a promise had been made upon which the complaining party relied to his prejudice. . . .’ . . . The promise must, in addition, be ‘clear and unambiguous in its terms.’ ” (<i>Garcia v. World Savings, FSB</i> (2010) 183 Cal. App. 4th 1031, 1044, 107 Cal. Rptr. 3d 683, citation omitted.) To be enforceable, a promise need only be ‘ “definite enough that a court can determine the scope of the duty[,] and the limits of performance must be sufficiently defined to provide a rational basis for the assessment of damages.” ’ . . . It is only where ‘ “a supposed ‘contract’ does not provide a basis for determining what obligations the parties have agreed to, and hence does not make possible a determination of whether those agreed obligations have been breached, [that] there is no contract.” ’ (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1045, 107 Cal. Rptr. 3d 683, citation omitted.) “[T]hat a promise is conditional does not render it unenforceable or ambiguous.” (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>
<p id="0341c744-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">U.S. Bank agreed to “work with [Aceves] on a mortgage reinstatement and loan modification” if she no longer pursued relief in the bankruptcy court. This is a clear and unambiguous promise. It indicates that U.S. Bank would not foreclose on Aceves’s home without first engaging in negotiations with her to reinstate and modify the loan on mutually agreeable terms.</p>
<p id="0341c745-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">U.S. Bank’s discussion of <i>Laks v. Coast Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn.</i> (1976) 60 Cal. App. 3d 885, 131 Cal. Rptr. 836 misses the mark. There, the plaintiffs applied for a loan and relied on promissory estoppel in arguing that the lender was bound to make the loan. The Court of Appeal affirmed the dismissal of the case on demurrer, explaining that the alleged promise to make a loan was unclear and ambiguous because it did not include all of the essential terms of a loan, including the identity of the borrower and the security for the loan. In contrast, Aceves contends U.S. Bank promised but failed to engage in negotiations toward a solution of her loan problems. Thus, the question here is simply whether U.S. Bank made and kept a promise to <i>negotiate</i> with Aceves, not whether, as in <i>Laks,</i> the bank promised to make a loan or, more precisely, to <span title="259" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-259">p. 259</span>modify a loan. Aceves does not, and could not, assert she relied on the terms of a <i>modified loan agreement</i> in forgoing bankruptcy relief. She acknowledges that the parties never got that far because U.S. Bank broke its promise to negotiate with her in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable modification. While <i>Laks</i> turned on the sufficiency of the terms of a loan, Aceves’s claim rests on whether U.S. Bank engaged in the promised negotiations. The bank either did or did not negotiate.</p>
<p id="0341c746-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Further, U.S. Bank asserts that it <i>offered</i> Aceves a loan modification, referring to the offer it made the day before the auction. That assertion, however, is of no avail. Aceves’s promissory estoppel claim is not based on a promise to make a <i>unilateral offer</i> but on a promise to <i>negotiate</i> in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable loan modification. And, even assuming this case involved a mere promise to make a unilateral offer, we cannot say the bank’s offer satisfied such a promise in light of the offer’s terms and the circumstances under which it was made.</p>

U.S. Bank promised to work with Aceves to reinstate and <i>modify</i> the loan. That would have been more beneficial to Aceves than the relief she could have obtained under chapter 13. The bankruptcy court could have reinstated the loan — permitted Aceves to cure the default, pay the arrearages, and resume regular loan payments — but it could not have <i>modified</i> the terms of the loan, for example, by reducing the amount of the regular monthly payments or extending the life of the loan.

Restricting initial . . . access to Chapter 13 protection will increase foreclosure rates for financially distressed homeowners. Loss of homes hurts not only the individual homeowner but also the family, the neighborhood and the community at large. Preserving access to Chapter 13 will reduce this harm.</p>
<p id="0341ee5f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Chapter 13 bankruptcies do not result in destruction of the interests of traditional mortgage lenders. Under Chapter 13, a debtor cannot discharge a mortgage debt and keep her home. Rather, a Chapter 13 bankruptcy offers the debtor an opportunity to cure a mortgage delinquency over time — in essence it is a statutorily mandated payment plan — but one that requires the debtor to pay precisely the amount she would have to pay to the lender outside of bankruptcy. Under Chapter 13, the plan must provide the amount necessary to cure the mortgage default, which includes the fees and costs allowed by the mortgage agreement and by state law. Mortgage lenders who are secured only by an interest in the debtor’s residence enjoy even greater protection under 11 U.S.C. §1322(b)(2). . . . Known as the ‘anti-modification provision,’ [section] 1322(b)(2) bars a debtor from modifying any rights of such a lender — including the payment schedule provided for under the loan contract. . . . </p>

Mortgage lenders are extraordinarily unwilling to accept repayment schedules outside of bankruptcy. . . . There is no history to support any claim that lenders will accommodate the need for extended workouts without the pressure of bankruptcy as an option for consumer debtors. Reducing the availability of [C]hapter 13 protection to mortgage debtors is most likely to result in higher foreclosure rates, not in greater flexibility by lenders.” (DeJarnatt, <i>Once Is Not Enough: Preserving Consumers’ Rights To Bankruptcy Protection</i> (Spring 1999) Ind.

Aceves </i>is one of millions of foreclosure cases that have arisen because of the economic crisis that began in 2008. Another example is Dixon v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 798 F. Supp. 2d 336 (D. Mass. 2011), which allegedly involved conduct perhaps even more egregious than that of the bank in <i>Aceves.</i> In <i>Dixon,</i> the court found that the plaintiff mortgagors stated a cause of action under the doctrine of promissory estoppel sufficient to enjoin the defendant bank from proceeding with a foreclosure sale. When the Dixons had sought to renegotiate their loan, the defendant bank told them they would have to stop making payments on their existing loan, which was current, and provide financial information before it would engage in negotiations. The Dixons did so, but the bank proceeded to initiate foreclosure proceedings anyway. Some courts in cases with similar facts have permitted the plaintiffs to proceed with their claims of promissory estoppel. Other courts have been less receptive. E.g., Rosen v. Bank of Amer., N.A., 2012 WL 6722060 (Cal. Ct. App.) (claim dismissed; <i>Aceves</i> distinguished); MacKenzie v. Flagstar Bank, FSB, 738 F.3d 486 (1st Cir. 2013) (pleadings did not adequately allege reliance; <i>Dixon</i> distinguished). The economic crisis has also raised a number of other difficult issues dealing with the enforceability of contracts when dramatically changed circumstances occur. We explore these topics in more detail in Chapter 8. See Nathan M. Crystal &amp; Francesca Giannoni-Crystal, Contract Enforceability During Economic Crisis: Legal Principles and Drafting Solutions, <i>Global Jurist</i>: Vol. 10: Iss. 3 (Advances), Article 3 (2010).</p></li>

In many situations, that degree of success on the plaintiff’s part will persuade the defendant to settle the case rather than carry on with (and pay attorney fees for) further litigation. This may not be the case, however, and the defendant may ultimately prevail in a trial on the merits. This apparently happened in Aceves’s case. Aceves v. U.S. Bank, N.A., 2015 WL 6515185 (Cal. Ct.

<li class=""><p id="03423c92-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Promissory fraud.</i> The <i>Aceves</i> court also stated that the plaintiff’s allegations against the bank were legally sufficient to establish fraud. While a breach of promise may be actionable under either a contract or promissory estoppel theory, it is not normally actionable in tort as fraud because a claim of fraud requires a misrepresentation of a present fact rather than a promise to do something in the future. In some cases, however, a breach of promise may be fraudulent — if the promisor did not intend to perform the promise at the time the promise was made. In such a case, the promisor has misrepresented a present fact, namely the promisor’s intention to perform the promise. Restatement (Second) of Torts §530 provides as follows: “A representation of the maker’s own intention to do or not to do a particular thing is fraudulent if he does not have that intention.” We will encounter more examples of promissory fraud in later chapters.</p></li>

As we noted earlier, the revised §90 has an additional subsection providing for enforcement of charitable subscriptions even without a showing of detrimental reliance. In addition, the drafters revised the text of §90 by adding a reference to the possibility of third-party reliance, by indicating that the remedy to be awarded “may be limited as justice requires,” and by deleting the requirement that in order for reliance to be protectable it must be “definite and substantial.” Various aspects of the Restatement (Second) approach to promissory estoppel are considered in Charles L. Knapp, Reliance in the Revised <i>Restatement:</i> The Proliferation of Promissory Estoppel, 81 Colum. L. Rev. 52 (1981).</p></li>

Supp. 2d 236 (S.D.N.Y. 2002), plaintiff pharmaceutical manufacturer asserted a variety of claims against defendant competitor and raw material supplier, including antitrust, breach of contract, and tort. Because the plaintiff was an American corporation and the defendant Canadian, the CISG governed their contractual relations, and preempted the plaintiff’s state law contract claims. The plaintiff’s tort claims, on the other hand, were clearly not preempted. The plaintiff also asserted a promissory estoppel claim, however, and the court had to decide whether that was preempted along with the contract claim. Noting that the CISG in Article <span title="264" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-264">p. 264</span>16(2)(b) recognizes reliance, the court indicated that perhaps a reliance claim intended to establish a “firm offer” would be preempted by that provision. Here, however, the plaintiff’s claim of promissory estoppel was a more general one asserted to make a promise binding, and the court held such a claim not to be preempted by the CISG.

<li class=""><p id="03423c97-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Bankruptcy and contracts</i>. Article I, §8, clause 4 of the U.S. Constitution authorizes Congress to enact “uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States.” Bankruptcy law is based on the policy that debtors sometimes need a fresh start to overcome a burden of debt that the debtor would otherwise be unable to pay. Without bankruptcy relief, those debtors would be unable to function as part of the economic life of the society. At the same time, the bankruptcy process can be misused by debtors, and the law contains a number of provisions to protect creditors from bad faith use of the bankruptcy process. Of course, as <i>Aceves</i> points out, a creditor may feel that the debtor is abusing the bankruptcy process, but if the debtor is asserting a right granted by law, that is not abuse.</p>
<p id="034263a8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The basic form of bankruptcy is a liquidation of the debtor’s assets under chapter 7 of the United States Code, 11 U.S.C. ch. 7. In a liquidation, a court-appointed trustee assembles and sells the assets of the debtor to pay the claims of the creditors. In a chapter 7 bankruptcy, the debtor will not keep any assets, except those that are exempt from bankruptcy. If a debtor wishes to maintain its assets, it must seek court approval of some form of reorganization. For individuals with regular income, chapter 13 is a vehicle for such a reorganization. In a chapter 13 case, a bankrupt individual may be able to avoid foreclosure. Thus, it would have been to defendant’s advantage to deter Aceves’s shift from a chapter 7 liquidation to a chapter 13 reorganization.</p></li>

<p id="034263ab-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The remarkable growth and expansion of promissory estoppel since its incorporation in the first Restatement led Professor Knapp to suggest in 1981 that promissory estoppel had become “perhaps the most radical and expansive development of this century in the law of promissory liability.” Charles L. Knapp, Reliance in the Revised <i>Restatement:</i> The Proliferation of Promissory Estoppel, 81 Colum. L. Rev. 52, 53 (1981). In a comprehensive review of the status of promissory estoppel almost two decades later, however, Professor Knapp suggested that a “reassessment appears to be in order,” and that “1980 may have been the high-water mark for promissory estoppel.” Charles L. Knapp, Rescuing Reliance: The Perils of Promissory Estoppel, 49 Hastings L.J. 1191, 1192 (1998). See also E. Allan Farnsworth, Developments in Contract Law <span title="265" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-265">p. 265</span>During the 1980’s: The Top Ten, 41 Case W.

<p id="034263ac-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One factor contributing to this more cautious appraisal of promissory estoppel was scholarly commentary critical of the doctrine. Since the early 1980s many scholars have questioned the intellectual foundations of promissory estoppel. Some writers have been directly critical of the doctrine. E.g., Jay M. Feinman, The Last Promissory Estoppel Article, 61 Fordham L. Rev. 303 (1992). In addition to outright criticism, a number of scholars have argued for “assent-based” theories of liability, less focused on reliance. E.g., Daniel A. Farber &amp; John H. Matheson, Beyond Promissory Estoppel: Contract Law and the “Invisible Handshake,” 52 U. Chi. L. Rev. 903, 945 (1985); Edward Yorio &amp; Steve Thel, The Promissory Basis of Section 90, 101 Yale L.J. 111 (1991).</p>
<p id="034263ad-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In assessing the status and future of promissory estoppel, however, scholarly commentary is less important than the extent to which the doctrine has been applied by courts. Virtually every jurisdiction has accepted the doctrine, see Eric Mills Holmes, Restatement of Promissory Estoppel, 32 Willamette L. Rev. 263 (1996), but the evidence is conflicting about the extent to which courts have used the doctrine favorably. See, e.g., Robert A. Hillman, Questioning the “New Consensus” on Promissory Estoppel: An Empirical and Theoretical Study, 98 Colum. L. Rev. 580, 589 (1998) (generally unsuccessful); but see Juliet P. Kostritsky, The Rise and Fall of Promissory Estoppel or Is Promissory Estoppel Really as Unsuccessful as Scholars Say It Is: A New Look at the Data, 37 Wake Forest L. Rev. 531 (2002); Marco J.

<p id="034263b0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having surveyed in the preceding section some instances of promise-enforcement despite the absence of consideration for the promise, we turn now to an issue that has proven to be problematic to the common law of contract for over a century: The principle of free revocability of an offer. What, if anything, can limit the power that an offeror possesses under traditional rules of contract law to freely revoke her offer at any time, without any requirement that she have a good reason for doing so — and even if she has in fact promised to keep her offer open?</p>
<p id="034263b1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Chapter 2, we saw that the traditional method of mutual assent was through the process of offer and acceptance. We also encountered the <span title="266" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-266">p. 266</span>fundamental Anglo-American common law rule that an offer is revocable unless and until it is accepted by the offeree, even if the offer itself expressly states that it cannot and will not be revoked. (Recall the <i>Normile</i> case.) This principle of free revocability, however logical it may have seemed as part of the structure of classical contract law, is certainly no manifestation of a necessary “natural law” of contract. For example, Article 16 of the CISG provides as follows:</p>

They turned out to be wrong, however, in part because the court in that case found that the seller had never expressly promised not to revoke her counter-offer to them. In the following case, the would-be buyer claims that the potential seller did in fact promise not to revoke his offer, and that he (the buyer) therefore retained the power to accept it, even in the teeth of the seller’s attempt at revocation.</p>

<p id="03428ad0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Wade Berryman, a landowner, filed this declaratory judgment action to have an option contract declared null and void. Norbert H. Kmoch, the optionee, answered and counter-claimed seeking damages for Berryman’s failure to convey the land. After depositions were taken and discovery proceedings completed both parties filed separate motions for summary judgment. The trial court entered a summary judgment for plaintiff and held the option was granted without consideration, was in effect an offer to sell subject to withdrawal at any time prior to acceptance and was withdrawn in July, 1973, prior to its being exercised by Kmoch. Kmoch has appealed.</p>
<p id="03428ad1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="267" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-267">p. 267</span>The option agreement dated June 19, 1973, was signed by Wade Berryman of Meade, Kansas, and was addressed to Mr. Norbert H. Kmoch, 1155 Ash Street, Denver, Colorado. The granting clause provided:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="0342b1e2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For $10.00 and other valuable consideration, I hereby grant unto you or your assigns an option for 120 days after date to purchase the following described real estate: [Then followed the legal description of 960 acres of land located in Stanton County, Kansas.]</p>
</div>
<p id="0342b1e3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The balance of the option agreement sets forth the terms of purchase including the price for the land and the growing crops, the water rights and irrigation equipment included in the sale, the time possession was to be delivered to the purchaser, and other provisions not pertinent to the questions presented here on appeal.</p>
<p id="0342b1e4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before examining the questions raised on appeal it will be helpful to set forth a few of the facts admitted and on which there is no dispute. Berryman was the owner of the land. Kmoch was a Colorado real estate broker. A third person, Samuel M. Goertz, was a Nebraska agricultural consultant. Goertz learned that Berryman was interested in selling the land and talked to Berryman about obtaining an option on the land for Kmoch. Goertz talked to Kmoch and Kmoch prepared the option contract dated June 19, 1973. Goertz and Kmoch flew to Johnson, Kansas, where a meeting with Berryman had been arranged. At this meeting the option agreement was signed by Berryman. Although the agreement recited the option was granted “for $10.00 and other valuable consideration,” the $10.00 was not paid.</p>
<p id="0342b1e5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The next conversation between Berryman and Kmoch occurred during the latter part of July, 1973. Berryman called Kmoch by telephone and asked to be released from the option agreement. Nothing definite was worked out between them. Berryman sold the land to another person. In August, Kmoch decided to exercise the option and went to the Federal Land Bank representative in Garden City, Kansas, to make arrangements to purchase the land. He was then informed by the bank representative that the land had been sold by Berryman. Kmoch then recorded the option agreement in Stanton County. After a telephone conversation with Berryman was unproductive, Kmoch sent a letter to Berryman in October, 1973, attempting to exercise his option on the land. Berryman responded by bringing the present action to have the option declared null and void.</p>
<p id="0342b1e6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant, Kmoch, acknowledges that the $10.00 cash consideration recited in the option agreement was never paid. However, he points out the agreement included a provision for “other valuable consideration” and that he should have been permitted to introduce evidence to establish time spent and expenses incurred in an effort to interest others in joining him in acquiring the land. He points to the deposition testimony of Goertz and another man by the name of Robert Harris, who had examined the land under option. Their services were sought by Kmoch to obtain a farm report on the land which might interest other investors. In addition appellant argues that promissory estoppel should have been applied by the trial court as a substitute for consideration.</p>
<p id="0342b1e7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="268" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-268">p. 268</span>An option contract to purchase land to be binding must be supported by consideration the same as any other contract. If no consideration was given in the present case the trial court correctly found there was no more than a continuing offer to sell. An option contract which is not supported by consideration is a mere offer to sell which may be withdrawn at any time prior to acceptance. . . . </p>
<p id="0342b1e8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We turn next to appellant’s contention that the option contract should have been enforceable under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. This doctrine has been discussed in Marker v. Preferred Fire Ins. Co., 211 Kan. 427, 506 P.2d 1163. . . . In <i>Marker</i> it is held:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="0342b1e9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In order for the doctrine of promissory estoppel to be invoked the evidence must show that the promise was made under circumstances where the promisor intended and reasonably expected that the promise would be relied upon by the promisee and further that the promisee acted reasonably in relying upon the promise. Furthermore promissory estoppel should be applied only if a refusal to enforce it would be virtually to sanction the perpetration of fraud or would result in other injustice.</p>
</div>
<p id="0342b1ea-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">211 Kan. 427, Syl. 4, 506 P.2d 1163. . . . </p>
<p id="0342b1eb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In order for the doctrine of promissory estoppel to be invoked as a substitute for consideration the evidence must show (1) the promise was made under such circumstances that the promisor reasonably expected the promisee to act in reliance on the promise, (2) the promisee acted as could reasonably be expected in relying on the promise, and (3) a refusal by the court to enforce the promise must be virtually to sanction the perpetration of fraud or must result in other injustice.</p>
<p id="0342b1ec-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The requirements are not met here. This was an option contract promising to sell the land to appellant. It was not a contract listing the real estate with Kmoch for sale to others. Kmoch was familiar with real estate contracts and personally drew up the present option. He knew no consideration was paid for the same and that it had the effect of a continuing offer subject to withdrawal at any time before acceptance. The acts which appellant urges as consideration conferred no special benefit on the promisor or on his land. The evidence which appellant desires to introduce in support of promissory estoppel does not relate to acts which could reasonably be expected as a result of extending the option promise. It relates to time, effort, and expense incurred in an attempt to interest other investors in this particular land. The appellant chose the form of the contract. It was not a contract listing the land for sale with one entrusted with duties and obligations to produce a buyer. The appellant was not obligated to do anything and no basis for promissory estoppel could be shown by the evidence proposed.</p>
<p id="0342b1ed-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An option contract can be made binding and irrevocable by subsequent action in reliance upon it even though such action is neither requested nor given in exchange for the option promise. An option promise is no different from other promises in this respect but cases are rare in which an option holder will be reasonably induced to change his position in reliance upon an option <span title="269" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-269">p. 269</span>promise that is neither under seal nor made binding by a consideration, or in which the option promisor has reason to expect such change of position. (1A Corbin on Contracts, §263, pp. 502-504.)</p>
<p id="0342b1ee-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When an option is conditioned upon a performance of certain acts, the performance of the acts may constitute a consideration to uphold a contract for option; but there is no such condition imposed if the acts were not intended to benefit nor were they incurred on behalf of the optionor.</p>
<p id="0342b1ef-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The appellant argues that to assume Berryman gave the option without expecting something from him in return is to avoid the realities of the business world and that consideration was encompassed by a promise for a promise. The difficulty with that argument is apparent. Appellant did not promise to purchase the land. He was required to do nothing and any assertion that Berryman expected him to raise and pay money for the land as consideration for the option confuses motive with consideration.</p>

<p id="0342d904-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant here confuses Berryman’s possible motives — to sell the land — with consideration given. The fact Berryman expected appellant to expend time and money to find a buyer is really irrelevant because he was not bound to do so. He made no promise legally enforceable by Berryman to that effect. To be sufficient consideration, a promise must impose a legal obligation on the promisor. (17 Am. Jur. 2d, Contracts, §105, pp. 450-451.) As stated in 1A Corbin on Contracts, §263, p. 505: “. . . So, if the only consideration is an illusory promise, there is no contract and no binding option, although there may still be an operative offer and a power of acceptance.”</p>

<p id="0342d906-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two cases relied on by appellant to support his position are Talbott v. Nibert, supra, and Steel v. Eagle, 207 Kan. 146, 483 P.2d 1063. They are not persuasive and are readily distinguishable on the facts.</p>
<p id="0342d907-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Talbott</i> the plaintiff had acquired an option to purchase majority stock interests in an oil drilling company from another stockholder. In reliance on the option plaintiff personally obtained valuable drilling contracts for the company, paid off a $23,000.00 mortgage on a drilling rig and pulled the company out of financial straits. During this time the stock had increased in value from <span title="270" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-270">p. 270</span>$90.00 per share to $250.00 per share, largely as a result of plaintiff’s efforts. It was plaintiff’s intention to acquire a controlling interest in the company by exercising the option, this the optionor knew. The court found the option-offer was duly accepted and the purchase price was tendered before revocation. In our present case the option-offer was withdrawn before acceptance. We will discuss the withdrawal of the option later in this opinion.</p>
<p id="0342d908-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Steel</i> the option was for the sale of a milling company. The option agreement stated that the optionee promised to place $5,000.00 with an escrow agent no later than a specified time in the future and that if the option was not exercised according to its terms the $5,000.00 would be forfeited. It was held that the option was adequately supported by consideration, a promise for a promise. The optionor granted the option and promised to transfer title to the company. The optionee promised to pay $5,000.00 as evidence of good faith, said sum to be forfeited in event the option was not exercised. This is not the case here. Our present option recited a completed payment of $10.00, even though it had not been paid. Payment during the option period was not contemplated by either party and the tender of the $10.00 was not made by defendant-appellant in his counter-claim when that pleading was filed.</p>
<p id="0342d909-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now we turn to the question of revocation or withdrawal of the option-promise before acceptance.</p>

<li class=""><p id="03430021-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Option as consideration-supported contract.</i> In Chapter 2, we encountered the fundamental common law rule that an offer generally is freely revocable unless and until it is accepted by the offeree, even if the offer itself expressly states that it will not be revoked. See Restatement (Second) §42, Comment <i>a</i>. <span title="271" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-271">p. 271</span>As the court in <i>Berryman</i> recognizes, however, the offeror’s power of revocation may be bargained away in exchange for return consideration. Such a contract restricting the power to revoke an offer is usually referred to as an “option contract.” But like contracts generally, it must be made for consideration to be enforceable. See, e.g., Polk v. BHRGU Avon Properties, LLC, 946 So. 2d 1120 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2006) (purported option contract without consideration is merely continuing offer, may be revoked any time before acceptance, and will be terminated by the offeree’s rejection or counter-offer). In contrast with <i>Normile</i> and <i>Berryman</i>, examples of enforceable option contracts are plentiful. See, e.g., Harley v. Indian Spring Land Co., 3 A.3d 992 (Conn. App. Ct. 2010) (payment of refundable $10,000 “good faith deposit” was consideration to bind option contract to purchase land for $1.2 million; detriment suffered by losing use of deposited money was sufficient consideration); Terraces of Sunset Park, LLC v. Chamberlin, 929 N.E.2d 1161 (Ill. App. Ct. 2010) (payment of nonrefundable $100,000 fee provided consideration for two-year option to purchase land for price of $1,750,000). To hold seller Berryman to a contract with plaintiff Kmoch, the court would — among other things — have to find that the seller had made a promise not to revoke his offer for the stated time period. Does the court so interpret the writing signed by <i>Berryman</i>? Would you?</p>
<p id="03430022-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Option contracts serve a useful purpose in commercial relations, by permitting one who is considering a contractual transaction to delay committing herself to the contemplated exchange without fearing that such delay will cost her the ability to enter into that contract, should she eventually decide to accept it. The optionee thus has some time to consider the deal before committing to the actual contract to purchase, giving her a chance perhaps to investigate its feasibility or desirability or to make related arrangements. On the other hand, the optionee is also free simply to allow the option to lapse and not exercise the right to enter the principal contract. In that case the consideration paid for the option is presumably retained by the offeror, unless the parties have agreed otherwise. There are a number of issues that can arise in connection with option contracts, as discussed below.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03430023-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Nominal consideration</i>. Apart from the possible payment of substantial consideration, as illustrated in the cases noted above, option contracts will often recite the payment of what is traditionally called “nominal” consideration, such as $10, $5, or perhaps even as little as $1. The question thus arises whether the payment of such nominal consideration will make the option contract enforceable, since it appears not to have been the actual inducement for granting the option. (Do you think it was the actual inducement in <i>Berryman</i>?) The cases generally appear to hold that even a very small amount of money can serve as effective consideration to make an option contract irrevocable. See Board of Control of Eastern Michigan Univ. v. Burgess, 206 N.W.2d 256 (Mich. Ct. App. 1973) ($1, if paid or at least tendered, could be sufficient consideration for 60-day option to buy house for $14,000); Keaster v. Bozik, 623 P.2d 1376 (Mont. 1981) ($5 could be sufficient consideration to bind one-year option to purchase land for $200,000). Some courts have even found consideration in an implied promise on the part of the option holder to pay the nominal <span title="272" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-272">p. 272</span>consideration at some later time. See, e.g., Smith v. Wheeler, 210 S.E.2d 702 (Ga. 1974) (recital of consideration “gives rise to an implied promise to pay which can be enforced by the other party”). Note that this minimalist approach to consideration appears to some extent to be inconsistent with the Restatement (Second) position that “nominal consideration” generally is not effective. See Restatement (Second) §79, Comment <i>d</i> (“sham or ‘nominal’ consideration does not satisfy the requirement of §71”).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03430024-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Services as consideration.</i> Consistent with the definition of consideration in Restatement (Second) §71, the offeree in an option contract may give services or some other form of consideration instead of the payment of money. The services could be acts such as conducting engineering studies of the land, engaging in efforts to obtain a loan to finance the purchase, or searching for investors, if that performance was bargained for as the price of the option. See, e.g., Mack v. Coker, 523 P.2d 1342 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1974) (purchaser promised to make efforts to obtain a loan); In re Estate of Jorstad, 447 N.W.2d 283 (N. D. 1989) (son’s promise to stay and work on parents’ farm was sufficient consideration to enforce their promise to sell farm to him for $70,000). Does the <i>Berryman</i> court convincingly reject the plaintiff’s argument that he had performed services sufficient to serve as consideration for the defendant’s promise to keep his offer open?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03430025-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Should use of a “formality” be effective to create an option contract?</i> In Restatement (Second) §87(1)(a), the drafters suggested an additional rule for option contracts, making an option enforceable if it is stated in a writing signed by the offeror which “recites a purported consideration” for its making and “proposes an exchange on fair terms within a reasonable time.” If the payment of a sum as small as $5 or $10 can be enough consideration to bind an option contract, should such a contract be enforced even if the recited payment was not actually made, but only “purported”? Although traditionally most courts would (like the <i>Berryman</i> court) require that the nominal consideration actually be paid, the Restatement (Second) §87(1)(a) adopts a different approach. Comment <i>c</i> to §87 frankly refers to this rule as one that calls for enforcement on the basis of a “false recital of nominal consideration.” The comment explains that the rule is based on form rather than on the implication of a promise: The signed writing has “vital significance as a formality,” and therefore its recital of consideration should not be open to invalidation by “oral testimony which is easily fabricated.” After an extensive review of the issue, the Texas Supreme Court in 1464-Eight, Ltd. v. Joppich, 154 S.W.3d 101 (Tex. 2004), adopted the position of Restatement (Second) §87(1)(a); the option contract was in a writing signed by the respondent, acknowledged the receipt of ten dollars as consideration, and proposed the sale of land on fair terms within a reasonable time. The court recognized, however, that its new rule was the minority position. See also Knott v. Racicot, 812 N.E.2d 1207 (Mass. 2004) (adopting the Restatement (Second) §87(1)(a) approach). No one involved in the <i>Berryman</i> case appears to have been aware of this possibility. If the plaintiff in <i>Berryman</i> had persuaded the court to adopt in general the rule of Restatement (Second) §87(1)(a), would it necessarily follow that the writing <span title="273" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-273">p. 273</span>in that case would have satisfied that rule, making the seller’s offer irrevocable until its stated deadline?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03430026-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Other formality rules as grounds for enforcing an option contract</i>. Recall that the plaintiffs in <i>Normile</i> argued (unsuccessfully) that an option contract made under seal would be enforceable on that basis alone. While the seal has lost most of its vitality, the <i>Normile</i> opinion correctly indicates that the area of option contracts is one where a seal may still have legal significance. Cf. Knott v. Racicot, 812 N.E.2d 1207 (Mass. 2004) (discussing the history and declining importance of the seal; abolishing the common law rule that option contracts under seal import consideration). Note that the approach stated in Restatement (Second) §87(1)(a) is a modern formality rule somewhat akin to having a contract under seal. Moreover, UCC §2-205, the Code’s “firm offer” rule, adopts a formality standard that may render an option contract for the sale of goods enforceable without consideration. That rule is discussed in the next section of this chapter.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03432737-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Application of the “mailbox rule” to option contracts.</i> Should an option contract be an exception to the deposited-acceptance rule, so that even if use of the mail is contemplated, an acceptance to be effective must be <i>received</i> by the offeror within the time limit specified? The Restatement (Second) takes this position in §63(b); Comment <i>f</i> explains “the usual understanding is that the notification that the option has been exercised must be received by the offeror” before the stated time limit. Not all courts agree, however. In Worms v. Burgess, 620 P.2d 455 (Okla. Ct. App. 1980), the court rejected the Restatement position, on the ground that the “mailbox rule” is so widely known that the parties to an option contract should be presumed to have contracted with reference to that rule unless they have expressly provided otherwise. Accord Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts v. Grant, 590 A.2d 9 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1991).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03432738-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Effectiveness of revocation.</i> At the risk of stating the obvious, it should be recalled here that even if the offer is held to have been revocable, acceptance of that offer will ordinarily still bind the offeror to a contract unless a valid revocation was received by the offeree before acceptance. See, e.g., I. R. Kirk Farms, Inc. v. Pointer, 897 S.W.2d 183 (Mo. Ct. App. 1995) (even if option is unenforceable due to lack of consideration, offer reflected in option may be accepted prior to revocation). In <i>Berryman,</i> the court found that the offer was revocable; did the offeror effectively revoke it in his phone conversation with Kmoch in late July? If not, then it was apparently terminated in August, when he learned from a bank representative that the seller had sold the land to someone else. This rule of indirect communication of revocation, currently expressed in Restatement (Second) §43, was established by the English case of Dickinson v. Dodds, 2 Ch. Div. 463 (1876). You may recall that we first encountered the <i>Dickinson</i> rule in Normile v. Miller early in Chapter 2, when the broker told Normile that “you snooze, you lose.”</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03432739-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Termination of an option.</i> As reflected in the Notes following the <i>Normile</i> case, Restatement (Second) §36 states a variety of ways in which an ordinary <span title="274" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-274">p. 274</span>offer may normally be terminated: rejection, counter-offer, revocation, death of the offeror or offeree, etc. An option contract, however, is in fact a “contract” itself, not a mere offer subject to the rules stated in §36. Restatement (Second) §37 provides that “the power of acceptance under an option contract is <i>not</i> terminated by rejection or counter-offer, by revocation, or by death or incapacity of the offeror . . . .” (Emphasis added.) To discharge an option, the parties would need to make another binding agreement, ostensibly with new consideration on both sides, or establish other grounds for termination of the power of acceptance, pursuant to doctrines that will be discussed later in these materials.</p></li>

<p id="0343273c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If an offeree wants to be certain that an offer will remain open for her to accept while she explores the desirability of the deal it proposes, she might enter into an option contract with the offeror, and provide some consideration (typically money) for his promise to keep the offer open. But in many cases, for a variety of reasons, this does not happen. Suppose the offeree nevertheless does delay accepting, in the belief that the offeror will not revoke his offer, and in the meantime takes various actions in reliance on her expectation that the offer will remain open. If the offeror does attempt to revoke before the offeree has actually made an acceptance, can the offeree claim that her reliance provides a sufficient reason to hold the offeror to his offer? In the <i>Berryman</i> case, the court briefly considers that possibility, but rejects it. The cases that follow demonstrate a variety of judicial responses to this same question.</p>

<p id="03434e52-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">L. <span class="epub-small-caps">Hand</span>, Circuit Judge.</p>
<p id="03434e53-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff sued the defendant for breach of a contract to deliver linoleum under a contract of sale; the defendant denied the making of the contract; the parties tried the case to the judge under a written stipulation and he directed judgment for the defendant. The facts as found, bearing on the making of the contract, the only issue necessary to discuss, were as follows: The defendant, a New York merchant, knew that the Department of Highways in Pennsylvania had asked for bids for the construction of a public building. It sent an employee to the office of a contractor in Philadelphia, who had possession of the specifications, and the employee there computed the amount of the linoleum which would be required on the job, underestimating the total yardage by about one-half the proper amount. In ignorance of this mistake, on December twenty-fourth the defendant sent to some twenty or thirty contractors, likely to bid on the job, an offer to supply all the linoleum required by the specifications at two different lump sums, depending upon the quality used. These offers <span title="275" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-275">p. 275</span>concluded as follows: “If successful in being awarded this contract, it will be absolutely guaranteed, . . . and . . . we are offering these prices for reasonable” (sic), “prompt acceptance after the general contract has been awarded.” The plaintiff, a contractor in Washington, got one of these on the twenty-eighth, and on the same day the defendant learned its mistake and telegraphed all the contractors to whom it had sent the offer, that it withdrew it and would substitute a new one at about double the amount of the old. This withdrawal reached the plaintiff at Washington on the afternoon of the same day, but not until after it had put in a bid at Harrisburg at a lump sum, based as to linoleum upon the prices quoted by the defendant. The public authorities accepted the plaintiff’s bid on December thirtieth, the defendant having meanwhile written a letter of confirmation of its withdrawal, received on the thirty-first. The plaintiff formally accepted the offer on January second, and, as the defendant persisted in declining to recognize the existence of a contract, sued it for damages on a breach.</p>
<p id="03434e54-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unless there are circumstances to take it out of the ordinary doctrine, since the offer was withdrawn before it was accepted, the acceptance was too late. Restatement of Contracts, §35. To meet this the plaintiff argues as follows: It was a reasonable implication from the defendant’s offer that it should be irrevocable in case the plaintiff acted upon it, that is to say, used the prices quoted in making its bid, thus putting itself in a position from which it could not withdraw without great loss. While it might have withdrawn its bid after receiving the revocation, the time had passed to submit another, and as the item of linoleum was a very trifling part of the cost of the whole building, it would have been an unreasonable hardship to expect it to lose the contract on that account, and probably forfeit its deposit. While it is true that the plaintiff might in advance have secured a contract conditional upon the success of its bid, this was not what the defendant suggested. It understood that the contractors would use its offer in their bids, and would thus in fact commit themselves to supplying the linoleum at the proposed prices. The inevitable implication from all this was that when the contractors acted upon it, they accepted the offer and promised to pay for the linoleum, in case their bid were accepted.</p>
<p id="03434e55-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It was of course possible for the parties to make such a contract, and the question is merely as to what they meant; that is, what is to be imputed to the words they used. Whatever plausibility there is in the argument, is in the fact that the defendant must have known the predicament in which the contractors would be put if it withdrew its offer after the bids went in. However, it seems entirely clear that the contractors did not suppose that they accepted the offer merely by putting in their bids. If, for example, the successful one had repudiated the contract with the public authorities after it had been awarded to him, certainly the defendant could not have sued him for a breach. If he had become bankrupt, the defendant could not prove against his estate. It seems plain therefore that there was no contract between them. And if there be any doubt as to this, the language of the offer sets it at rest. The phrase, “if successful in being awarded this contract,” is scarcely met by the mere use of <span title="276" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-276">p. 276</span>the prices in the bids. Surely such a use was not an “award” of the contract to the defendant. Again, the phrase, “we are offering these prices for . . . prompt acceptance after the general contract has been awarded,” looks to the usual communication of an acceptance, and precludes the idea that the use of the offer in the bidding shall be the equivalent. It may indeed be argued that this last language contemplated no more than an early notice that the offer had been accepted, the actual acceptance being the bid, but that would wrench its natural meaning too far, especially in the light of the preceding phrase. The contractors had a ready escape from their difficulty by insisting upon a contract before they used the figures; and in commercial transactions it does not in the end promote justice to seek strained interpretations in aid of those who do not protect themselves.</p>
<p id="03434e56-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the plaintiff says that even though no bilateral contract was made, the defendant should be held under the doctrine of “promissory estoppel.” This is to be chiefly found in those cases where persons subscribe to a venture, usually charitable, and are held to their promises after it has been completed. It has been applied much more broadly, however, and has now been generalized in section 90, of the Restatement of Contracts. We may arguendo accept it as it there reads, for it does not apply to the case at bar. Offers are ordinarily made in exchange for a consideration, either a counter-promise or some other act which the promisor wishes to secure. In such cases they propose bargains; they presuppose that each promise or performance is an inducement to the other. Wisconsin, etc., Ry. v. Powers, 191 U.S. 379, 386, 387, 24 S. Ct. 107, 48 L. Ed. 229; Banning Co. v. California, 240 U.S. 142, 152, 153, 36 S. Ct. 338, 60 L. Ed. 569. But a man may make a promise without expecting an equivalent; a donative promise, conditional or absolute. The common law provided for such by sealed instruments, and it is unfortunate that these are no longer generally available. The doctrine of “promissory estoppel” is to avoid the harsh results of allowing the promisor in such a case to repudiate, when the promisee has acted in reliance upon the promise. Siegel v. Spear &amp; Co., 234 N.Y. 479, 138 N.E. 414, 26 A.L.R. 1205. Cf. Allegheny College v. National Bank, 246 N.Y. 369, 159 N.E. 173, 57 L.R.A. 980. But an offer for an exchange is not meant to become a promise until a consideration has been received, either a counter-promise or whatever else is stipulated. To extend it would be to hold the offeror regardless of the stipulated condition of his offer. In the case at bar the defendant offered to deliver the linoleum in exchange for the plaintiff’s acceptance, not for its bid, which was a matter of indifference to it. That offer could become a promise to deliver only when the equivalent was received; that is, when the plaintiff promised to take and pay for it. There is no room in such a situation for the doctrine of “promissory estoppel.”</p>
<p id="03434e57-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor can the offer be regarded as of an option, giving the plaintiff the right seasonably to accept the linoleum at the quoted prices if its bid was accepted, but not binding it to take and pay, if it could get a better bargain elsewhere. There is not the least reason to suppose that the defendant meant to subject itself to such a one-sided obligation. True, if so construed, the doctrine of “promissory estoppel” might apply, the plaintiff having acted in <span title="277" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-277">p. 277</span>reliance upon it, though, so far as we have found, the decisions are otherwise. Ganss v. Guffey Petroleum Co., 125 App. Div. 760, 110 N.Y.S. 176; Comstock v. North, 88 Miss. 754, 41 So. 374. As to that, however, we need not declare ourselves.</p>

<p id="03437574-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant appeals from a judgment for plaintiff in an action to recover damages caused by defendant’s refusal to perform certain paving work according to a bid it submitted to plaintiff.</p>
<p id="03437575-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On July 28, 1955, plaintiff, a licensed general contractor, was preparing a bid on the “Monte Vista School Job” in the Lancaster school district. Bids had to be submitted before 8:00 <span class="epub-small-caps">p.m</span>. Plaintiff testified that it was customary in that area for general contractors to receive the bids of subcontractors by telephone on the day set for bidding and to rely on them in computing their own bids. Thus <span title="278" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-278">p. 278</span>on that day plaintiff’s secretary, Mrs. Johnson, received by telephone between fifty and seventy-five subcontractors’ bids for various parts of the school job. As each bid came in, she wrote it on a special form, which she brought into plaintiff’s office. He then posted it on a master cost sheet setting forth the names and bids of all subcontractors. His own bid had to include the names of subcontractors who were to perform one-half of one per cent or more of the construction work, and he had also to provide a bidder’s bond of ten per cent of his total bid of $317,385 as a guarantee that he would enter the contract if awarded the work.</p>
<p id="03437576-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Later in the afternoon, Mrs. Johnson had a telephone conversation with Kenneth R. Hoon, an estimator for defendant. He gave his name and telephone number and stated that he was bidding for defendant for the paving work at the Monte Vista School according to plans and specifications and that his bid was $7,131.60. At Mrs. Johnson’s request he repeated his bid. Plaintiff listened to the bid over an extension telephone in his office and posted it on the master sheet after receiving the bid form from Mrs. Johnson. Defendant’s was the lowest bid for the paving. Plaintiff computed his own bid accordingly and submitted it with the name of defendant as the subcontractor for the paving. When the bids were opened on July 28th, plaintiff’s proved to be the lowest, and he was awarded the contract.</p>
<p id="03437577-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On his way to Los Angeles the next morning plaintiff stopped at defendant’s office. The first person he met was defendant’s construction engineer, Mr. Oppenheimer. Plaintiff testified: “I introduced myself and he immediately told me that they had made a mistake in their bid to me the night before, they couldn’t do it for the price they had bid, and I told him I would expect him to carry through with their original bid because I had used it in compiling my bid and the job was being awarded them. And I would have to go and do the job according to my bid and I would expect them to do the same.”</p>
<p id="03437578-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant refused to do the paving work for less than $15,000. Plaintiff testified that he “got figures from other people” and after trying for several months to get as low a bid as possible engaged L &amp; H Paving Company, a firm in Lancaster, to do the work for $10,948.60.</p>
<p id="03437579-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court found on substantial evidence that defendant made a definite offer to do the paving on the Monte Vista job according to the plans and specifications for $7,131.60, and that plaintiff relied on defendant’s bid in computing his own bid for the school job and naming defendant therein as the subcontractor for the paving work. Accordingly, it entered judgment for plaintiff in the amount of $3,817.00 (the difference between defendant’s bid and the cost of the paving to plaintiff) plus costs.</p>
<p id="0343757a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant contends that there was no enforceable contract between the parties on the ground that it made a revocable offer and revoked it before plaintiff communicated his acceptance to defendant.</p>
<p id="0343757b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no evidence that defendant offered to make its bid irrevocable in exchange for plaintiff’s use of its figures in computing his bid. Nor is there evidence that would warrant interpreting plaintiff’s use of defendant’s bid as the acceptance thereof, binding plaintiff, on condition he received the main contract, <span title="279" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-279">p. 279</span>to award the subcontract to defendant. In sum, there was neither an option supported by consideration nor a bilateral contract binding on both parties.</p>
<p id="03439c8c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff contends, however, that he relied to his detriment on defendant’s offer and that defendant must therefore answer in damages for its refusal to perform. Thus the question is squarely presented: Did plaintiff’s reliance make defendant’s offer irrevocable?</p>
<p id="03439c8d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 90 of the Restatement of Contracts states: “A promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance of a definite and substantial character on the part of the promisee and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.” This rule applies in this state. . . . </p>
<p id="03439c8e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant’s offer constituted a promise to perform on such conditions as were stated expressly or by implication therein or annexed thereto by operation of law. (See 1 Williston, Contracts [3d ed.], §24A, p. 56, §61, p. 196.) Defendant had reason to expect that if its bid proved the lowest it would be used by plaintiff. It induced “action . . . of a definite and substantial character on the part of the promisee.”</p>
<p id="03439c8f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Had defendant’s bid expressly stated or clearly implied that it was revocable at any time before acceptance we would treat it accordingly. It was silent on revocation, however, and we must therefore determine whether there are conditions to the right of revocation imposed by law or reasonably inferable in fact. In the analogous problem of an offer for a unilateral contract, the theory is now obsolete that the offer is revocable at any time before complete performance. Thus section 45 of the Restatement of Contracts provides: “If an offer for a unilateral contract is made, and part of the consideration requested in the offer is given or tendered by the offeree in response thereto, the offeror is bound by a contract, the duty of immediate performance of which is conditional on the full consideration being given or tendered within the time stated in the offer, or, if no time is stated therein, within a reasonable time.” In explanation, Comment <i>b</i> states that the “main offer includes as a subsidiary promise, necessarily implied, that if part of the requested performance is given, the offeror will not revoke his offer, and that if tender is made it will be accepted. Part performance or tender may thus furnish consideration for the subsidiary promise. Moreover, merely acting in justifiable reliance on an offer may in some cases serve as sufficient reason for making a promise binding (see §90).”</p>
<p id="03439c90-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether implied in fact or law, the subsidiary promise serves to preclude the injustice that would result if the offer could be revoked after the offeree had acted in detrimental reliance thereon. Reasonable reliance resulting in a foreseeable prejudicial change in position affords a compelling basis also for implying a subsidiary promise not to revoke an offer for a bilateral contract.</p>
<p id="03439c91-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The absence of consideration is not fatal to the enforcement of such a promise. It is true that in the case of unilateral contracts the Restatement finds consideration for the implied subsidiary promise in the part performance of the bargained-for exchange, but its reference to section 90 makes clear that consideration for such a promise is not always necessary. The very purpose of section 90 is to make a promise binding even though there was no <span title="280" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-280">p. 280</span>consideration “in the sense of something that is bargained for and given in exchange.” (See 1 Corbin, Contracts 634 et seq.) Reasonable reliance serves to hold the offeror in lieu of the consideration ordinarily required to make the offer binding. In a case involving similar facts the Supreme Court of South Dakota stated that</p>

<p id="03439c92-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">we believe that reason and justice demand that the doctrine [of section 90] be applied to the present facts. We cannot believe that by accepting this doctrine as controlling in the state of facts before us we will abolish the requirement of a consideration in contract cases, in any different sense than an ordinary estoppel abolishes some legal requirement in its application. We are of the opinion, therefore, that the defendants in executing the agreement [which was not supported by consideration] made a promise which they should have reasonably expected would induce the plaintiff to submit a bid based thereon to the Government, that such promise did induce this action, and that injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.</p>

Ingersoll-Rand Co., 7 Cir., 117 F.2d 654, 661; cf. James Baird Co. v. Gimbel Bros., 2 Cir., 64 F.2d 344.</p>
<p id="03439c94-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When plaintiff used defendant’s offer in computing his own bid, he bound himself to perform in reliance on defendant’s terms. Though defendant did not bargain for this use of its bid neither did defendant make it idly, indifferent to whether it would be used or not. On the contrary it is reasonable to suppose that defendant submitted its bid to obtain the subcontract. It was bound to realize the substantial possibility that its bid would be the lowest, and that it would be included by plaintiff in his bid. It was to its own interest that the contractor be awarded the general contract; the lower the subcontract bid, the lower the general contractor’s bid was likely to be and the greater its chance of acceptance and hence the greater defendant’s chance of getting the paving subcontract. Defendant had reason not only to expect plaintiff to rely on its bid but to want him to. Clearly defendant had a stake in plaintiff’s reliance on its bid. Given this interest and the fact that plaintiff is bound by his own bid, it is only fair that plaintiff should have at least an opportunity to accept defendant’s bid after the general contract has been awarded to him.</p>
<p id="03439c95-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It bears noting that a general contractor is not free to delay acceptance after he has been awarded the general contract in the hope of getting a better price. Nor can he reopen bargaining with the subcontractor and at the same time claim a continuing right to accept the original offer. See, R. J. Daum Const. Co. v. Child, Utah, 247 P.2d 817, 823. In the present case plaintiff promptly informed defendant that plaintiff was being awarded the job and that the subcontract was being awarded to defendant.</p>
<p id="03439c96-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant contends, however, that its bid was the result of mistake and that it was therefore entitled to revoke it. It relies on the rescission cases of M. F. Kemper Const. Co. v. City of Los Angeles, 37 Cal. 2d 696, 235 P.2d 7, and Brunzell Const. Co. v. G. J. Weisbrod, Inc., 134 Cal. App. 2d 278, <span title="281" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-281">p. 281</span>285 P.2d 989. See also, Lemoge Electric v. San Mateo County, 46 Cal. 2d 659, 662, 297 P.2d 638. In those cases, however, the bidder’s mistake was known or should have been known to the offeree, and the offeree could be placed in status quo. Of course, if plaintiff had reason to believe that defendant’s bid was in error, he could not justifiably rely on it, and section 90 would afford no basis for enforcing it. Robert Gordon, Inc. v. Ingersoll-Rand, Inc., 7 Cir., 117 F.2d 654, 660. Plaintiff, however, had no reason to know that defendant had made a mistake in submitting its bid, since there was usually a variance of 160 per cent between the highest and lowest bids for paving in the desert around Lancaster. He committed himself to performing the main contract in reliance on defendant’s figures. Under these circumstances defendant’s mistake, far from relieving it of its obligation, constitutes an additional reason for enforcing it, for it misled plaintiff as to the cost of doing the paving. Even had it been clearly understood that defendant’s offer was revocable until accepted, it would not necessarily follow that defendant had no duty to exercise reasonable care in preparing its bid. It presented its bid with knowledge of the substantial possibility that it would be used by plaintiff; it could foresee the harm that would ensue from an erroneous underestimate of the cost. Moreover, it was motivated by its own business interest. Whether or not these considerations alone would justify recovery for negligence had the case been tried on that theory (see Biakanja v. Irving, 49 Cal. 2d 647, 650, 320 P.2d 16), they are persuasive that defendant’s mistake should not defeat recovery under the rule of section 90 of the Restatement of Contracts. As between the subcontractor who made the bid and the general contractor who reasonably relied on it, the loss resulting from the mistake should fall on the party who caused it.</p>
<p id="03439c97-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Leo F. Piazza Paving Co. v. Bebek &amp; Brkich, 141 Cal. App. 2d 226, 296 P.2d 368, 371, and Bard v. Kent, 19 Cal. 2d 449, 122 P.2d 8, 139 A.L.R. 1032, are not to the contrary. In the <i>Piazza</i> case the court sustained a finding that defendants intended, not to make a firm bid, but only to give the plaintiff “some kind of an idea to use” in making its bid; there was evidence that the defendants had told plaintiff they were unsure of the significance of the specifications. There was thus no offer, promise, or representation on which the defendants should reasonably have expected the plaintiff to rely. The <i>Bard</i> case held that an option not supported by consideration was revoked by the death of the optionor. The issue of recovery under the rule of section 90 was not pleaded at the trial, and it does not appear that the offeree’s reliance was “of a definite and substantial character” so that injustice could be avoided “only by the enforcement of the promise.”</p>
<p id="03439c98-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no merit in defendant’s contention that plaintiff failed to state a cause of action, on the ground that the complaint failed to allege that plaintiff attempted to mitigate the damages or that they could not have been mitigated. Plaintiff alleged that after defendant’s default, “plaintiff had to procure the services of the L &amp; H Co. to perform said asphaltic paving for the sum of $10,948.60.” Plaintiff’s uncontradicted evidence showed that he spent <span title="282" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-282">p. 282</span>several months trying to get bids from other subcontractors and that he took the lowest bid. Clearly he acted reasonably to mitigate damages. In any event any uncertainty in plaintiff’s allegation as to damages could have been raised by special demurrer. Code Civ. Proc. §430, subd. 9.

<li class=""><p id="0343c2ad-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Reasonable reliance on an offer</i>. In his opinion Justice Traynor first discusses Restatement of Contracts §45, which provides protection to the offeree against revocation of an offer to enter into a unilateral contract when the offeree has relied on the offer by beginning the requested performance. We previously discussed §45 in connection with Cook v. Coldwell Banker in Chapter 2. While <i>Drennan</i> involves an offer to enter into a bilateral contract, Justice Traynor concludes that protection against revocation of an offer should also apply in that situation when the offeree has reasonably relied resulting in foreseeable prejudice. Justice Traynor bases his analysis on the first Restatement of Contracts §90.</p>
<p id="0343c2ae-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Drennan</i> case was decided in 1958, some 25 years after the <i>James Baird</i> decision, but well before the promulgation of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts. When the revised Restatement was prepared, its drafters endorsed the <i>Drennan</i> result, but put forth a new corollary to §90, to reflect the fact that — as Judge Hand had earlier maintained — the legal term “offer” is not quite synonymous with “promise.” In the new §87(2), the Restatement (Second) agrees with the proposition that an offeree may in some cases reasonably and detrimentally rely on an offer that she has not yet accepted. Much of Justice Traynor’s discussion in <i>Drennan</i> is devoted to explaining why in that case the plaintiff offeree’s reliance was reasonable, and deserving of protection. Do you understand his argument? Do you agree with him? So far, relatively few cases have applied §87(2) outside of the construction-bidding situation exemplified by <i>Drennan</i> itself. Compare First National Bankshares of Beloit, Inc. v. Geisel, 853 F. Supp. 1344 (D. Kan. 1994) (under Kansas law as established by <i>Berryman</i>, promissory estoppel available to enforce option to sell stock in bank, but summary judgment granted for defendants because plaintiffs failed to establish detrimental reliance) with Strata Prod. Co. v. Mercury Exploration Co., 916 P.2d 822 (N.M. 1996) (promissory estoppel applied to make oil and gas “farmout” agreement irrevocable for period of time stated in option plus extension; §87(2) cited with approval).</p></li>

If so, <i>Drennan</i> has clearly prevailed. Since that case was decided, the <span title="283" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-283">p. 283</span>overwhelming majority of courts that have considered this type of case have accepted Justice Traynor’s analysis. Examples include APAC-Southeast, Inc. v. Coastal Caisson Corp., 514 F. Supp. 2d 1373 (N.D. Ga. 2007); Weitz Co. v. Hands, Inc., 882 N.W.2d 659 (Neb. 2016); contra Home Electric Co. v. Hall &amp; Underdown Heating &amp; Air Cond. Co., 358 S.E.2d 539 (N.C. Ct. App. 1987), <i>aff’d,</i> 366 S.E.2d 441 (1988) (<i>per curiam</i>). See also Hottinger Excavating &amp; Ready Mix, LLC, v. R.E. Crawford Constr., LLC, 2016 WL 9735771 (D. Colo.) (applying principle of <i>Drennan</i> to suit by general contractor against subcontractor). Although the essence of promissory estoppel might seem to be a case-by-case examination of all the factors that could cause the court’s sense of injustice to be aroused, in practice the <i>Drennan</i> line of cases appears to have matured to the point where establishment of the basic facts will entitle the plaintiff general contractor to judgment more or less automatically, unless the defendant subcontractor can take the case out of the ordinary run by demonstrating some additional factor in its favor. E.g., Crook v. Mortenson-Neal, 727 P.2d 297 (Alaska 1986) (despite some post-award bargaining over terms of proposed subcontract, defendant subcontractor’s defense properly characterized by trial court as so “weak” and “incredible” as to be “bordering on bad faith,” justifying award of attorney fees to plaintiff general contractor).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0343c2b0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Limitations on the</i> <b><i>Drennan</i></b> <i>rule.</i> In <i>Drennan</i> the court indicated in dictum several situations in which the general contractor would not be allowed to invoke the protections of promissory estoppel. If the defendant’s bid had “expressly stated or clearly implied that it was revocable at any time before acceptance,” the court would have “treat[ed] it accordingly.” Even such language might not be sufficient to preserve for the offeror the power of free revocability, however. In Lyon Metal Products, Inc. v. Hagerman Construction Corp., 391 N.E.2d 1152 (Ind. Ct. App. 1979), the defendant subcontractor’s offer was in response to specifications that required (with respect to the general contract) that all bids submitted by general contractors remain open for 120 days. Defendant’s bid was on a quotation form that stated (on the reverse side, in small print), “This quotation may be withdrawn and is subject to change without notice after 15 days from the date of quotation.” Judgment in favor of the plaintiff general contractor on the basis of promissory estoppel was affirmed by the Indiana Court of Appeals. In response to the defendant’s argument based on the above language, the court held that the trial court could have inferred that Lyon did not intend the 15-day clause to be the controlling time period but rather the 120-day period found in the specifications. But cf. Jackman Construction, Inc. v. Rock Springs Winnelson Co., 385 P.3d 311 (Wyo. 2016) (<i>Lyon</i> distinguished; subcontractor’s clearly stated bid expiration date enforced).</p>
<p id="0343c2b1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition, inequitable conduct by the general contractor may preclude the use of promissory estoppel. Two such situations involve “bid shopping,” the practice of trying to find another subcontractor who will do the work more cheaply while continuing to claim that the original bidder is bound, and “bid chopping,” the attempt to renegotiate with the bidder to reduce the price. See Lahr Construction Corp. v. J. Kozel &amp; Son, Inc., 640 N.Y.S.2d 957 (Sup. Ct. <span title="284" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-284">p. 284</span>1996).

<li class=""><p id="0343e9c2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Bidding statutes.</i> Some states have enacted statutes to protect subcontractors from bid shopping by general contractors in connection with government contracts. See Gregory &amp; Travers, Ethical Challenges of Bid Shopping, note 3 above, at 33, n.30. Such statutes commonly restrict the general contractor’s freedom to substitute other subcontractors for those listed by it in the bid on the general contract without the approval of the granting authority. E.g., Cal. Pub. Contract Code §4107. The statute provides a list of circumstances under which a general contractor may seek the consent of the public agency to substitution of a subcontractor.</p></li>

Despite arguments advanced in favor of a symmetrical, “both-parties-are-bound-or-neither-is-bound” approach, however, the decisions have continued to follow the <i>Drennan</i> approach, invoking promissory estoppel to protect the general contractor against the subcontractor’s withdrawal while declining to find the general contractor bound to a particular sub-merely because its sub-bid was used.

<p id="034410e4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to Taube, she and Phoenix specifically discussed the boardwalk property occupied at that time by a business trading as “The Players Club.” These discussions included Taube’s concerns with the then-current rental fees and Phoenix’s indication that Resorts management and Merv Griffin personally<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BCC_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10BCC_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">2</a></span> were “very anxious to have Pop’s as a tenant” and that “financial issues . . . could easily be resolved, such as through a percentage of gross revenue.” In order to allay both Taube’s and Phoenix’s concerns about whether a TCBY franchise at The Players Club location would be successful, Phoenix offered to permit Pop’s to operate a vending cart within Resorts free of charge during the summer of 1994 so as to “test the traffic flow.” This offer was considered and approved by Paul Ryan, Vice President for Hotel Operations at Resorts.</p>
<p id="034410e6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These discussions led to further meetings with Phoenix about the Players Club location, and Taube contacted TCBY’s corporate headquarters about a possible franchise site change. During the weekend of July 4, 1994, Pop’s opened the TCBY cart for business at Resorts pursuant to the above stated offer. On July 6, 1994, TCBY gave Taube initial approval for Pop’s change in franchise site. In late July or early August of 1994, representatives of TCBY personally visited the Players Club location, with Taube and Phoenix present.</p>
<p id="034437f7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Based on Pop’s marketing assessment of the Resorts location, Taube drafted a written proposal dated August 18, 1994, addressing the leasing of Resorts’ Players Club location and hand-delivered it to Phoenix. Taube’s proposal offered Resorts “7% of net monthly sales (gross less sales tax) for the duration of the <span title="287" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-287">p. 287</span>[Player’s Club] lease . . .

<p id="034437f8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In mid-September 1994, Taube spoke with Phoenix about the status of Pop’s lease proposal and “pressed [him] to advise [her] of Resorts’ position. [Taube] specifically advised [Phoenix] that Pop’s had an option to renew the lease for its Margate location and then needed to give notice to its landlord of whether it would be staying at that location no later than October 1, 1994.” Another conversation about this topic occurred in late September when Taube “asked Phoenix if [Pop’s] proposal was in the ballpark of what Resorts was looking for.” He responded that it was and that “we are 95% there, we just need Belisle’s<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BE0_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10BE0_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">3</a></span> signature on the deal.” Taube admits to having been advised that Belisle had “ultimate responsibility for signing off on the deal” but that Phoenix “assured [her] that Mr. Belisle would follow his recommendation, which was to approve the deal, and that [Phoenix] did not anticipate any difficulties.” During this conversation, Taube again mentioned to Phoenix that she had to inform her landlord by October 1, 1994, about whether or not Pop’s would renew its lease with them. Taube stated: “Mr. Phoenix assured me that we would have little difficulty in concluding an agreement and advised [Taube] to give notice that [Pop’s] would not be extending [its] Margate lease and ‘to pack up the Margate store and plan on moving.’ ”</p>
<p id="034437fa-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Relying upon Phoenix’s “advice and assurances,” Taube notified Pop’s landlord in late-September 1994 that it would not be renewing the lease for the Margate location.</p>
<p id="034437fb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In early October, Pop’s moved its equipment out of the Margate location and placed it in temporary storage. Taube then commenced a number of new site preparations including: (1) sending designs for the new store to TCBY in October 1994; and (2) retaining an attorney to represent Pop’s in finalizing the terms of the lease with Resorts.</p>

<p id="03445f15-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In early-December 1994, Taube and her attorney met with William Murtha, General Counsel of Resorts, and Paul Ryan to finalize the proposed lease. After a number of discussions about the lease, Murtha and Ryan informed Taube that they desired to reschedule the meeting to finalize the lease until after the first of the year because of a public announcement they intended to make about another unrelated business venture that Resorts was about to commence. Ryan again assured Taube that rent for the Players Club space was not an issue and that the lease terms would be worked out. “He also assured [Taube] that Resorts wanted TCBY . . . on the boardwalk for the following season.”</p>
<p id="03445f16-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Several attempts were made in January 1995 to contact Resorts’ representatives and confirm that matters were proceeding. On January 30, 1995, Taube’s attorney received a letter stating: “This letter is to confirm our conversation of this date wherein I advised that Resorts is withdrawing its December 1, 1994 offer to lease space to your client, TCBY.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C27_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10C27_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">4</a></span></p>
<p id="03445f18-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to Taube’s certification, “As soon as [Pop’s] heard that Resorts was withdrawing its offer, we undertook extensive efforts to reopen [the] franchise at a different location. Because the Margate location had been re-let, it was not available.” Ultimately, Pop’s found a suitable location but did not reopen for business until July 5, 1996.</p>
<p id="03445f19-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On July 17, 1995, Pop’s filed a complaint against Resorts seeking damages. The complaint alleged that Pop’s “reasonably relied to its detriment on the promises and assurances of Resorts that it would be permitted to relocate its operation to [Resorts’] Boardwalk location. . . .”</p>
<p id="03445f1a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After substantial pre-trial discovery, defendant moved for summary judgment.

A promissory estoppel claim will be justified if the plaintiff satisfies its burden of demonstrating the existence of, or for purposes of summary judgment, a dispute as to a material fact with regard to, four separate elements which include:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03445f1d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(1) a clear and definite promise by the promisor; (2) the promise must be made with the expectation that the promisee will rely thereon; (3) the promisee must in fact reasonably rely on the promise, and (4) detriment of a definite and substantial nature must be incurred in reliance on the promise.</p>
</div>
<p id="03445f1e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The essential justification for the promissory estoppel doctrine is to avoid the substantial hardship or injustice which would result if such a promise were not enforced. Id. at 484, 395 A.2d 222.</p>
<p id="03445f1f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Malaker,</i> the court determined that an implied promise to lend an unspecified amount of money was not “a clear and definite promise” justifying application of the promissory estoppel doctrine. Id. at 478-81, 395 A.2d 222. Specifically, the court concluded that the promisor-bank’s oral promise in October 1970 to lend $150,000 for January, February and March of 1971 was not “clear and definite promise” because it did not describe a promise of “sufficient definition.” Id. at 479, 395 A.2d 222.</p>
<p id="03445f20-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It should be noted that the court in <i>Malaker</i> seems to have heightened the amount of proof required to establish a “clear and definite promise” by searching for “<i>an express promise</i> of a ‘clear and definite’ nature.” Id. at 484, 395 A.2d 222 (emphasis added). This sort of language might suggest that New Jersey Courts expect proof of most, if not all, of the essential legal elements of a promise before finding it to be “clear and definite.”</p>
<p id="03445f21-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although earlier New Jersey decisions discussing promissory estoppel seem to greatly scrutinize a party’s proofs regarding an alleged “clear and definite promise by the promisor,” see, e.g., id. at 479, 484, 395 A.2d 222, as a prelude to considering the remaining three elements of a promissory estoppel claim, more recent decisions have tended to relax the strict adherence to the <i>Malaker</i> formula for determining whether a prima facie case of promissory estoppel exists. This is particularly true where, as here, a plaintiff does not seek to enforce a contract not fully negotiated, but instead seeks damages resulting from its detrimental reliance upon promises made during contract negotiations despite the ultimate failure of those negotiations.</p>

He approaches B, a franchisor of supermarkets. B states to A that for $18,000 B will establish A in a store. B also advises A to move to another town and buy a small grocery to gain experience. A does so. Later B advises A to sell the grocery, which A does, taking a capital loss and foregoing expected profits from the summer tourist trade. B also advises A to sell his bakery to raise capital for the supermarket franchise, saying “Everything is ready to go. Get your money together and we are set.” A sells the bakery taking a capital loss on this sale as well. Still later, B tells A that considerably more than an $18,000 investment will be needed, and the negotiations between the parties collapse. At the point of collapse many details of the proposed agreement between the parties are unresolved. The assurances from B to A are promises on which B reasonably should have expected A to rely, and A is entitled to his actual losses on the sales of the bakery and grocery and for his moving and temporary living expenses. Since the proposed agreement was never made, however, A is not entitled to lost profits from the sale of the grocery or to his expectation interest in the proposed franchise from B.</p>

<p id="0344863b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The facts as presented by plaintiff by way of its pleadings and certifications filed by Taube, which were not refuted or contradicted by defendant before the motion judge or on appeal, clearly show that when Taube informed Phoenix that Pop’s option to renew its lease at its Margate location had to be exercised by October 1, 1994, Phoenix instructed Taube to give notice that it would not be extending the lease. According to Phoenix, virtually nothing remained to be resolved between the parties. Phoenix indicated that the parties were “95% there” and that all that was required for completion of the deal was the signature of John Belisle. Phoenix assured Taube that he had recommended the deal to Belisle, and that Belisle would follow the recommendation. Phoenix also advised Pop’s to “pack up the Margate store and plan on moving.”</p>
<p id="0344863c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is also uncontradicted that based upon those representations that Pop’s, in fact, did not renew its lease. It vacated its Margate location, placed its equipment and personalty into temporary storage, retained the services of an attorney to finalize the lease with defendant, and engaged in planning the relocation to defendant’s property. Ultimately, it incurred the expense of relocating to its present location. That plaintiff . . . relied to its detriment on defendant’s assurances seems unquestionable; the facts clearly at least raise a jury question. Additionally, whether plaintiff’s reliance upon defendant’s assurances was reasonable is also a question for the jury.</p>

<p id="0344ad4e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The principle of this Section is flexible. The promisor is affected only by reliance which he does or should foresee, and enforcement must be necessary to avoid injustice. Satisfaction of the latter requirement may depend on the reasonableness of the promisee’s reliance, on its definite and substantial character in relation to the remedy sought, on the formality with which the promise is made, on the extent to which evidentiary, cautionary, deterrent and channeling functions of form are met by the commercial setting or otherwise, and on the extent to which such other policies as the enforcement of bargains and the prevention of unjust enrichment are relevant. . . . </p>

<li class=""><p id="0344ad54-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Requirement of a promise.</i> In <i>Pop’s Cones</i> the court dispensed with the requirement indicated by some prior New Jersey decisions that promissory estoppel must be based on a “clear and definite promise.” Sections 90 and 87(2) of the Restatement are in accord that a promise or offer will be sufficient without any heightened requirements of proof. Some courts, however, continue to adhere to this increased standard. See Jensen v. Taco John’s International, Inc., 110 F.3d 525 (8th Cir. 1997). Would Resorts’s promise have met even the greater standard of a “clear and definite promise”?</p>
<p id="0344ad55-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if a court rejects the standard of a clear and definite promise, not every assurance will be sufficient to invoke promissory estoppel. Compare Security Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Bogard, 494 N.E.2d 965 (Ind. Ct. App. 1986) (assurances by defendant bank’s branch manager that plaintiff’s application would go to loan committee and “within two or three days, we ought to have something here, ready for you to go with” held to be merely an “expression of intention” coupled with a “prediction” which were not sufficient to invoke promissory estoppel) with Twin City Fire Insurance Co. v. Philadelphia Life Insurance Co., 795 F.2d 1417 (9th Cir. 1986) (quote by defendant insurance broker of cost of annuity that plaintiff relied on in settlement of personal injury claim amounted to sufficient commitment to invoke promissory estoppel). In BH 329 NB LLC v. CBRE, Inc., 2017 WL 3641566 (D.N.J.), defendant seller’s assurances to plaintiff would-be <span title="292" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-292">p. 292</span>buyer of real property that defendant would not attempt to market property to others while negotiations continued, coupled with plaintiff’s reliance in making expenditures and forgoing other opportunities, were held to potentially justify liability on promissory estoppel basis; <i>Pop’s Cones</i> was cited and relied on.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0344ad56-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The</i> <b><i>Hoffman</i></b> <i>case.</i> The court cites with approval Hoffman v. Red Owl Stores, Inc., 133 N.W.2d 267 (Wis. 1967), a leading decision holding that assurances made during negotiations that a contract will be forthcoming amount to a promise sufficient to invoke promissory estoppel, when the promisee has relied to its detriment by giving up another business location and by incurring out-of-pocket expenses in preparation for the new location. As the court notes, the facts of <i>Hoffman</i> form the basis of Illustration 10 to Restatement (Second) §90, quoted in full by the court. See generally William C. Whitford &amp; Stewart Macaulay, Hoffman v. Red Owl Stores: The Rest of the Story, 61 Hastings L.J. 801 (2010).</p>
<p id="0344ad57-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We earlier saw that in the construction bidding cases most courts and the Restatement have adopted the holding of Drennan v. Star Paving, allowing a general contractor to recover on the basis of promissory estoppel against a subcontractor who attempts to revoke a bid. Does the fact pattern presented by <i>Pop’s Cones</i> and <i>Hoffman</i> present a stronger or weaker basis for invoking promissory estoppel than the type of situation illustrated by <i>Drennan</i>?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0344ad58-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Nature of the parties.</i> To what extent do cases like <i>Pop’s Cones</i> and <i>Hoffman</i> turn on the plaintiffs’ relative lack of business sophistication, as compared to the agents of the defendants? In Gruen Industries, Inc. v. Biller, 608 F.2d 274 (7th Cir. 1979), the court considered a claim for breach of an asserted promise to sell to plaintiff a controlling block of stock in a business corporation. Since Wisconsin law applied, the principles of Hoffman v. Red Owl governed the case. After finding that the agreement between the parties was not intended to be binding until negotiations were complete, the court went on to hold also that promissory estoppel did not apply. The court distinguished <i>Hoffman</i> on a number of points: Any promises were conditional; plaintiffs were represented by sophisticated agents (banker and attorney); both parties had made expenditures in reliance on the likelihood of agreement; the defendants were not in any way enriched by plaintiffs’ reliance. It then concluded as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="0344ad59-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In summary, the plaintiffs’ promissory estoppel argument seeks to transform these complex negotiations into a “no lose” situation. Every business man faces the risk that the substantial transaction costs necessary to bring about a mutually beneficial contract will be lost if the negotiations fail to yield a satisfactory agreement. It is difficult to find the degree of injustice necessary for recovery in estoppel when the promises incorporate so many contingencies and complexities and as a matter of sound business practice are to be formalized before the parties carry them out. We conclude on this basis that the losses are best left where they have fallen, because it is clear that no injustice will result from not enforcing the alleged promise.</p>

<p id="0344ad5a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Id. at 282. Compare 1861 Group, L.L.C. v. Wild Oats Markets, Inc., 728 F. Supp. 2d 1052, 1064 (E.D. Mo. 2010) (denying promissory estoppel claim by landlord against tenant on the ground that “it was unreasonable as a matter <span title="293" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-293">p. 293</span>of law for a sophisticated landlord to rely on such promises from a tenant”) with United Parcel Service Co. v. Rickert, 996 S.W.2d 464 (Ky. 1999) (plaintiff pilot permitted to recover both in fraud and in promissory estoppel against defendant, on the basis that he had been assured continuing employment with defendant if he remained for the time being in the employ of a contract air carrier with which defendant had maintained an ongoing relationship).</p>
<p id="0344ad5b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the issue of sophistication, see Meredith R. Miller, Contract Law, Party Sophistication and the New Formalism, 75 Mo. L. Rev. 493 (2010). Professor Miller argues that “sophistication” is a vague concept. She proposes a standard in which a court “assesses whether a party, relative to the other parties to the contract, has sufficient experience and access to information and resources that the person or entity understands or should understand the intricacies, risks and consequences of the transaction.” Id. at 497.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0344d46c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Plaintiff’s damages.</i> Pop’s Cones sought to recover what are usually referred to as “reliance” damages: the loss of income from the Margate location that it gave up in reliance on receiving a lease for the Resorts location coupled with its out-of-pocket expenses preparing for the Resorts lease. Pop’s could have attempted to recover “expectation” damages, the loss in income that it would have received from the Resorts location during the life of the lease. We will see in Chapter 11 that courts are divided on the question whether a plaintiff in a promissory estoppel case should be limited to its reliance damages or may recover its expectation damages, which are usually greater in amount.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0344d46d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Scholarly commentary.</i> A number of scholars have addressed the question of whether and the extent to which legal obligations should flow from assurances made during preliminary negotiations. In one of the earliest treatments of this subject, Professor Knapp suggested that assurances of a deal made during negotiations should in some cases give rise to a duty to bargain in good faith in an effort to conclude the negotiations.

She is also a faithful attender of a local church, the First Church of Springfield. The church has for some time been thinking of moving to a new location, closer to the residential center of the community, which has shifted substantially northward over the past several decades. Selma has been discussing with Reverend Lovejoy, the church’s minister, the possibility of selling to the church several <span title="294" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-294">p. 294</span>acres of land she owns on the edge of town, to be the site of a new church building.

<p id="0344d472-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a long-time member of First Church, I would be willing to sell to the church my 15-acre property on the north side of Springfield, on the road to Shelbyville. I believe this land is worth at least $800,000, but I would be willing to sell it to the church for $500,000, because I believe in your mission and have received much spiritual benefit from the church over the years. I know that this is a major step for your congregation, so I will leave this offer open for your consideration until the end of the year, to give you time to fully weigh this purchase.

They hired a local architect to draw plans for a potential new building on that site, and employed a professional fund-raising firm to evaluate the church’s potential for raising a capital investment of this size. At the same time, they considered the possibility of acquiring an alternate site on Evergreen Terrace in another part of town. Finally, in late September, they notified the owner of the Evergreen Terrace property that they were no longer interested, and prepared to contact Selma to communicate their intention to proceed with purchasing her land. Before they did so, however, they received the following handwritten note from Selma:</p>

<p id="0344fb8b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Restatement (Second) §87(1)(b) notes that an offer may be “made irrevocable by statute” and its comments refer to the fact that the Uniform Commercial Code has such provisions. The most important of those UCC sections for our purposes is the following provision in Article 2:<span title="295" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-295">p. 295</span></p>

<p id="0344fb8c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">§2-205 Firm Offer</p>
<p id="0344fb8d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An offer by a merchant to buy or sell goods in a signed writing which by its terms gives assurance that it will be held open is not revocable, for lack of consideration, during the time stated or if no time is stated for a reasonable time, but in no event may such period of irrevocability exceed three months; but any such term of assurance on a form supplied by the offeree must be separately signed by the offeror.</p>
</div>
<p id="0344fb8e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In §2-205, the drafters of Article 2 made a fundamental shift from traditional common law doctrine by providing that at least some offers will be irrevocable despite the absence of any consideration. Notably, the CISG takes an even more expansive attitude toward the possibility of “firm offers,” by giving legal effect to the apparent intention to make an offer binding, without the restrictions imposed by §2-205. CISG Art. 16(2)(a) (an offer cannot be revoked if it indicates “that it is irrevocable” by stating a fixed time for acceptance or by other means).</p>
<p id="0344fb8f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">UCC §2-205 applies to “offers,” a term which the Code does not define; accordingly, on this point general common law principles apply. See I &amp; R Mechanical, Inc. v. Hazelton Mfg. Co., 817 N.E.2d 799 (Mass. Ct. App. 2004) (price quotation not an offer under UCC §2-205). But note that many of the other terms employed in UCC §2-205, even those with everyday meanings, have specialized definitions in the Code. E.g., “merchant,” UCC §2-104(1); “goods,” UCC §2-105(1); “signed,” UCC §1-201(b)(37), and “writing,” UCC §1-201(b)(43). Observe also that UCC §2-205 applies to offers made by buyers as well as by sellers. E.g., City University of New York v. Finalco, Inc., 514 N.Y.S.2d 244 (App. Div. 1987) (buyer’s offer to purchase used computers from university not revocable during period stated). And of course the section only applies to an offer that is “firm” — i.e., that “gives assurance that it will be held open.”</p>
<p id="0344fb90-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two other aspects of UCC §2-205 may be important in applying it to a given situation. One is the length of the period of irrevocability that it creates. Clearly if an offer merely states that it is “firm,” but without saying for how long, the “reasonable” period of irrevocability created might be less than three months, but in any event under §2-205 would not <i>exceed</i> that time. If the offer does specify a period of firmness that is greater than three months, the period of irrevocability will be limited to three months unless consideration has been given or the firm offer is extended through a renewal. In re Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp., 360 B.R. 632, 639 (N.D. Ohio 2006); UCC §2-205 Comment 3. (On this point, compare CISG Art. 16(2)(a), which contains no similar time limitation.) The other point to be noted is UCC §2-205’s requirement that any “term of assurance [i.e., of ‘firmness’] on a form supplied by the offeree must be separately signed by the offeror.” What abuse were the drafters seeking here to avoid? Comment 4 indicates this provision offers protection “against the inadvertent signing of a firm offer.” Comment 2 elaborates on the requirement of a “signed writing,” and notes that a “signature” for this purpose would typically consist at a minimum of an “initialing of the clause involved.” If a given “offeror” would indeed “inadvertently” sign a firm offer, might she be likely <span title="296" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-296">p. 296</span>also to “inadvertently” initial a “firmness” clause? (Have you ever signed or initialed something without reading it?) Comment 4 suggests that in such cases UCC §2-302 might possibly be applied to prevent an “unconscionable result.”</p>

Although at first this was merely a hobby for Branch, many of his horses did very well on the track, and it has turned into a profitable business for him. In June of this year, Dorothy Gale comes to Branch’s property to have a look at Branch’s racehorse, “Tinman,” which she has heard might be for sale. Branch tells Gale that Tinman can be purchased for $500,000. After watching the horse in action over a two-day period, Gale tells Branch that she is indeed interested in buying the animal, but will not be in a position to do so unless and until she can assemble a group of investors to go in with her on the purchase, which will take some time. Branch asks her how long she would need, and Gale replies that four months should be ample. At Gale’s request, Branch signs the following:</p>

<p id="034522ac-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The material in this section introduces you to a body of law now known as “restitution.” In its inception, the law of restitution had contractual roots. Beginning in the latter part of the eighteenth century, however, judges and scholars began <span title="297" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-297">p. 297</span>to think of restitutionary actions as distinct from contract law. During the twentieth century, restitution broke away from its contractual origins and became a separate body of law. (This process is described in the Comment that follows the <i>Pelo</i> case, below.) Although restitution has achieved independence from contract law, the institution of contract is still extremely important to the law of restitution because restitutionary actions often arise out of contractual relationships. The Restatement (Third) of Restitution §1 succinctly states the basis of liability as follows: “A person who is unjustly enriched at the expense of another is subject to liability in restitution.” This formula identifies two elements that are central to restitutionary recovery: <i>enrichment</i> of one person under circumstances where the retention of benefits would be <i>unjust</i> to another person. But what is “enrichment”? And when is enrichment “unjust”? The materials that follow address these questions.</p>

<p id="034522af-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In all the preceding materials, we have focused primarily on the various reasons why the law might choose to enforce an apparently seriously intended promise. Suppose, however, that one party has received a benefit from another, but made no promise to pay for that benefit. Ordinarily, classical contract law would find no basis for imposing a promissory obligation in those circumstances. Might there still be some other form of legal obligation, based on principles of restitution? The following cases explore that possibility.</p>

<p id="034522ba-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On Sunday January 8, 1995, at 3:00 <span class="epub-small-caps">a.m</span>., the Hardin County Magistrate was contacted by Dr. Gude from the Ellsworth Municipal Hospital in Iowa Falls in regard to a patient, Russell N. Pelo. The record indicates that Pelo left his marital residence, after having an argument with his wife, and checked into a motel in Iowa Falls. Pelo later telephoned his wife “making threats of self harm” and purchased a shotgun. While the record is silent regarding the subsequent events, Pelo was apparently taken to the Ellsworth Municipal Hospital by the police, who had been advised of his threats.</p>
<p id="034549cb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Pursuant to the emergency hospitalization procedures set forth in Iowa Code section 229.22(3) and (4) (1995), the magistrate found probable cause <span title="298" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-298">p. 298</span>that Pelo was seriously mentally impaired and likely to physically injure himself. The magistrate thus entered an emergency hospitalization order on January 8, requiring that Pelo be detained in custody at the hospital’s psychiatric unit for examination and care for a period not to exceed forty-eight hours.</p>
<p id="034549cc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During admission to the hospital, Pelo was given a hospital release form to sign which would have made either Pelo or his insurance company responsible for the hospital bill. Pelo refused to sign the form. According to Pelo, at approximately five o’clock that morning, a nurse awakened him and demanded that he sign the hospital release form or the hospital could not insure the safety or return of his personal items. Pelo eventually read and signed the form. The form stated that Pelo understood he remained liable for any charges not covered by insurance.</p>
<p id="034549cd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thereafter, Pelo’s wife filed an application for involuntary hospitalization of Pelo pursuant to Iowa Code section 229.6 and apparently an order for immediate hospitalization was entered by a hospitalization referee under Iowa Code section 229.11.</p>
<p id="034549ce-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An evidentiary hearing was held before the judicial hospitalization referee on January 13, concerning Pelo’s commitment status. Medical reports and testimony were received by the referee. Pursuant to a written order, the hospitalization referee found that Pelo suffers from mental illness described as bipolar disorder, an illness from which Pelo has suffered for many years. In addition, the referee concluded “that although the Respondent [Pelo] clearly is in need of and would benefit from treatment for a serious mental illness, the required elements for involuntary hospitalization are lacking,” and that further involuntary hospitalization was not authorized. Pelo was released from the hospital and court jurisdiction as of January 13, 1995.</p>
<p id="034549cf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The hospital later sought compensation from Pelo in the amount of $2,775.79 for medical services provided to him from January 8 to January 13, 1995. Pelo refused to pay the bill or authorize his health insurance carrier to do so. The hospital later assigned its claim against Pelo concerning the hospital bill to plaintiff Credit Bureau Enterprises, Inc., for collection. Plaintiff Credit Bureau filed a petition against Pelo on the small claims docket in district court, seeking judgment on the hospital bill. Credit Bureau later also named Cerro Gordo county as a defendant, based on the theory that the county, Pelo’s county of legal settlement, would be liable for mental health services provided to Pelo. See Iowa Code §§230.1, 230.2.</p>
<p id="034549d0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At a hearing concerning plaintiff’s small claims petition, Pelo admitted that he was hospitalized from January 8 through January 13, 1995, but argued that he made no agreement to pay for services provided to him. Pelo explained that upon being admitted to the hospital, he refused to complete the hospital release form so that his health insurance carrier could be contacted for payment because he believed that he did not need evaluation or treatment. Pelo argued he later signed the release form under duress and that he did not agree to pay for medical services provided. Pelo stated he had health insurance and was not indigent at the time he was hospitalized.</p>
<p id="034549d1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The district associate judge concluded that there was no statutory requirement that Cerro Gordo county pay for medical services provided to Pelo during <span title="299" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-299">p. 299</span>his hospitalization because Pelo was hospitalized at a private hospital and not a state hospital. See Iowa Code §230.1. The court further concluded, however, that as a matter of public policy and under a reasonable interpretation of the involuntary commitment and mentally ill support statutes in Iowa Code chapters 229 and 230, Pelo could not be permitted to receive court-ordered services and then choose to ignore his responsibility to pay for those services. The court therefore entered judgment in favor of plaintiff Credit Bureau and against Pelo in the amount of $2,775.79, plus interest. The court also dismissed Credit Bureau’s claim against Cerro Gordo county.</p>
<p id="034549d2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under Iowa Code section 631.13, Pelo appealed to a district court judge the district associate court’s decision that he was personally liable for the hospital bill. However, neither Pelo nor the plaintiff appealed that portion of the decision dismissing plaintiff’s claim against Cerro Gordo county. The county is therefore not involved in this appeal and is out of the case.</p>
<p id="034549d3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On Pelo’s appeal, the district court judge affirmed. The court concluded that by signing the hospital form, Pelo had entered into a valid, enforceable contract to be financially responsible for the hospital bill. In doing so, the court rejected Pelo’s contention that the agreement was not enforceable because he allegedly signed the form under duress. In the alternative, the court concluded that Pelo was liable for payment of the hospital bill under a theory of contract implied in law or quasi-contract, based on the court’s conclusion that Pelo benefited from his hospitalization for which he should pay.</p>
<p id="034549d4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We granted Pelo’s application for discretionary review. See Iowa Code §631.16.</p>

<p id="034570e8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issue we must decide is who pays for mental health medical services provided to a patient who is involuntarily committed to a private hospital. To answer this question, we first examine the applicable statutes governing involuntary hospitalization procedures for persons with mental illness. [The court concludes that under statutory law, there is no clear requirement that the county of a patient’s residence pay for the cost of treatment at a private, as opposed to a public, hospital. Later statutory changes addressed the problem revealed in this case. — <span class="epub-small-caps">Eds</span>.]</p>

<p id="034570ec-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“A contract implied in law is an obligation imposed by the law without regard to either party’s expressions of assent either by words or acts.” Irons v. Community State Bank, 461 N.W.2d 849, 855 (Iowa App. 1990) (citing Corbin on Contracts §19 (1952)). Such contracts do not arise from the traditional bargaining process, but rather “rest on a legal fiction arising from considerations of justice and the equitable principles of unjust enrichment.” Hunter v. Union State Bank, 505 N.W.2d 172, 177 (Iowa 1993). As such, they are not real contracts and the general rules of contracts therefore do not apply to them. Id.; accord 1 Samuel Williston, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts §1:6, at 27 (Richard A. Lord ed., 4th ed. 1990) (hereinafter “Williston”). More specifically, the contracts clause of article I, section 10 of the United States Constitution does not apply to quasi-contracts. Williston, §1:6, at 27.</p>
<p id="034570ed-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Restitution and unjust enrichment are modern designations for the older doctrine of quasi contracts or contracts implied in law, sometimes called constructive contracts.” Robert’s River Rides v. Steamboat Dev. Corp., 520 N.W.2d 294, 302 (Iowa 1994) (citations omitted). The term “ ‘unjust enrichment is an equitable principle mandating that one shall not be permitted to unjustly enrich oneself at the expense of another or to receive property or benefits without making compensation for them.’ ” Id. (quoting West Branch State Bank v. Gates, 477 N.W.2d 848, 851-52 (Iowa 1991)). Under these principles, where a person acts to confer benefits on another in a setting in which the actor is not acting officiously, the benefited party may be required to make restitution to the actor. Okoboji Camp Owners Coop. v. Carlson, 578 N.W.2d 652, 654 (Iowa 1998) (citing Restatement of Restitution §§1, 2 (1936)). Thus, where a person performs services for another which are known to and accepted by the latter, the law implies a promise to pay for those services. Patterson v. Patterson’s Estate, 189 N.W.2d 601, 604 (Iowa 1971); Snyder v. Nixon, 188 Iowa 779, 781, 176 N.W. 808, 809 (1920) (“The general rule is that where one renders services of value to another with his knowledge and consent, the presumption is that the one rendering the services expects to be compensated, and that the one to whom the services are rendered intends to pay for the same, and so the law implies a promise to pay.”).</p>
<p id="034570ee-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Restatement of Restitution states that “[a] person who officiously<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10E9E_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10E9E_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">2</a></span> confers a benefit upon another is not entitled to restitution therefor.” Restatement of Restitution §2. Under this rule, recovery is denied so that one will not have to pay for a benefit forced upon one against one’s will, see 1 E. Allan Farnsworth, Farnsworth on Contracts §2.20, at 173 (2d ed. 1998), or for which one did not request or knowingly accept. See Nursing Care Servs. v. Dobos, 380 So. 2d 516, 518 (Fla. Dist. Ct.

<p id="0345bf1e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The district court concluded that Pelo benefitted by his hospitalization and that Pelo was liable for medical services rendered to him. Upon our review, we agree with the district court’s decision.</p>
<p id="0345bf1f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We first point out that Pelo does not challenge the factual basis for his hospitalization. Nor is it likely that such a challenge would be successful given the fact that the necessary probable cause findings concerning emergency <span title="302" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-302">p. 302</span>hospitalization by the magistrate, see Iowa Code §229.22(3), and involuntary commitment procedures by the hospitalization referee, see Iowa Code §229.11, were made. These factfinding requirements are in place to guarantee a patient’s liberty and due process interests when the state exercises its authority through emergency hospitalization and involuntary commitment proceedings. This authority is based on the standard for commitment, “serious mental impairment” as defined in section 229.1(14), which “melds the important elements of the police power and parens patriae doctrine.” B.A.A. v. University of Iowa Hosps., 421 N.W.2d 118, 122-23 (Iowa 1988) (discussing historical background of state’s authority in involuntary commitment proceedings).</p>
<p id="0345bf20-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Pelo also does not challenge the hospitalization referee’s finding that he suffers from mental illness described as bipolar disorder. Nor does Pelo challenge the district court’s finding that $2,775.79 was the reasonable cost of services provided to him during his hospitalization. Pelo contends, however, that he has no duty to pay for those services because he did not ask to be hospitalized and derived no benefit from his hospitalization. Pelo bases his argument, in part, on the hospitalization referee’s finding made after the commitment hearing that further hospitalization was not authorized (based on a finding that there was not clear and convincing evidence that Pelo was seriously mentally impaired, see Iowa Code §229.13). Pelo apparently interprets the referee’s decision to mean that he should not have been hospitalized in the first place and that he therefore derived no benefit from his hospitalization.</p>
<p id="0345bf21-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We find no merit in these contentions. First, the hospitalization referee’s final decision is not relevant to Pelo’s duty to pay for services previously rendered to him by the hospital. The referee’s decision only addressed the propriety of any <i>future</i> hospitalization, not whether there was an adequate basis for hospitalization of Pelo in the first place or whether he medically benefited from his hospitalization.</p>
<p id="0345bf22-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, Pelo’s opinion as to whether he needed or consented to medical services provided to him during his hospitalization is essentially irrelevant. This is because the emergency hospitalization order, which was based on the magistrate’s probable cause finding that Pelo was seriously mentally impaired, see Iowa Code §229.22(3), establishes that Pelo lacked sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions concerning hospitalization and lacked the ability to consent to treatment. See Iowa Code §229.1(14) (defining “seriously mentally impaired”).</p>
<p id="0345bf23-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Additionally, like the district court, we find that Pelo’s hospitalization was indeed of medical benefit to him. The hospital provided services to Pelo from January 8 to 13, 1995, in good faith and not gratuitously. Such services were provided for Pelo’s benefit, pursuant to court orders based on probable cause findings that Pelo was seriously mentally impaired and likely to injure himself or others if not immediately detained in the hospital. Based on the later reports of the physicians who examined and evaluated Pelo during his hospitalization, the referee found that Pelo “clearly is in need of and would benefit from treatment for a serious mental illness.” This finding, we believe, would at a minimum alert Pelo to the seriousness of his mental illness and the need for further treatment, a fact that would surely be of medical benefit to him. The fact that Pelo <span title="303" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-303">p. 303</span>was involuntarily hospitalized in order that this evaluation and finding could be made, and the fact that he may disagree with whether this finding is of medical benefit to him, does not eliminate the medical benefit he received from such hospitalization.</p>
<p id="0345bf24-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that plaintiff is entitled to recover the value of those medical services provided to Pelo. See Restatement of Restitution §116 cmt. b (if a person is otherwise not fully mentally competent, a person rendering necessaries or professional services is entitled to recover from such person although the person expresses an unwillingness to accept the services). The district court therefore properly determined that Pelo was legally obligated to pay for those services based on an implied in law contract theory.

These contentions have no merit. First, quasi-contracts are not true contracts and therefore the general rules of contract, including the constitutional provisions concerning the right to contract, do not apply to them.

Do you think that other claim should have succeeded? Consider Restatement (Second) of Contract §§174-177, “Duress and Undue Influence”; consider also §15, “Mental Illness or Defect.” We will consider those topics in Chapter 7, but at this point note that Pelo might well have had one or more effective defenses to contractual liability, given his apparent mental condition at the time he signed the form. In particular, regardless of whether the hospital is seen as having applied an “improper” threat to obtain his assent, the mere fact that the hospital was clearly aware of his mental state might well prevent its enforcement of any contractual obligation on his part.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0345e641-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Restitutionary liability for emergency services rendered.</i> As the court in <i>Pelo</i> points out, the Restatement (First) of Restitution §116 provided for restitution in favor of one furnishing emergency services in a situation where serious bodily harm or pain will otherwise result, provided the plaintiff acted “unofficiously.” Sometimes, as in In re Estate of Crisan, 107 N.W.2d 907 (Mich. 1961), the patient is unconscious when the care is rendered, and dies without ever regaining consciousness. Even more than in <i>Pelo,</i> there can be no question of “real” assent in such a case; to talk of an “implied contract” is clearly a legal fiction. Moreover, since in <i>Crisan</i> the patient did not recover, it is possible that the services ultimately did not “benefit” her. The restitutionary obligation will presumably lie anyway, however, based on the “reasonable value” of the services received. Cf. Doe v. HCA Health Services of Tennessee, Inc., 46 S.W.3d 191, 198-199 (Tenn. 2001) (even if price term in agreement between patient and hospital too indefinite for contract to be enforceable, patient can be liable for the reasonable value of services rendered, based on the costs of the hospital’s operation and the prices charged for similar services by other hospitals in the area). In other cases, however, the patient was conscious and could have entered into an agreement, and perhaps the issue of payment was even discussed, but no definite agreement was reached. In such a case, the provider will be able to recover the reasonable value of the care furnished, not under the rubric of Restatement (First) of Restitution §116, but on the more general restitutionary principle that one who receives services, with the knowledge that the person furnishing them reasonably expects to be paid, will be liable for the reasonable value of those services. See, e.g., the <i>Doe</i> case cited above, and Galloway v. Methodist Hospitals, Inc., cited by the court in <i>Pelo.</i> Section 20 of the Restatement (Third) of Restitution now provides:</p>

Contracts “implied in law” are “not real contracts,” the court declares; they “do not arise from the traditional bargaining process,” and “general rules of contracts . . . do not apply to them.” Despite the theoretical separation between “true” contract and “quasi” contract, they do have some potential overlap, as the Restatement (Third) of Restitution recognizes in the following provision:</p>

<p id="03460d5a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As Restatement (Third) of Restitution §107(2) states, when a person “requests another to perform services for him or to transfer property to him,” the law will infer a bargain to pay. Such cases are usually referred to as “implied-in-fact” contracts. Implied-in-fact contracts, like express contracts, are “true” contracts. While the distinction between implied-in-fact contracts and restitution claims may be hazy, the crucial factor will often be whether the party receiving the benefit of services or property had “requested” it. See Candace S. Kovacic, A Proposal to Simplify Quantum Meruit Litigation, 35 Am. U.L. Rev. 547, 550-551 (1986). If so, a claim based on implied-in-fact contract will lie. The distinction between implied-in-fact and implied-in-law contracts is discussed in more detail in the two cases that follow <i>Pelo.</i></p>
<p id="03460d5b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Frequently the distinction between express contract, implied-in-fact contract, and restitution will be immaterial. See Restatement (Third) of Restitution §107, cmt. <i>b.</i> However, sometimes the distinction will be important. In <i>Pelo,</i> for example, the court states that constitutional claims regarding the right to contract do not apply to restitutionary claims.

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03463474-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A doctor chances on a stranger lying unconscious on the street, treats him, and later demands a fee. Has he a legal claim? The law answer is yes. . . . </p>
<p id="03463475-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the case of the doctor, the costs of a voluntary transaction would be prohibitive. The reason is incapacity. In other cases it might be time (for example, the stranger is conscious but bleeding profusely, and there is no time to discuss terms). In such cases, the law considers whether, had transaction costs not been prohibitive, the parties would have come to terms, and if so, what (approximately) the terms would have been. If a court is reasonably confident both that there would have been a transaction and what its essential terms would have been (that the doctor use his best efforts and that the patient pay the doctor’s normal fee for treatment of the sort rendered), it does not hesitate to write a contract between the parties after the fact. . . . </p>
<p id="03463476-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But now suppose that a man stands under my window, playing the violin beautifully, and when he has finished, knocks on my door and demands a fee <span title="307" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-307">p. 307</span>for his efforts. Though I enjoyed his playing, I nonetheless refuse to pay anything for it. The court would deny the violinist’s claim for a fee — however reasonable the fee might appear to be — on the ground that, although the violinist conferred a benefit on me (and not with the intent that it be gratuitous), he did so officiously. Translated from legal into economic terminology, this means he conferred an unbargained-for benefit in circumstances where the costs of a voluntary bargain would have been low. In such cases the law insists that the voluntary route be followed — and is on firm economic grounds in doing so.</p>

According to Posner, when is it permissible for a court to impose an obligation to pay for benefits received even in the absence of an actual bargain?</p></li>

<p id="03463479-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of the most perplexing problems that students face in trying to understand the concept of restitution is a confusing array of terms: <i>implied contract, implied-in-fact contract, implied-in-law contract, quasi contract, common counts, quantum meruit,</i> and <i>quantum valebat,</i> to mention a few. The text that follows attempts to clarify this muddle by focusing on the historical development of the right to restitution. (Even if the textual material helps to clarify your understanding of these terms, do not be surprised if judges confuse the terms or use them loosely.)</p>
<p id="0346347a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before Slade’s Case, 76 Eng. Rep. 1074 (1602), the common law courts drew the boundary between the action of assumpsit and the action of debt on the basis of whether an express promise was made. If a person sold goods or provided services to another on request, the action of debt would lie against the recipient. If the recipient, in addition, expressly promised to pay for the goods or services after they were received, assumpsit was available. In Slade’s Case, the Exchequer Chamber held that every executory contract implied a promise. As a result, assumpsit would lie even in the absence of an express promise. Because it was more favorable procedurally than debt, assumpsit soon replaced debt as the action to recover the price of goods or services.</p>
<p id="0346347b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After Slade’s Case, standardized forms of pleading, called “common counts,” were developed for use in typical cases arising under assumpsit, such as actions to recover the promised price of goods sold, services performed, or money loaned. At about the same time, common counts were also developed for recovery of the reasonable value of goods delivered (“quantum valebat”) or services performed (“quantum meruit”). Technically, these actions were separate from assumpsit because the claim was for an unliquidated sum rather than a sum certain. Eventually, however, these new forms of action were absorbed into the general action of assumpsit. In all of these actions, liability was originally based on a consensual transaction. Soon, however, the courts expanded liability to nonconsensual situations by making use of the concept of an “implied <span title="308" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-308">p. 308</span>promise.” Thus, by the end of the seventeenth century, an action in assumpsit was also available in many nonconsensual situations. For example, if a bank or other commercial party made an overpayment by mistake, the amount of the overpayment could be recovered in an action of assumpsit. See A.W.B. Simpson, A History of the Common Law of Contract 489-505 (1987); James B. Ames, The History of Assumpsit (Pt. II), 2 Harv. L. Rev. 53, 63-69 (1888) (history of common law developments).</p>
<p id="0346347c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ultimately, the nonconsensual basis of some of the situations in which assumpsit was available was recognized and expressed. In 1760, in Moses v. Macferlan, 97 Eng. Rep. 676, Lord Mansfield faced the question of whether assumpsit could be used in an action for money had and received when no express agreement had been made and it was impossible under the facts to imply an agreement. Mansfield stated,</p>

<p id="0346347e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">97 Eng. Rep. at 678. After that time, it became common to speak of two types of implied contracts that were actionable in assumpsit, one being “implied-in-fact” and the other “implied-in-law” (quasi contract).</p>
<p id="0346347f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the United States, the concept of quasi-contractual liability founded on unjust enrichment was widely accepted, but the scope of liability remained unclear. In 1937, the American Law Institute (ALI) published its first Restatement of Restitution, a major attempt at systematic treatment of the field. The reporters for the Restatement consciously rejected the term <i>quasi contract,</i> selecting instead the label <i>restitution,</i> which was broader in at least two ways. First, while the term <i>quasi contract</i> implies a relationship to contract law, the modern law of restitution is based on unjust enrichment and has no particular relationship to contract. Although some restitutionary situations arise in a contractual context, many do not. For example, restitution is available when a person has wrongfully obtained property from another tortiously, by fraud or conversion. Second, at common law, the remedy in a quasi-contractual action was damages. In restitutionary actions, however, modern courts can fashion equitable remedies such as a “constructive trust” or “accounting.” Warren A. Seavey &amp; Austin W. Scott, Restitution, 54 L.Q. Rev. 29, 38-39 (1938) (discussing relationship between restitution and common law quasi-contractual actions).</p>
<p id="03465b90-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In more recent years, scholarship regarding restitution has continued to develop. See George E. Palmer, Law of Restitution (1978); Andrew Kull, Rationalizing Restitution, 83 Cal. L. Rev. 1191 (1995); Symposium: Restitution and Unjust Enrichment, 79 Tex. L. Rev. 1763 (2001). In 2011, the ALI adopted the Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment (cited in the following materials as the “Restatement (Third) of Restitution”), with Professor Andrew Kull as chief reporter. For an examination of various aspects of the revised Restatement, see Symposium, Restitution Rollout: The Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment, 68 Wash. &amp; Lee L.

<p id="03465b9a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the non-jury trial, Equity presented its direct case in under 30 minutes. Equity’s president testified that his company had contracted with the general contractor to stucco Commerce’s property for $17,100. He indicated that at the start of the job he expected payment only from the general contractor and not from Commerce. Both the general contractor and a representative from Commerce inspected the work as it progressed. After the work was completed, Commerce gave Equity a punch list of remedial work. When Equity’s president asked for at least partial payment from Commerce, the latter’s representative indicated that “he couldn’t do it.” Having received no payment, Equity did not complete the punch list. Equity brought suit against the general contractor, who later declared bankruptcy. Equity adduced no evidence regarding Commerce’s payments to the general contractor under the construction contract or to any other party for work covered by the contract.</p>
<p id="034682ab-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After Equity rested, Commerce moved for an involuntary dismissal, arguing that the evidence did not establish a contract implied in fact. Commerce’s attorney contended that the term “quantum meruit” was synonymous with a contract implied in fact. The trial court denied the motion. During closing argument, Equity asserted that it had established a claim for quantum meruit, which it interpreted to mean unjust enrichment. Arguing that a quasi contract claim had first been injected into the case during closing argument, Commerce’s attorney obtained permission to reopen his case. By this point in the trial, there was no agreement as to the cause of action at issue or the requirements of proof. The trial judge observed, “[w]e are in equity and I have some difficulty with wondering what the issues are and who is going to prove what.”</p>

Commerce also sought to introduce evidence that it had paid $64,097 directly to three subcontractors who had performed work on the building, who were not paid by the general contractor, and who had perfected mechanics’ liens.

<p id="034682b0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A contract implied in fact is one form of an enforceable contract; it is based on a tacit promise, one that is inferred in whole or in part from the parties’ conduct, not solely from their words. 17 Am. Jur. 2d “Contracts” §3 (1964); 1 Arthur Linton Corbin, Corbin on Contracts §§1.18-1.20 (Joseph M. Perillo ed. 1993). Where an agreement is arrived at by words, oral or written, the contract is said to be “express.” 17 Am. Jur. 2d “Contracts” at §3. A contract implied in fact is not put into promissory words with sufficient clarity, so a fact finder must examine and interpret the parties’ conduct to give definition to their unspoken agreement. Id.; 3 Corbin on Contracts §562 (1960). . . . </p>
<p id="034682b1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Common examples of contracts implied in fact are where a person performs services at another’s request, or “where services are rendered by one person for another without his expressed request, but with his knowledge, and under circumstances” fairly raising the presumption that the parties understood and intended that compensation was to be paid. . . . In these circumstances, the law implies the promise to pay a reasonable amount for the services. . . . </p>
<p id="034682b2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A contract implied in law, or quasi contract, is not based upon the finding, by a process of implication from the facts, of an agreement between the parties. A contract implied in law is a legal fiction, an obligation created by the law without regard to the parties’ expression of assent by their words or conduct. 1 Corbin on Contracts §1.20; . . . . The fiction was adopted to provide a remedy where one party was unjustly enriched, where that party received a benefit under circumstances that made it unjust to retain it without giving compensation. . . . </p>
<p id="034682b3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The elements of a cause of action for a quasi contract are that: (1) the plaintiff has conferred a benefit on the defendant; (2) the defendant has knowledge of the benefit; (3) the defendant has accepted or retained the benefit conferred and (4) the circumstances are such that it would be inequitable for the defendant to retain the benefit without paying fair value for it. Hillman Const. Corp. v. Wainer, 636 So. 2d 576, 577 (Fla. 4th DCA 1994); Henry M. Butler, Inc. v. Trizec Properties, Inc., 524 So. 2d 710, 711-12 (Fla. 2d DCA 1988). Because <span title="311" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-311">p. 311</span>the basis for recovery does not turn on the finding of an enforceable agreement, there may be recovery under a contract implied in law even where the parties had no dealings at all with each other. . . . This is unlike a contract implied in fact which must arise from the interaction of the parties or their agents.</p>
<p id="034682b4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To describe the cause of action encompassed by a contract implied in law, Florida courts have synonymously used a number of different terms — “quasi contract,” “unjust enrichment,” “restitution,” “constructive contract,” and “quantum meruit.” This profusion of terminology has its roots in legal history. Concerned about the confusion between contracts implied in law and fact, two legal scholars sought to “extirpate the term ‘contract implied in law’ from legal usage and to substitute for it the term “quasi contract.” 1 Corbin on Contracts §1.20. As Corbin explains, although the term “quasi contract” took hold, “the older term successfully resisted extirpation to the further confusion of law students and lawyers.” Id. . . . </p>
<p id="034682b5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At trial in this case, Commerce’s attorney understood “quantum meruit” to mean a contract implied in fact. Equity and the trial court were proceeding under a theory of quasi contract. This confusion over “quantum meruit” is understandable, since there are cases to support both positions. . . . </p>
<p id="0346a9c6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The blurring of the distinction between contract implied in fact and quasi contract has been exacerbated by the potential for both theories to apply to the same factual setting. For example, a common form of contract implied in fact is where one party has performed services at the request of another without discussion of compensation. These circumstances justify the inference of a promise to pay a reasonable amount for the service. The enforceability of this obligation turns on the implied promise, not on whether the defendant has received something of value. A contract implied in fact can be enforced even where a defendant has received nothing of value.</p>
<p id="0346a9c7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, where there is no enforceable express or implied in fact contract but where the defendant has received something of value, or has otherwise benefitted from the service supplied, recovery under a quasi contractual theory may be appropriate. See Lamborn v. Slack, 107 So. 2d 277 (Fla. 2d DCA 1958) (in which the court found a contract implied in fact but discussed the issue using quasi contractual principles). When properly raised in the pleadings, this overlapping of theories may require a fact finder to view the facts as they might apply to both. 3 Corbin on Contracts §561(1960).</p>
<p id="0346a9c8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Contrary to Commerce’s belief at trial, Equity was asserting a quasi contract claim against it, not a contract implied in fact.</p>

<p id="0346a9ca-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In [Maloney v. Therm Alum Industries Corp., 636 So. 2d 767 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1994)], this court considered the availability of a quasi contract theory to a construction subcontractor seeking recovery against an owner of property, where there had been no dealings between the owner and the subcontractor. Pursuant to a contract with the general contractor, the subcontractor in <i>Maloney</i> furnished glass walls, windows and doors for the construction of an office building. The subcontractor was not paid in full for its work. The general <span title="312" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-312">p. 312</span>contractor and subcontractor submitted their claims against each other to arbitration. In the circuit court action, the subcontractor sought to recover damages against the owner on a quasi contract theory. Id. at 768. Relying on two out-of-state cases, this court held that a subcontractor could maintain a quasi contract action against an owner, provided that it pled and proved two elements to establish that the enrichment of the owner was unjust — that the subcontractor had exhausted all remedies against the general contractor and still remained unpaid and that the owner had not given consideration to any person for the improvements furnished by the subcontractor. Id. at 769-70. We quoted the following passage from Paschall’s Inc. v. Dozier, 219 Tenn. 45, 407 S.W.2d 150, 155 (1966):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="0346a9cb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The most significant requirement for a recovery on quasi contract is that the enrichment to the defendant be unjust. Consequently, if the landowner has given any consideration to any person for the improvements, it would not be unjust for him to retain the benefit without paying the furnisher. Also, we think that before recovery can be had against the landowner on an unjust enrichment theory, the furnisher of the materials and labor must have exhausted his remedies against the person with whom he had contracted, and still has not received the reasonable value of his services.</p>

<p id="0346a9cc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Id. 636 So. 2d at 770. <i>Maloney</i> reversed the judgment for the contractor based upon quasi contract because the status of the subcontractor’s arbitration claim with the general contractor was not established at trial. Under these circumstances, we held that it was “premature and therefore improper to permit the subcontractor to pursue” a quasi contract claim against the owner. Id. at 769.</p>
<p id="0346a9cd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Gene B.

We held that an unjust enrichment cannot exist “where payment has been made for the benefit conferred.” The payment to which we referred was the owner’s payment to the general contractor on the construction contract. . . . </p>
<p id="0346a9ce-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is language in <i>Maloney</i> which can be read to suggest that we imposed a third limitation on the ability of a subcontractor to maintain a quasi contract claim against an owner. <i>Maloney</i> quotes two paragraphs from Construction and Design Law §8.8C.1(1989), which include the following sentence:</p>

Section 713.30, Florida Statutes (1995), provides that the construction lien part of Chapter 713 “shall be cumulative to other existing remedies.” The plain language of the statute does not supersede any remedies available to a party seeking payment. St. Regis Paper Co. v. Quality Pipeline, Inc., 469 So. 2d 820, 822-23 (Fla. 2d DCA 1985).

<p id="0346cfe8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, Equity did not prove at trial that Commerce had not made payment to any party for the benefits conferred on the property by Equity. This was not an affirmative defense, but an essential element of a quasi contract claim by a subcontractor against an owner. . . . Had Commerce moved for an involuntary dismissal on this ground, the motion should have been granted. Contrary to the trial court’s evidentiary ruling, Commerce’s attempt to prove that it had paid $64,097 directly to subcontractors for work on the building was relevant to issues in this case. What Commerce expended on this project was central to Equity’s cause of action. Commerce contended that these payments were for work covered under the construction contract for which the subcontractors had not been paid by the general contractor. If the $64,097 is added to the $256,894 [sic; $223,065.04?] that Commerce paid to the general contractor, then the total amount Commerce spent on the project exceeded the contract price for the improvements. As we have observed, where an owner has given consideration for the subcontractor’s work by paying out the contract price for the work, an unpaid subcontractor’s claim that the owner has been unjustly enriched must fail.</p>
<p id="0346cfe9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court’s reliance on <i>Zaleznik</i> was misplaced. In that case it was undisputed that the owner received over $70,000 in construction work for which it paid no one. What Commerce paid out on this project was not fully litigated below, so whether its “enrichment” was “unjust” is an open question.</p>
<p id="0346cfea-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judgment appealed is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the trial court to take additional evidence from the parties on whether Commerce made payment to or on behalf of its general contractor covering the benefits Equity conferred on the subject property.

Accord, Maintenance Enterp., LLC v. Orascom E &amp; C USA, Inc., 2016 WL 9450684 (S.D. Iowa). The principle of <i>Commerce Partnership</i> has also been extended to suits against a general contractor by a sub-subcontractor that has not been paid by the subcontractor. E.g., Hottinger Excav. &amp; Ready Mix, LLC, v. R.E. Crawford Constr., LLC, 2016 WL 9735771 (D. Colo.); C. Szabo Contracting, Inc. v. Lorig Constr. Co., 19 N.E.3d 638 (Ill. App. Ct. 2014). Not all courts accept the restitutionary principle applied in <i>Commerce Partnership,</i> however. E.g., Bennett Heating &amp; Air Conditioning, Inc. v. NationsBank of Maryland, 674 A.2d 534, 540-541 (Md. 1996). The question is discussed in detail and the various policy arguments pro and con are weighed in Doug Rendleman, Quantum Meruit for the Subcontractor: Has Restitution Jumped Off Dawson’s Dock? 79 Tex.

<li class=""><p id="0346f6ff-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Restitutionary liability of lessors.</i> Restitutionary claims have also been brought by contractors against lessors of property when the lessee has contracted but has not paid for improvements to the leased property. Courts have commonly denied recovery for such claims, on the ground that the owner has not been unjustly enriched, where there has been no showing that the owner needed or wanted the improvements contracted for by the tenant. E.g., Graves v. Berkowitz, 15 S.W.3d 59 (Mo. Ct. App. 2000) (not inequitable for defendant owner to retain benefit of construction work without paying for it; landlord knew of work but was only “passive beneficiary”); Puttkammer v. Minth, 266 N.W.2d 361 (Wis. 1978) (contractor does not state cause of action for unjust enrichment when complaint alleges only that owner knew that improvements were being made). Some courts, however, will allow restitutionary recovery if such a showing can be made. E.g., Idaho Lumber, Inc. v. Buck, 710 P.2d 647 (Idaho Ct. App. 1985) (contractor allowed to recover from landlord on restitutionary basis for remodeling work done for tenant). See generally 2 George E. Palmer, Law of Restitution §10.7, at 422-425 (1978).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0346f700-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The mechanic’s lien.</i> The statutory law of virtually every jurisdiction includes provisions for “mechanic’s liens.” A mechanic’s lien is a statutory encumbrance (as opposed to a contractual encumbrance like a mortgage) on <span title="315" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-315">p. 315</span>real property for the value of improvements made to the property by a laborer or supplier of materials pursuant to contract. Typically, the lien must be filed in the public records and suit must be brought to enforce the lien within a set period. Failure to meet these requirements results in loss of the lien. Owners of property on which improvements are being made (along with banks and other institutions that finance construction) typically protect themselves from mechanic’s liens by releasing funds only when all subcontractors have signed “lien waivers.” If an owner has released funds based on a lien waiver by a subcontractor, the subcontractor will almost certainly be unable to maintain a claim for restitution. See George M. Morris Construction Co. v. Four Seasons Motor Inn, Inc., 567 P.2d 965 (N.M. 1977) (lien waivers precluded action by laborers against owner who had made payments in reliance on waivers).</p></li>

<p id="03471e19-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff asked the circuit court to order an accounting of the defendant’s personal and business assets accumulated between June 1969 through December 1981 (the duration of the parties’ cohabitation) and to determine plaintiff’s share of this property. The circuit court’s dismissal of plaintiff’s amended complaint is the subject of this appeal. The plaintiff rests her claim for an accounting and a share in the accumulated property on the following legal theories: (1) she is entitled to an equitable division of property under sec. 767.255, Stats. 1985-86; (2) the defendant is estopped to assert as a defense to plaintiff’s claim under sec. 767.255, that the parties are not married; (3) the plaintiff is entitled to damages for defendant’s breach of an express contract or an implied-in-fact contract between the parties; (4) the defendant holds the accumulated property under a constructive trust based upon unjust enrichment; and (5) the plaintiff is entitled to partition of the parties’ real and personal <span title="316" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-316">p. 316</span>property pursuant to the partition statutes, secs. 820.01 and 842.02(1), 1985-86, and common law principles of partition.</p>
<p id="03471e1a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The circuit court dismissed the amended complaint, concluding that sec. 767.255, Stats. 1985-86, authorizing a court to divide property, does not apply to the division of property between unmarried persons. Without analyzing the four other legal theories upon which the plaintiff rests her claim, the circuit court simply concluded that the legislature, not the court, should provide relief to parties who have accumulated property in non-marital cohabitation relationships. The circuit court gave no further explanation for its decision.</p>
<p id="03471e1b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree with the circuit court that the legislature did not intend sec. 767.255 to apply to an unmarried couple. We disagree with the circuit court’s implicit conclusion that courts cannot or should not, without express authorization from the legislature, divide property between persons who have engaged in nonmarital cohabitation. Courts traditionally have settled contract and property disputes between unmarried persons, some of whom have cohabited. Nonmarital cohabitation does not render every agreement between the cohabiting parties illegal and does not automatically preclude one of the parties from seeking judicial relief, such as statutory or common law partition, damages for breach of express or implied contract, constructive trust and quantum meruit where the party alleges, and later proves, facts supporting the legal theory. The issue for the court in each case is whether the complaining party has set forth any legally cognizable claim. . . . </p>

<p id="03471e1e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff commenced this action in 1982. The plaintiff’s amended complaint alleges the following facts, which for purposes of this appeal must be accepted as true. The plaintiff and the defendant met in 1967, when she was 19 years old, was living with her parents and was working full time as a nurse’s aide in preparation for a nursing career. Shortly after the parties met, the defendant persuaded the plaintiff to move into an apartment paid for by him and to quit her job. According to the amended complaint, the defendant “indicated” to the plaintiff that he would provide for her.</p>
<p id="03471e1f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Early in 1969, the parties began living together in a “marriage-like” relationship, holding themselves out to the public as husband and wife. The plaintiff assumed the defendant’s surname as her own. Subsequently, she gave birth to two children who were also given the defendant’s surname. The parties filed joint income tax returns and maintained joint bank accounts asserting that they were husband and wife. The defendant insured the plaintiff as his wife on his medical insurance policy. He also took out a life insurance policy on her as his wife, naming himself as the beneficiary. The parties purchased real and personal property as husband and wife. The plaintiff executed documents and obligated herself on promissory notes to lending institutions as the defendant’s wife.</p>

Additionally, the plaintiff contributed personal property to the relationship which she owned at the beginning of the relationship or acquired through gifts or purchases during the relationship. She served as hostess for the defendant for social and business-related events. The amended complaint further asserts that periodically, between 1969 and 1975, the plaintiff cooked and cleaned for the defendant and his employees while his business, a landscaping service, was building and landscaping a golf course.</p>
<p id="03471e21-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From 1973 to 1976, the plaintiff worked 20-25 hours per week at the defendant’s office, performing duties as a receptionist, typist, and assistant bookkeeper. From 1976 to 1981, the plaintiff worked 40-60 hours per week at a business she started with the defendant’s sister-in-law, then continued and managed the business herself after the dissolution of that partnership. The plaintiff further alleges that in 1981 the defendant made their relationship so intolerable that she was forced to move from their home and their relationship was irretrievably broken. Subsequently, the defendant barred the plaintiff from returning to her business.</p>
<p id="03471e22-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff alleges that during the parties’ relationship, and because of her domestic and business contributions, the business and personal wealth of the couple increased. Furthermore, the plaintiff alleges that she never received any compensation for these contributions to the relationship and that the defendant indicated to the plaintiff both orally and through his conduct that he considered her to be his wife and that she would share equally in the increased wealth.</p>
<p id="03471e23-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff asserts that since the breakdown of the relationship the defendant has refused to share equally with her the wealth accumulated through their joint efforts or to compensate her in any way for her contributions to the relationship.</p>

<p id="03474535-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff’s first legal theory to support her claim against the property accumulated during the cohabitation is that the plaintiff, defendant, and their children constitute a “family,” thus entitling the plaintiff to bring an action for property division under sec. 767.02(1)(h), Stats. 1985-86, and to have the court “divide the property of the parties and divest and transfer the title of any such property” pursuant to sec. 767.255, 1985-86.</p>
<p id="03474536-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff asserts that the legislature intended secs. 767.02(1)(h) and 767.255, which usually govern division of property between married persons in divorce or legal separation proceedings, to govern a property division action between unmarried cohabitants who constitute a family. The plaintiff points out that secs. 767.02(1)(h) and 767.255 are part of chapter 767, which is entitled “Actions Affecting the Family,” and that in 1979 the legislature deliberately changed the title of the chapter from “Actions Affecting Marriage” to “Actions Affecting the Family.” The legislature has failed to provide any definition for “family” under ch. 767, or for that matter under any chapter of the Family Code.</p>

Warden, 36 Wash. App. 693, 676 P.2d 1037 (1984), to support her claim for relief under secs. 767.02(1)(h) and 767.255. In <i>Warden,</i> the Washington court of appeals held that the statute providing guidelines for property division upon dissolution of marriage, legal separation, etc., could also be applied to divide property acquired by unmarried cohabitants in what was “tantamount to a marital family except for a legal marriage.” <i>Warden,</i> 36 Wash. App. at 698, 676 P.2d at 1039. <i>Warden</i> is remarkably similar on its facts to the instant case. The parties in <i>Warden</i> had lived together for 11 years, had two children, held themselves out as husband and wife, acquired property together, and filed joint tax returns. On those facts, the Washington court of appeals held that the trial court correctly treated the parties as a “family” within the meaning of the Washington marriage dissolution statute. In addition, the trial court had considered such statutory factors as the length and purpose of the parties’ relationship, their two children, and the contributions and future prospects of each in determining their respective shares of the property.</p>
<p id="03474538-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the <i>Warden</i> case provides support for the plaintiff’s argument, most courts which have addressed the issue of whether marriage dissolution statutes provide relief to unmarried cohabitants have either rejected or avoided application of a marriage dissolution statute to unmarried cohabitants. See, e.g., Marvin v. Marvin, 18 Cal. 3d 660, 681, 134 Cal. Rptr. 815, 557 P.2d 106 (1976); Metten v. Benge, 366 N.W.2d 577, 579-80 (Iowa 1985); Glasgo v. Glasgo, 410 N.E.2d 1325, 1331 (Ind. Ct.

<p id="03474539-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The purpose of statutory construction is to ascertain the intent of the legislature and give effect to that intent.

<p id="0347453c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the legislature added what is now sec. 767.255 in 1977 as part of the no fault divorce bill, it stated that its “sole purpose” was “to promote an equitable and reasonable adjudication of the economic and custodial issues involved in <i>marriage</i> relationships.” (emphasis supplied) Moreover, the unambiguous language of sec. 767.255 and the criteria for property division listed in sec. 767.255 plainly contemplate that the parties who are governed by that section are or have been married. Finally, secs. 767.02(1)(h) and 767.255 were both in existence before the 1979 legislature changed the title of ch. 767 from “Marriage” to “Family.” A change in the title of the chapter would not change the import of these statutory provisions.</p>

The entire Family Code, of which ch. 767 is an integral part, is governed generally by the provisions of sec. 765.001(2), which states in part that “[i]t is the intent of chs. 765 to 768 to promote the stability and best interests of <i>marriage and the family. . . . Marriage</i> is the institution that <i>is the foundation of family and of society.</i> Its stability is basic to morality and civilization, and of vital interest to society and the state.” (emphasis supplied) Section 765.001(3) further states that “[c]hapters 765 to 768 shall be liberally construed to effect the objectives of sub. (2).” The conclusion is almost inescapable from this language in sec. 765.001(2)(3) that the legislature not only intended chs. 765-768 to protect and promote the “family,” but also intended “family” to be within the “marriage” context.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11246_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N11246_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">10</a></span></p>

<p id="03476c54-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the defendant has not discussed this legal theory, we conclude that the doctrine of “marriage by estoppel” should not be applied in this case. We reach this result primarily because we have already concluded that the legislature did not intend sec. 767.255 to govern property division between unmarried cohabitants. We do not think the parties’ conduct should place them within the ambit of a statute which the legislature did not intend to govern them.</p>

<p id="03476c56-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff’s third legal theory on which her claim rests is that she and the defendant had a contract to share equally the property accumulated during their relationship.

A contract will not be enforced, however, if it violates public policy. A declaration that the contract is against public policy should be made only after a careful balancing, in the light of all the circumstances, of the interest in enforcing a particular promise against the policy against enforcement. Courts should be reluctant to frustrate a party’s reasonable expectations without a corresponding benefit to be gained in deterring “misconduct” or avoiding inappropriate use of the judicial system. . . .; Restatement (Second) of Contracts Section 178 comments <i>b</i> and <i>e</i> (1981).</p>
<p id="03476c58-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant appears to attack the plaintiff’s contract theory on three grounds. First, the defendant apparently asserts that the court’s recognition of plaintiff’s contract claim for a share of the parties’ property contravenes the Wisconsin Family Code. Second, the defendant asserts that the legislature, not the courts, should determine the property and contract rights of unmarried cohabiting parties. Third, the defendant intimates that the parties’ relationship was immoral and illegal and that any recognition of a contract between the parties or plaintiff’s claim for a share of the property accumulated during the cohabitation contravenes public policy.</p>
<p id="03476c59-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant rests his argument that judicial recognition of a contract between unmarried cohabitants for property division violates the Wisconsin Family Code on Hewitt v. Hewitt, 77 Ill. 2d 49, 31 Ill. Dec. 827, 394 N.E.2d 1204, 3 A.L.R.4th 1 (1979). In <i>Hewitt</i> the Illinois Supreme Court concluded that judicial recognition of mutual property rights between unmarried cohabitants would violate the policy of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution Act because enhancing the attractiveness of a private arrangement contravenes the Act’s policy of strengthening and preserving the integrity of marriage. The Illinois court concluded that allowing such a contract claim would weaken the sanctity of marriage, put in doubt the rights of inheritance, and open the door to false pretenses of marriage. <i>Hewitt,</i> 77 Ill. 2d at 65, 31 Ill. Dec. at 834, 394 N.E.2d at 1211.</p>
<p id="03476c5a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree with Professor Prince and other commentators that the <i>Hewitt</i> court made an unsupportable inferential leap when it found that cohabitation agreements run contrary to statutory policy and that the <i>Hewitt</i> court’s approach is patently inconsistent with the principle that public policy limits are to be narrowly and exactly applied.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11296_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N11296_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">14</a></span></p>
<p id="03476c5c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Furthermore, the Illinois statutes upon which the Illinois supreme court rested its decision are distinguishable from the Wisconsin statutes. The Illinois supreme court relied on the fact that Illinois still retained “fault” divorce and that cohabitation was unlawful. By contrast, Wisconsin abolished “fault” in divorce in 1977 and abolished criminal sanctions for nonmarital cohabitation in 1983.</p>
<p id="0347936d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="321" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-321">p. 321</span>The defendant has failed to persuade this court that enforcing an express or implied in fact contract between these parties would in fact violate the Wisconsin Family Code. The Family Code, chs. 765-68, Stats. 1985-86, is intended to promote the institution of marriage and the family. We find no indication, however, that the Wisconsin legislature intended the Family Code to restrict in any way a court’s resolution of property or contract disputes between unmarried cohabitants.</p>
<p id="0347936e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant also urges that if the court is not willing to say that the Family Code proscribes contracts between unmarried cohabiting parties, then the court should refuse to resolve the contract and property rights of unmarried cohabitants without legislative guidance. The defendant asserts that this court should conclude, as the <i>Hewitt</i> court did, that the task of determining the rights of cohabiting parties is too complex and difficult for the court and should be left to the legislature. We are not persuaded by the defendant’s argument. Courts have traditionally developed principles of contract and property law through the case-by-case method of the common law. While ultimately the legislature may resolve the problems raised by unmarried cohabiting parties, we are not persuaded that the court should refrain from resolving such disputes until the legislature gives us direction. Our survey of the cases in other jurisdictions reveals that <i>Hewitt</i> is not widely followed.</p>
<p id="0347936f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We turn to the defendant’s third point, namely, that any contract between the parties regarding property division contravenes public policy because the contract is based on immoral or illegal sexual activity. . . . [A]t oral argument defendant’s attorney indicated that he did not find this argument persuasive in light of the current community mores, the substantial number of unmarried people who cohabit, and the legislature’s abolition of criminal sanctions for cohabitation. . . . Because illegal sexual activity has posed a problem for courts in contract actions, we discuss this issue even though the defendant did not emphasize it.</p>
<p id="03479370-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts have generally refused to enforce contracts for which the sole consideration is sexual relations, sometimes referred to as “meretricious” relationships.

<p id="0347ba8b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff’s fourth theory of recovery involves unjust enrichment. Essentially, she alleges that the defendant accepted and retained the benefit of services she provided knowing that she expected to share equally in the wealth accumulated during their relationship. She argues that it is unfair for the defendant to retain all the assets they accumulated under these circumstances and that a constructive trust should be imposed on the property as a result of the defendant’s unjust enrichment. In his brief, the defendant does not attack specifically either the legal theory or the factual allegations made by the plaintiff.</p>
<p id="0347ba8c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unlike claims for breach of an express or implied in fact contract, a claim of unjust enrichment does not arise out of an agreement entered into by the parties. Rather, an action for recovery based upon unjust enrichment is grounded on the moral principle that one who has received a benefit has a duty to make restitution where retaining such a benefit would be unjust. Puttkammer v. Minth, 83 Wis. 2d 686, 689, 266 N.W.2d 361, 363 (1978).</p>
<p id="0347ba8d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because no express or implied in fact agreement exists between the parties, recovery based upon unjust enrichment is sometimes referred to as “quasi contract,” or contract “implied in law” rather than “implied in fact.” Quasi contracts are obligations created by law to prevent injustice. Shulse v. City of Mayville, 223 Wis. 624, 632, 271 N.W. 643 (1937).</p>
<p id="0347ba8e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Wisconsin, an action for unjust enrichment, or quasi contract, is based upon proof of three elements: (1) a benefit conferred on the defendant by the plaintiff, (2) appreciation or knowledge by the defendant of the benefit, and (3) acceptance or retention of the benefit by the defendant under circumstances making it inequitable for the defendant to retain the benefit. <i>Puttkammer,</i> supra, 83 Wis. 2d at 689, 266 N.W.2d 361; Wis.

<p id="0347ba8f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff has cited no cases directly supporting actions in unjust enrichment by unmarried cohabitants, and the defendant provides no authority against it. . . . </p>
<p id="0347ba90-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Steffes</i> case, however, does provide . . . support for the plaintiff’s position. Although <i>Steffes</i> involved a claim for recovery in contract by an unmarried cohabitant for the value of services she performed for the decedent, the same equitable principles that governed that case would appear to apply in a case <span title="324" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-324">p. 324</span>where the plaintiff is seeking recovery based upon unjust enrichment. In <i>Steffes,</i> the court cited with approval a statement by the trial judge that “[t]he question I have in mind is why should the estate be enriched when that man was just as much a part of the illicit relationship as she was and not let her have her fair dues. I don’t understand that law that would interpret unjust enrichment that way and deprive one and let the other benefit and do it on the basis that there was an illicit relationship but not equally held against the both. . . .” <i>Steffes,</i> supra, 95 Wis. 2d at 508, 290 N.W.2d 697.</p>
<p id="0347ba91-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As part of his general argument, the defendant claims that the court should leave the parties to an illicit relationship such as the one in this case essentially as they are found, providing no relief at all to either party. For support, the defendant relies heavily on Hewitt v. Hewitt, supra, and the dissent in <i>Steffes,</i> to argue that courts should provide no relief whatsoever to unmarried cohabitants until the legislature provides specifically for it. See <i>Steffes,</i> supra, 95 Wis. 2d at 521-22, 290 N.W.2d 697 (Coffey, J., dissenting).</p>
<p id="0347ba92-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As we have discussed previously, allowing no relief at all to one party in a so-called “illicit” relationship effectively provides total relief to the other, by leaving that party owner of all the assets acquired through the efforts of both. Yet it cannot seriously be argued that the party retaining all the assets is less “guilty” than the other. Such a result is contrary to the principles of equity. Many courts have held, and we now so hold, that unmarried cohabitants may raise claims based upon unjust enrichment following the termination of their relationships where one of the parties attempts to retain an unreasonable amount of the property acquired through the efforts of both.</p>
<p id="0347ba93-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, the plaintiff alleges that she contributed both property and services to the parties’ relationship. She claims that because of these contributions the parties’ assets increased, but that she was never compensated for her contributions. She further alleges that the defendant, knowing that the plaintiff expected to share in the property accumulated, “accepted the services rendered to him by the plaintiff” and that it would be unfair under the circumstances to allow him to retain everything while she receives nothing. We conclude that the facts alleged are sufficient to state a claim for recovery based upon unjust enrichment. . . . </p>

If parties are legally married, either by a “ceremonial” marriage, or by a “common law” marriage (recognized in a minority of jurisdictions), and subsequently separate or divorce, the spouse who sacrificed income while rendering services to the other may obtain court-ordered awards of support or alimony. In addition, in many jurisdictions courts have the power to order an equitable division of marital assets. Beginning with the leading case of Marvin v. Marvin, 557 P.2d 106 (Cal. 1976) (en banc), a substantial majority of jurisdictions has allowed a party to a nonmarital relationship who makes substantial contributions to the other party to obtain some form of recovery from the other. Such courts have relied on a number of legal theories, including express contract, implied-in-fact contract, and restitution based on unjust enrichment. The court in <i>Marvin</i> indicated that the opinion did “not preclude the evolution of additional equitable remedies to protect the expectations of the parties to a nonmarital relationship in cases in which existing remedies prove inadequate. . . .” Id. at 123 n.25. Since its rendition nearly 40 years ago, the <i>Marvin</i> case has become the seminal and generally accepted authority for the allowance of claims between unmarried cohabiting partners. See generally Alexander C. Morey &amp; Dixie Grossman, Property Rights of Unmarried Cohabitants — Nothing New under the Sun, 25 J. Am. Acad. Matrim. Law. 87, 88, 100 (2015) (“Although the world has vastly changed since 1976 . . . <i>Marvin</i> and its progeny remain the standard-bearers”). Types of claims sustainable under the general umbrella of <i>Marvin</i> include quantum meruit, express contract, contract implied-in-fact and implied-in-law, constructive trust, joint venture and partition. Id. See, e.g., In re Estate of Mousel, 869 N.W.2d 169 (Wis. Ct. App. 2015) (court could apply promissory estoppel against estate of claimant’s deceased partner to give her the financial equivalent of half-ownership of joint domicile; <i>Watts</i> decision cited and relied on as authorizing generally the maintenance of property claims between unmarried cohabitants).</p>
<p id="0347e1ad-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts in a few states, however, have continued to find contracts between unmarried cohabitants unenforceable. For example, Hewitt v. Hewitt, 394 <span title="326" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-326">p. 326</span>N.E.2d 1204 (Ill. 1979), discussed by the court in <i>Watts,</i> denied recovery to a plaintiff who had lived with the defendant for 15 years in a nonmarital relationship to which three children were born. Despite vigorous arguments based both on intervening changes in Illinois statutory law and on the virtually unanimous opinions of other courts faced with similar cases, the rule of the <i>Hewitt</i> case was recently affirmed by the Illinois Supreme Court. Blumenthal v. Brewer, 69 N.E.3d 834 (Ill. 2016).</p>

<li class=""><p id="034808c2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Measure of recovery.</i> Assuming that a court recognizes a right to quantum meruit recovery on behalf of a cohabitant, how is such recovery to be measured? On trial following remand in <i>Watts,</i> a jury awarded the plaintiff $113,000 on her unjust enrichment claim. The evidence showed that the defendant’s net worth had increased by $1,113,900.88, during the 11 years the parties cohabited, so the jury’s award amounted to about 10 percent of the defendant’s increase in net worth. The Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed. 448 N.W.2d 292 (Wis. Ct. App. 1989). By contrast, in Waage v. Borer, 525 N.W.2d 96 (Wis. Ct. App. 1994), the court distinguished <i>Watts</i> and held that uncompensated services rendered during a cohabitation period of eight years were not sufficient to establish a claim for unjust enrichment because the claimant had failed to show that the defendant’s wealth had been increased during the period of cohabitation. The court also ruled that the claimant’s forgone employment opportunities were not relevant to her unjust enrichment claim. Accord, Sands v. Menard, 904 N.W.2d 789 (Wis. 2017) (two justices dissenting).</p>
<p id="034808c3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the Wisconsin courts appear to focus on the increase in the defendant’s net worth in measuring quantum meruit recovery in claims between cohabitants, courts in other jurisdictions will not necessarily agree, particularly in cases in which the increase in the defendant’s wealth has been substantial. For example, in Maglica v. Maglica, 78 Cal. Rptr. 2d 101 (Ct. App. 1998), the California Court of Appeals reversed a jury verdict awarding one cohabitant $84 million on a quantum meruit theory. The court ruled that the trial judge had committed reversible error by instructing the jury to measure recovery by the amount by which the defendant had benefited from the plaintiff’s services. The court held that the proper measure of recovery was the reasonable value of the plaintiff’s services. See also Comment <i>e</i> of the Restatement (Third) of Restitution §28, which adopts the approach of <i>Maglica</i> with regard to the measure of recovery.</p>

<li class=""><p id="034808c4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Intra-family claims.</i> Another common family situation in which restitutionary claims have been asserted involves cases in which one family member has cared for an aged parent or relative and then asserts a restitutionary claim against the estate of the deceased parent or relative. The effect of allowing such claims is to enable the family member asserting the claim to obtain a larger share of the estate than would otherwise be received under either the deceased person’s will or the state’s intestacy law (if no will is involved). Underlying such claims may be family tensions resulting from feelings that the family member providing services has made a personal sacrifice while the others (often siblings of the claimant) have not done their fair share in caring for the aged parent. The general rule followed in deciding such claims is that services rendered by family members to each other are presumed to be gratuitous, while services rendered between individuals who are not members of the same family are presumed to be for compensation. Whether the parties are part of the same family depends on the facts and circumstances rather than simply kinship. Consider, for example, Adams v. Underwood, 470 S.W.2d 180 (Tenn. 1971), where the Tennessee Supreme Court stated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="034808c5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">where, as in this case, an adult or emancipated child, by pre-arrangement with a parent, gives up an established home and moves into the home of the parent, not for the purposes of reestablishing a family relationship, but for the purpose of rendering services of an extraordinarily burdensome nature, over a long period of time, the presumption of gratuity need not apply.</p>
</div>
<p id="034808c6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Id. at 186. See also In re Estate of Bush (Fuller v. Terrell), 908 S.W.2d 809 (Mo. 1995) (plaintiff allowed to recover for services rendered to sister-in-law without having to overcome presumption that services were rendered gratuitously).</p>
<p id="034808c7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if the presumption that the services were rendered gratuitously applies, the presumption can be overcome, but courts differ on what the party seeking recovery must establish. See In re Grossman’s Estate, 27 N.W.2d 365 (Wis. 1947) (presumption overcome when adult daughter left her home three times for extended periods to move 100 miles to care for ailing parents). Other courts may require a stronger showing to allow recovery between family members. Some courts demand proof by “clear and convincing evidence,” a standard that is more demanding than the normal civil standard of the “preponderance of the evidence.” Harrison v. Harrison, 75 So. 2d 620 (Ala. 1954). Which approach would you favor? Why? What factors should a court take into account in deciding whether to allow such a restitutionary claim?</p></li>

This is a defect inherent in all human systems of legislation. This rule that a mere verbal promise, without any consideration, cannot be enforced by action, is universal in its application, and cannot be departed from to suit particular cases in which a refusal to perform such a promise may be disgraceful.</p>
<p id="03482fe3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The promise declared on in this case appears to have been made without any legal consideration. The kindness and services towards the sick son of the defendant were not bestowed at his request. The son was in no respect under the care of the defendant. He was twenty-five years old, and had long left his father’s family. On his return from a foreign country, he fell sick among strangers, and the plaintiff acted the part of the good Samaritan, giving him shelter and comfort until he died. The defendant, his father, on being informed of this event, influenced by a transient feeling of gratitude, promises in writing to pay the plaintiff for the expenses he had incurred. But he has determined to <span title="329" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-329">p. 329</span>break this promise, and is willing to have his case appear on record as a strong example of particular injustice sometimes necessarily resulting from the operation of general rules.</p>
<p id="03482fe4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is said a moral obligation is a sufficient consideration to support an express promise; and some authorities lay down the rule thus broadly; but upon examination of the cases we are satisfied that the universality of the rule cannot be supported, and that there must have been some preexisting obligation, which has become inoperative by positive law, to form a basis for an effective promise. The cases of debts barred by the statute of limitations, of debts incurred by infants, of debts of bankrupts, are generally put for illustration of the rule. Express promises founded on such preexisting equitable obligations may be enforced; there is a good consideration for them; they merely remove an impediment created by law to the recovery of debts honestly due, but which public policy protects the debtors from being compelled to pay. In all these cases there was originally a quid pro quo; and according to the principles of natural justice the party receiving ought to pay; but the legislature has said he shall not be coerced; then comes the promise to pay the debt that is barred, the promise of the man to pay the debt of the infant, of the discharged bankrupt to restore to his creditor what by the law he had lost. In all these cases there is a moral obligation founded upon an antecedent valuable consideration. These promises therefore have a sound legal basis. They are not promises to pay something for nothing; not naked pacts; but the voluntary revival or creation of obligation which before existed in natural law, but which had been dispensed with, not for the benefit of the party obliged solely, but principally for the public convenience. If moral obligation, in its fullest sense, is a good substratum for an express promise, it is not easy to perceive why it is not equally good to support an implied promise. What a man ought to do, generally he ought to be made to do, whether he promise or refuse. But the law of society has left most of such obligations to the <i>interior</i> forum, as the tribunal of conscience has been aptly called. Is there not a moral obligation upon every son who has become affluent by means of the education and advantages bestowed upon him by his father, to relieve that father from pecuniary embarrassment, to promote his comfort and happiness, and even to share with him his riches, if thereby he will be made happy? And yet such a son may, with impunity, leave such a father in any degree of penury above that which will expose the community in which he dwells, to the danger of being obliged to preserve him from absolute want. Is not a wealthy father under strong moral obligation to advance the interest of an obedient, well disposed son, to furnish him with the means of acquiring and maintaining a becoming rank in life, to rescue him from the horrors of debt incurred by misfortune? Yet the law will uphold him in any degree of parsimony, short of that which would reduce his son to the necessity of seeking public charity.</p>
<p id="03482fe5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Without doubt there are great interests of society which justify withholding the coercive arm of the law from these duties of imperfect obligation, as they are called; imperfect, not because they are less binding upon the conscience <span title="330" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-330">p. 330</span>than those which are called perfect, but because the wisdom of the social law does not impose sanctions upon them.</p>
<p id="03482fe6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A deliberate promise, in writing, made freely and without any mistake, one which may lead the party to whom it is made into contracts and expenses, cannot be broken without a violation of moral duty. But if there was nothing paid or promised for it, the law, perhaps wisely, leaves the execution of it to the conscience of him who makes it. It is only when the party making the promise gains something, or he to whom it is made loses something, that the law gives the promise validity. And in the case of the promise of the adult to pay the debt of the infant, of the debtor discharged by the statute of limitations or bankruptcy, the principle is preserved by looking back to the origin of the transaction, where an equivalent is to be found. An exact equivalent is not required by the law; for there being a consideration, the parties are left to estimate its value: though here the courts of equity will step in to relieve from gross inadequacy between the consideration and the promise.</p>
<p id="03482fe7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These principles are deduced from the general current of decided cases upon the subject, as well as from the known maxims of the common law. The general position, that moral obligation is a sufficient consideration for an express promise, is to be limited in its application, to cases where at some time or other a good or valuable consideration has existed.</p>
<p id="03482fe8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A legal obligation is always a sufficient consideration to support either an express or an implied promise; such as an infant’s debt for necessaries, or a father’s promise to pay for the support and education of his minor children. But when the child shall have attained to manhood, and shall have become his own agent in the world’s business, the debts he incurs, whatever may be their nature, create no obligation upon the father; and it seems to follow, that his promise founded upon such a debt has no legally binding force.</p>

But it is a sufficient answer to this position, that such legal obligation does not exist except in the very cases provided for in the statute, and never until the party charged has been adjudged to be of sufficient ability thereto. We do not know from the report any of the facts which are necessary to create such an obligation. Whether the deceased had a legal settlement in this commonwealth at the time of his death, whether he was likely to become chargeable had he lived, whether the defendant was of sufficient ability, are essential facts to be adjudicated by the court <span title="331" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-331">p. 331</span>to which is given jurisdiction on this subject.

Would the result have been different? Suppose instead that Levi Wyman was a 16-year-old boy, living at home with his parents, when he became ill while on a short trip away from home. Would the result have been different? On the latter assumed facts, would it have mattered whether the father had written the letter of February 24, promising to pay for his son’s care?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03482fef-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Moral obligation.</i> Cases like Mills v. Wyman are often referred to as involving enforcement of a “moral obligation.” It is useful, however, to refine this point. The court in <i>Mills</i> clearly holds that the law will not necessarily enforce every promise, regardless of the morality of failing to honor a promise seriously made. In stating the general rule, the court notes that “there are great interests of society which justify withholding the coercive arm of the law from these duties of imperfect obligation.” What interests do you suppose the court had in mind? Charles Fried, a noted philosopher and contract scholar, argues that this view is wrong and that the law should follow morality, enforcing a promise seriously made. Recall the material following the <i>Plowman</i> case in Chapter 2.</p>
<p id="03482ff0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court in <i>Mills</i> also declares that a moral obligation can give rise to a legal obligation in certain specific situations: If a person was subject to a legal obligation that has become unenforceable (either because of passage of time, such as the statute of limitations, or for some other reason), a subsequent promise to honor or revive the legal obligation will be enforceable at law. Is it accurate to characterize this liability as being based on “moral obligation”?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03482ff1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Debts barred by time.</i> The court states that promises to pay debts barred by the statute of limitations are enforceable because the debt is a preexisting legal obligation. A modern statement of this rule can be found in Restatement (Second) §82. A promise to pay a debt barred by the statute of limitations can be express or it may be implied from the conduct of the obligor. Id. §82(2). Today, in most jurisdictions, statutes regulate the enforceability of promises to pay debts barred by the statute of limitations. Such statutes often define the type of conduct that constitutes an implied promise to pay the debt. See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. §15-3-120 (part payment of principal or interest equivalent of written promise).</p>

<li class=""><p id="03482ff2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Debts discharged in bankruptcy.</i> Promises to pay debts previously discharged in bankruptcy are also legally enforceable. Restatement (Second) §83. Unlike promises to pay debts barred by the statute of limitations, promises to pay debts discharged in bankruptcy will not be judicially implied. Restatement (Second) §83 provides that the promise must be “express.” Can this difference in treatment be justified? Consider the following comment from the Restatement: “In modern times discharge in bankruptcy has been thought to reflect a somewhat stronger public policy than the statute of limitations, and a promise implied from acknowledgment or part payment does not revive a debt discharged in bankruptcy.” Restatement (Second) §83 Comment <i>a.</i></p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03485703-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Statutory restrictions on promises to revive debt.</i> Some states have enacted statutes requiring promises to revive debts barred by the statute of limitations or bankruptcy to be in writing. See, e.g., N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law §5-701(a)(5) (promise to pay debt discharged in bankruptcy), §17-101 (promise to pay debt barred by statute of limitations). Sections §524(c), (d) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code impose a number of limitations on the ability of debtors to reassume by agreement debts discharged in bankruptcy.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03485704-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Obligations of minors.</i> The court in <i>Mills</i> also refers to “debts incurred by infants” as a situation in which the law will enforce a promise for benefits previously received. The court’s statement requires some elaboration. Contracts made by a minor prior to the time the minor reaches the legal age of majority (now 18) are unenforceable unless they are for “necessaries,” goods and services needed by the minor. After reaching the age of majority a minor becomes legally liable on any contracts made during minority that the minor elects to “affirm.” A minor may affirm a contract either expressly or by failure to “disaffirm” the contract within a reasonable time after reaching the age of majority. We will return in Chapter 7 to the subject of minors’ capacity to contract.</p></li>

<p id="03485706-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A close reading of the historical record reveals a starkly different version of the facts of Mills v.

Thus the court rightly absolved Seth Wyman, but for the wrong reasons. . . . [O]ther records from the period, including evidence of Seth Wyman’s considerable wealth, . . . raise new questions about the motivations of the parties.</p>

In his article Professor Watson goes beyond historical research to propose reform of the moral obligation doctrine. Finding the various explanations of the doctrine unpersuasive, he argues that promises made with an intention to be bound should be enforceable because such a rule would increase “allocational efficiency” and would link “legal liability more closely to moral responsibility.” Id. at 1805.</p></li>

Smith Lumber Company, a corporation, and acting within the scope of his employment, was engaged in clearing the upper floor of mill No. 2 of the company. While so engaged he was in the act of dropping a pine block from the upper floor of the mill to the ground below; this being the usual and ordinary way of clearing the floor, and it being the duty of the plaintiff in the course of his employment to so drop it. The block weighed about 75 pounds.</p>
<p id="03485711-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As appellant was in the act of dropping the block to the ground below, he was on the edge of the upper floor of the mill. As he started to turn the block loose so that it would drop to the ground, he saw J. Greeley McGowin, testator of the defendants, on the ground below and directly under where the block would have fallen had appellant turned it loose. Had he turned it loose it would have struck McGowin with such force as to have caused him serious bodily harm or death. Appellant could have remained safely on the upper floor of the mill by turning the block loose and allowing it to drop, but had he done this the block would have fallen on McGowin and caused him serious injuries or death. The only safe and reasonable way to prevent this was for appellant to hold to the block and divert its direction in falling from the place where McGowin was standing and the only safe way to divert it so as to prevent its coming into contact with McGowin was for appellant to fall with it to the ground below. Appellant did this, and by holding to the block and falling with it to the ground below, he diverted the course of its fall in such a way that McGowin was not injured. In thus preventing the injuries to McGowin appellant himself received serious bodily injuries, resulting in his right leg being broken, the heel of his right foot torn off and his right arm broken. He was badly crippled for life and rendered unable to do physical or mental labor.</p>

Under the agreement McGowin paid or caused to be paid to appellant the sum so agreed on up until McGowin’s death on January 1, 1934. After his death the payments were continued to and including January 27, 1934, at which time they were discontinued.

<p id="03487e28-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The action was for the unpaid installments accruing after January 27, 1934, to the time of the suit.</p>
<p id="03487e29-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The principal grounds of demurrer to the original and amended complaint are: (1) It states no cause of action; (2) its averments show the contract was without consideration; (3) it fails to allege that McGowin had, at or before the services were rendered, agreed to pay appellant for them; (4) the contract declared on is void under the statute of frauds.</p>
<p id="03487e2a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">1. The averments of the complaint show that appellant saved McGowin from death or grievous bodily harm. This was a material benefit to him of infinitely more value than any financial aid he could have received. Receiving this benefit, McGowin became morally bound to compensate appellant for the services rendered. Recognizing his moral obligation, he expressly agreed to pay appellant as alleged in the complaint and complied with this agreement up to the time of his death; a period of more than 8 years.</p>
<p id="03487e2b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Had McGowin been accidentally poisoned and a physician, without his knowledge or request, had administered an antidote, thus saving his life, a subsequent promise by McGowin to pay the physician would have been valid.

<p id="03487e2c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where the promisee cares for, improves, and preserves the property of the promisor, though done without his request, it is sufficient consideration for the promisor’s subsequent agreement to pay for the service, because of the material benefit received. . . . </p>
<p id="03487e2d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Boothe v. Fitzpatrick, 36 Vt. 681, the court held that a promise by defendant to pay for the past keeping of a bull which had escaped from defendant’s <span title="335" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-335">p. 335</span>premises and been cared for by plaintiff was valid, although there was no previous request, because the subsequent promise obviated that objection; it being equivalent to a previous request. On the same principle, had the promisee saved the promisor’s life or his body from grievous harm, his subsequent promise to pay for the services rendered would have been valid. Such service would have been far more material than caring for his bull. Any holding that saving a man from death or grievous bodily harm is not a material benefit sufficient to uphold a subsequent promise to pay for the service, necessarily rests on the assumption that saving life and preservation of the body from harm have only a sentimental value. The converse of this is true. Life and preservation of the body have material, pecuniary values, measurable in dollars and cents. Because of this, physicians practice their profession charging for services rendered in saving life and curing the body of its ills, and surgeons perform operations. The same is true as to the law of negligence, authorizing the assessment of damages in personal injury cases based upon the extent of the injuries, earnings, and life expectancies of those injured.</p>

It is well settled that a moral obligation is a sufficient consideration to support a subsequent promise to pay where the promisor has received a material benefit, although there was no original duty or liability resting on the promisor. . . . State ex rel. Bayer v. Funk, 105 Or. 134, 199 P. 592, 209 P. 113, 25 A.L.R. 625, 634. . . . In the case of State ex rel. Bayer v. Funk, supra, the court held that a moral obligation is a sufficient consideration to support an executory promise where the promisor has received an actual pecuniary or material benefit for which he subsequently expressly promised to pay.</p>
<p id="03487e31-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case at bar is clearly distinguishable from that class of cases where the consideration is a mere moral obligation or conscientious duty unconnected with receipt by promisor of benefits of a material or pecuniary nature. . . . Here the promisor received a material benefit constituting a valid consideration for his promise.</p>
<p id="03487e32-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">3. Some authorities hold that, for a moral obligation to support a subsequent promise to pay, there must have existed a prior legal or equitable obligation, which for some reason had become unenforceable, but for which the promisor was still morally bound. This rule, however, is subject to qualification in those cases where the promisor, having received a material benefit from the promisee, is morally bound to compensate him for the services rendered and in consideration of this obligation promises to pay. In such cases the subsequent promise to pay is an affirmance or ratification of the services rendered carrying with it the presumption that a previous request for the service was made. . . . </p>

The averments of the complaint show that in saving McGowin from death or grievous bodily harm, appellant was crippled for life. This was part of the consideration of the contract declared on. McGowin was benefited. Appellant was injured. Benefit to the promisor or injury to the promisee is a sufficient legal consideration for the promisor’s agreement to pay. Fisher v. Bartlett, 8 Greenl. (Me.) 122, 22 Am. Dec. 225; State ex rel. Bayer v. Funk, supra.</p>

<li class=""><p id="0348a54d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Promissory restitution principle.</i> The above case is often cited as an example of the “material benefit” rule, which holds that if a person receives a material benefit from another, other than gratuitously, a subsequent promise to compensate the person for rendering such benefit is enforceable. For further discussion of the background of Webb v. McGowin, see Richard Danzig &amp; Geoffrey Watson, The Capability Problem in Contract Law: Further Readings on Well-Known Cases ch. V (2d ed. 2004). Restatement (Second) §86 adopts the material benefit rule. Professor Stanley Henderson has referred to §86 as “promissory restitution.” Stanley D. Henderson, Promises Grounded in the Past: The Idea of Unjust Enrichment and the Law of Contracts, 57 Va. L. Rev. 1115, 1118 (1971). Is this a proper characterization of the section? If the receipt of material benefit alone is not enough to give rise to a right of recovery, why does the additional fact of the subsequent promise justify imposing an obligation?</p>
<span title="337" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-337">p. 337</span>
<p id="0348a54e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Note that promissory restitution cases can be seen as occupying a middle ground between classical contracts and the pure restitution cases discussed in the previous section of this chapter. The promissory restitution cases bear a similarity to classical contract because the obligation rests on the assent of the person subject to liability. On the other hand, the promissory restitution cases involve liability even though no bargained-for exchange has occurred. In addition, as discussed in Note 2 below, the measure of recovery is based on restitutionary principles. For an examination of the application of §86 see Clay B. Tousey III, Exceptional Circumstances: The Material Benefit Rule in Practice and Theory, 28 Campbell L. Rev. 153 (2006). See also Kevin M. Teeven, Moral Obligation Promise for Harm Caused, 39 Gonz. L. Rev. 349 (2004).</p>
<p id="0348a54f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not all courts agree with the material benefit rule. In Harrington v. Taylor, 36 S.E.2d 227 (N.C. 1945), a wife after being assaulted by her husband took refuge in the plaintiff’s house. The next day the husband gained entry to the plaintiff’s house. In the ensuing struggle, the wife knocked her husband down and was about to strike him with an ax when the plaintiff intervened and was struck by the ax, receiving a severely mutilated hand, but saving the husband’s life. Subsequently, the husband orally promised to pay the plaintiff for her damages. When the husband later refused to honor the promise, the plaintiff brought suit. The North Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the lower court’s decision to sustain the demurrer to the complaint. The court stated that “however much the defendant should be impelled by common gratitude to alleviate the plaintiff’s misfortune, a humanitarian act of this kind, voluntarily performed, is not such consideration as would entitle her to recover at law.” Id. at 227. For further discussion of Harrington v. Taylor, see Richard Danzig &amp; Geoffrey Watson, The Capability Problem in Contract Law: Further Readings on Well-Known Cases ch. VI (2d ed. 2004). Are <i>Webb</i> and <i>Harrington</i> in direct conflict or can the two cases be reconciled?</p></li>

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="0348cc68-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By virtue of the policy of enforcing bargains, the enrichment of one party as a result of an unequal exchange is not regarded as unjust, and this Section has no application to a promise to pay or perform more or to accept less than is called for by a pre-existing bargain between the same parties.</p>

<li class=""><p id="0348cc6c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>“Chestnut” cases.</i> The <i>Webb</i> case is a favorite of casebook editors, and has been for years. An online search will quickly reveal, however, that court decisions actually citing and relying on the <i>Webb</i> case are few and far between. When periodically revising and updating their casebooks, the editors of these and other collections of contracts materials must face the decision whether to drop or retain cases like this one: old “chestnuts” familiar to generation after generation of law students. These are cases that are remembered more for their facts — often odd, sometimes funny, always in some sense “memorable” — than for their legal content. Another contracts casebook author, Professor Carol Chomsky, addresses this issue with particular attention to <i>Webb</i>:</p>
<span title="339" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-339">p. 339</span>

<p id="0348cc6d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I’m . . . old-school enough to still believe that to be good lawyers and good public citizens, students need to understand more generally how the law works (or sometimes does not) and how it evolves, and that means teaching them something of the history of settled doctrine and even some obscure corners of the law. For example, one of the doctrines traditionally included in contracts casebooks is enforcement of promises made for benefit received, memorialized in Restatement (Second) of Contracts section 86. Looking for cases to update the presentation of that issue . . . I found virtually none addressing this issue, under the Restatement or otherwise, since the old classic opinions that appear in most of the casebooks (<i>Mills v. Wyman</i> and <i>Webb v. McGowin</i>). Lawyers do not need to know this doctrine in order to practice contract law; it rarely, if ever, comes up as a mechanism for enforcement in the “real world” of contracts, and certainly not in drafting contracts, because the doctrine fills a gap that exists precisely when there is no agreement, express or implied. We could have decided to remove the topic from the book and therefore the course. But the development and application of the rule in Restatement (Second) of Contracts section 86 is nonetheless a worthwhile story about how judges worked their way to a solution when faced with circumstances that seemed to warrant a remedy, but existing doctrine did not produce one. Considering how and why judges decide that such a development is necessary, how they move the law forward (or sideways), whether the newly crafted rule is a good one, and even why the rule is rarely or maybe never invoked — that is a worthwhile conversation.</p>

Obviously the editors of these materials once more opted (like Professor Chomsky) to retain <i>Webb</i> as a principal case, despite these qualms. Did reading the opinions in <i>Webb</i> help you understand the judicial process better? Consider and contrast the majority opinion written by Judge Bricken and Judge Samford’s concurrence. Would the case have been satisfactorily decided by either of those opinions alone? Further discussion of <i>Webb</i> and other “chestnut” cases can be found in Charles L. Knapp, Cases and Controversies: Some Things to Do with Contracts Cases, 88 Wash. L. Rev. 1337, 1359-1360 (2013).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0348cc6f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Recovery in the absence of a promise.</i> Suppose McGowin had <i>not promised</i> to care for Webb. Could he have still been held liable to Webb on pure restitutionary principles? Recall the <i>Pelo</i> case and its discussion of Restatement (First) of Restitution §116. The difficulty facing Webb in such an action would be having to show that the services were not rendered gratuitously (i.e., were rendered with an “intent to charge” under Restatement §116). In cases involving professional providers of services, modern courts have been willing to find an intent to charge and have allowed recovery for the reasonable value of the services rendered. The courts have refused, however, to allow recovery by nonprofessionals even for out-of-pocket losses involved in rescues. In a similar vein, Section 20 of the Restatement (Third) of Restitution (quoted in the notes following <i>Pelo</i>) follows this case law by limiting restitutionary recovery to protect the life or health of another to providers of “professional services.” However, Comment <i>b</i>, after discussing various justifications for this limitation, states that this <span title="340" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-340">p. 340</span>restriction is not “logically inevitable. On the contrary, a claim in restitution based on an emergency rescue by a nonprofessional would be entirely consistent with the rule of this Section, in any case in which the court was satisfied <i>(inter alia)</i> that the claimant had not acted gratuitously, and that the benefit conferred was capable of valuation.”</p></li>

<p id="0348f383-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Several years ago one of the pilots employed by Alliance, William “Buck” Rogers, made a test flight of the prototype of Alliance’s A-1 bomber. During the flight a fire broke out in the cockpit. While Rogers could have avoided injury to himself by ejecting from the aircraft, had he done so the A-1 would have crashed, possibly into a nearby residential community. Under company policy, which was incorporated into Rogers’s employment contract, test pilots were required to use their best efforts to avoid the risk of harm to civilians. Instead of ejecting, Rogers flew the crippled plane back to its base, where he made an emergency crash landing; unfortunately, Rogers suffered serious injuries resulting in partial paralysis and ending his career as a test pilot.</p>

Rebecca Ray is the CEO and chief stockholder of a company which operates a successful on-line dating service, “Dates with Destiny.” Two weeks ago, when Rebecca was dining out with friends at a local seafood restaurant, she got a fishbone stuck in her throat. Making the throat-clutching gesture to signal choking, she attracted the attention of Myles Marlin, a real estate salesperson from out of town who was visiting local friends. Being familiar with the Heimlich Maneuver, Myles was able to assist Rebecca in dislodging the bone and breathing normally again. She thanked him profusely for saving her life at a time when her companions and the others around her seemed unable to be of assistance, and asked for his mailing address, so that she might send him a proper note of thanks and a suitable reward. He protested that it was really nothing, anyone would have done the same, but he did give her his business card, with an email and mailing address. Five days later, Myles received in the mail a thank-you greeting card, along with a check from Rebecca, made out to him, in the amount of $10,000. Written on the card was the message “Thank you – I owe you my life!! And here is my reward for you. – Rebecca.”</p>
<p id="03491aaa-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Myles immediately deposited the check in his bank account, and wrote Rebecca a note of thanks, which he mailed to her address (which was on the check). A few days later he got back from her a brief note, saying merely: “Sorry but my accountant says that was a mistake. But thanks anyway.” Around the same time, Myles was advised by his bank that payment on Rebecca’s check had been stopped before it cleared.</p>

She was accepted at a community college in her hometown, and also at a large private university, Stepford U. Initially, Ashley planned to attend the local college because of the high cost of attending Stepford, but her Aunt Ivy (her mother’s wealthy sister, who had attended Stepford herself) urged Ashley to attend Stepford even if it did mean Ashley would incur a larger burden of student debt. When Ashley hesitated, Aunt Ivy promised Ashley (in a written email note) that she (Aunt Ivy) would pay Ashley’s tuition at Stepford for her sophomore year if she finished the first year at Stepford with a grade point average of 3.0 or better. Ashley agreed, and attended Stepford for her first year of college with some financial help from her parents and the benefit of substantial student loans. She finished the year with a 3.4 GPA. When she notified her Aunt Ivy of that achievement, Ashley received the following response:</p>

Your local city school board operates a fleet of school buses to serve the students who live far enough from their school to require transportation. The 25 buses it is currently using were all purchased in 1995. Recently, the local newspaper reported that the school board was considering replacing a large part of its fleet of buses with newer, more energy-efficient ones. Hank Hill, the owner and operator of a tourists’ sightseeing business, wrote the following email note to Linda Lawrence, the chairman of the school board:</p>

Megan Murphy went shopping last Monday at a local bookstore and bought several books for herself and as gifts for her friends, at a total price of $92.58. She paid in cash, with five 20-dollar bills, and received back some bills and coins, which she put in her purse without looking carefully at them. When she got home she found a message on her land-line phone from the clerk in the bookstore (which had her number on file from prior ordering requests) saying that Megan had apparently been accidentally given a $50 bill in change, instead of a five. Megan looked in her purse and found a $50 bill there which had not been there earlier. Megan called the store, spoke to the clerk, confirmed the error, and said she would be in the store later that day to refund the extra amount.

We note that, because of the bailor-bailee relationship between the donor and charitable institution, the transaction here technically is a charitable pledge. See R.A. Brown, Personal Property §15.1, at 469 (3d ed. 1975) (defining a pledge as “a bailment of personal property to secure an obligation of the bailor”).</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="0340411d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN102E1_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" id="note-N102E1_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">4</a></span>&nbsp;In Congregation Kadimah Toras-Moshe v. DeLeo, 405 Mass. 365, 540 N.E.2d 691 (1989), the Congregation sued the estate of a decedent who had made an oral gratuitous promise to give $25,000 to the synagogue. The Congregation planned to spend the $25,000 on renovation of a storage room in the synagogue into a library. The oral promise was never memorialized in a writing or consummated by delivery before the decedent died intestate. Noting that “[a] hope or expectation, even though well founded, is not equivalent to either legal detriment or reliance,” id. at 366-367, 540 N.E.2d 691, we affirmed the judgment of the trial court that the oral charitable subscription was not enforceable because it was oral, not supported by consideration, and without evidence of reliance.</p>
<p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="0340411e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56">By requiring that a promise to make a charitable subscription be supported by consideration or reliance, we declined to adopt the standard for enforceable charitable subscriptions set forth in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts §90 (1981). See id. at 368, 540 N.E.2d 691. Section 90(1), as modified for charitable subscriptions by subsection (2), provides that, “[a] promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person . . . is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise. . . .” We noted that, although §90 thus dispenses with a strict requirement of consideration or reasonable reliance for a charitable subscription to be enforceable, the official comments to the Restatement make clear that consideration and reliance remain relevant to whether the promise must be enforced to avoid injustice. Id. See Arrowsmith v. Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., supra 313 Md. at 353-354, 545 A.2d 674 (rejecting argument that court should adopt Restatement [Second] of Contracts §90[2]); Jordan v. Mount Sinai Hosp. of Greater Miami, Inc., 276 So. 2d 102, at 108 (“Courts should act with restraint in respect to the public policy arguments endeavoring to sustain a mere charitable subscription. To ascribe consideration where there is none, or to adopt any other theory which affords charities a different legal rationale than other entities, is to approve fiction”).</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="03404126-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN1031A_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" id="note-N1031A_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">5</a></span>&nbsp;We do not suggest that bailment of property allegedly promised to a bailee-charity creates an irrebuttable presumption of donative intent on the part of the bailor. Nor do we suggest that we would weigh bailment more heavily than evidence that the parties agreed to conditions or terms of a bailment that express a lack of donative intent.</p>
<p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="03404127-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56">Intent is our primary concern and a bailment may be evidence of donative intent. However, a bailor and a bailee-charity may agree to a contractual bailment in terms that make clear that the bailed property is not being pledged as a future gift or that the bailed property may remain in the custody of the charity or become the charity’s property only if certain conditions are met. . . . </p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="03406838-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN1032A_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" id="note-N1032A_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">6</a></span>&nbsp;The jury could have found on that evidence alone that the first statement in the letter expressing an intent to give all papers in BU’s custody to it at some future date was not a mere statement of future intent when the bailment relationship is considered. However, there was evidence in addition to the bailor-bailee relationship which justified submission of the special questions on whether there was a charitable pledge to the jury. First, there was evidence the papers would be appraised for (Dr. King’s) tax purposes. Second, as promised in the letter, Dr. King delivered additional papers after the initial boxes of papers were delivered. This evidence could be considered by a jury in determining whether Dr. King intended to be bound by his promise. Thus, the trial judge did not err in submitting to the jury the first special question on charitable pledge. There was evidence which the jury could weigh in determining whether the statement of intent to give a gift of portions of the papers was an expression of an intent to be bound.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="034410e5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10BCC_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" id="note-N10BCC_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">2</a></span>&nbsp;Merv Griffin was the Chief Executive Officer and a large shareholder of Resorts.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="034437f9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10BE0_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" id="note-N10BE0_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">3</a></span>&nbsp;The reference to Belisle is John Belisle, then-Chief Operating Officer of Resorts.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="03445f17-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10C27_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" id="note-N10C27_2c3a7c73-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">4</a></span>&nbsp;Apparently, in late January 1995, Resorts spoke with another TCBY franchise, Host Marriott, regarding the Players Club’s space.

However, that presumption was rebuttable. See <i>Steffes,</i> 95 Wis. 2d at 501, 290 N.W.2d at 703-704. In <i>Steffes,</i> we held the presumption to be irrelevant where the plaintiff can show either an express or implied agreement to pay for those services, even where the plaintiff has rendered them “with a sense of affection, devotion and duty.” Id., 95 Wis. 2d at 503, 290 N.W.2d at 703-704.

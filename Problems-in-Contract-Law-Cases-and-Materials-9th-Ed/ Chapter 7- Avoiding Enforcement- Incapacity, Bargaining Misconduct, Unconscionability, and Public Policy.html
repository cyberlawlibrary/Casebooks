<p id="0376447c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Chapter 4 we saw that, under the statute of frauds, the failure of the parties to execute a writing may render an agreement unenforceable unless some exception to the statute is applicable. The requirement of <i>form</i> expressed by the statute of frauds (and by such other formalities as the parol evidence rule) reflects certain policies. (Recall the evidentiary, cautionary, and channelling functions of formalities discussed by Professor Fuller, reprinted after the <i>Pennsy Supply</i> case in Chapter 2.) In this chapter we turn our attention to other grounds for avoiding enforcement of an agreement. The doctrines examined in this chapter reflect policies somewhat different from those on which the statute of frauds is based: a concern with the <i>competency</i> of parties to make an agreement, with the <i>bargaining process</i> by which an agreement is reached, and with the <i>substance</i> of any resulting agreement.</p>
<p id="0376447d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have seen that modern courts have shown an increasing willingness to expand the scope of contractual obligation, both to rectify unjust enrichment and to redress injury resulting from detrimental reliance. Similarly, courts have broadened their role in interpreting agreements and in implying contractual provisions, to produce what the courts consider to be just outcomes. We will see a similar trend in the following materials, a widening of the grounds for avoiding enforcement of an agreement from those that existed during the classical period. As you study these materials, consider whether this expansion is desirable, or whether, as some critics contend, it is likely to produce arbitrary results that threaten the efficiency of the market system.<span title="572" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-572">p. 572</span></p>

The Swans told you over the telephone that they have a problem with a young man, Bob Byers, to whom they sold a car 12 months ago. They tell you that Bob is trying to cancel the deal because he was only 17 at the time that he purchased the car in August 2018. The Swans tell you that they have checked their records and Bob completed a portion of the purchase agreement by indicating that his date of birth was March 1, 2000. Bob is now stating that his date of birth is March 1, 2001, and he is demanding return of the sales price of $6,000. At the same time, Bob has told the Swans that the car is no longer operable and that the Swans should have the car towed from the street in front of Bob’s home.

<p id="03766b99-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is an action to disaffirm the contract of a minor for the purchase of a pick-up truck and for a refund of the purchase price. The issue is whether the minor is entitled to a full refund of the money he paid or whether the seller is entitled to a setoff for the decrease in value of the pick-up truck while it was in the possession of the minor.</p>
<p id="03766b9a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In early April of 1987, Joseph Eugene Dodson, then 16 years of age, purchased a used 1984 pick-up truck from Burns and Mary Shrader. The Shraders owned and operated Shrader’s Auto Sales in Columbia, Tennessee. Dodson paid $4,900 in cash for the truck, using money he borrowed from his girlfriend’s grandmother. At the time of the purchase there was no inquiry by the Shraders, and no misrepresentation by Mr. Dodson, concerning his minority. However, Mr. Shrader did testify that at the time he believed Mr. Dodson to be 18 or 19 years of age.</p>
<p id="03766b9b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In December 1987, nine (9) months after the date of purchase, the truck began to develop mechanical problems. A mechanic diagnosed the problem as a burnt valve, but could not be certain without inspecting the valves inside the engine. Mr. Dodson did not want, or did not have the money, to effect these repairs. He continued to drive the truck despite the mechanical problems. One month later, in January, the truck’s engine “blew up” and the truck became inoperable.</p>
<p id="037692ac-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Dodson parked the vehicle in the front yard at his parents’ home where he lived. He contacted the Shraders to rescind the purchase of the truck and requested a full refund. The Shraders refused to accept the tender of the truck or to give Mr. Dodson the refund requested.</p>
<p id="037692ad-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Dodson then filed an action in general sessions court seeking to rescind the contract and recover the amount paid for the truck. The general sessions <span title="573" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-573">p. 573</span>court dismissed the warrant and Mr. Dodson perfected a de novo appeal to the circuit court. At the time the appeal was filed in the circuit court Mr. Shrader, through counsel, declined to accept the tender of the truck without compensation for its depreciation. Before the circuit court could hear the case, the truck, while parked in Dodson’s front yard, was struck on the left front fender by a hit-and-run driver. At the time of the circuit court trial, according to Shrader, the truck was worth only $500 due to the damage to the engine and the left front fender.</p>
<p id="037692ae-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case was heard in the circuit court in November 1988. The trial judge, based on previous common-law decisions and, under the doctrine of stare decisis reluctantly granted the rescission. The Shraders were ordered, upon tender and delivery of the truck, to reimburse the $4,900 purchase price to Mr. Dodson. The Shraders appealed.</p>
<p id="037692af-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeals, per T<span class="epub-small-caps">odd</span>, J., affirmed; C<span class="epub-small-caps">antrell</span>, J., concurring separately, K<span class="epub-small-caps">och</span>, J., dissenting.</p>
<p id="037692b0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The earliest recorded case in this State, on the issue involved, appears to be in Wheaton v. East, 13 Tenn. 35 (5 Yeager 41) (1833). In pronouncing the rule to apply governing infant’s contracts, the court [quoted]:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="037692b1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . “that when the court can pronounce the contract to be to the infant’s prejudice, it is void, and when to his benefit, as for necessaries, it is good; and when the contract is of any uncertain nature, as to benefit or prejudice, it is voidable only, at the election of the infant.”</p>
</div>
<p id="037692b2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The law on the subject of the protection of infant’s rights has been slow to evolve. However, in Human v. Hartsell, 24 Tenn. App. 678, 148 S.W.2d 634, 636 (1940) the Court of Appeals noted:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="037692b3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . In Tuck v. Payne, 159 Tenn. 192, 17 S.W.2d 8, in an opinion by Mr. Justice McKinney, the modern rule that contracts of infants are not void but only voidable and subject to be disaffirmed by the minor either before or after attaining majority appears to have been favored.</p>
<p id="037692b4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under this rule the efforts of early authorities to classify contracts as beneficial or harmful and determine whether they are void or only voidable upon the basis of such classification are abandoned in favor of permitting the infant himself when he has become of age to determine what contracts are and what are not to his interest and liking. He is thus permitted to assume the burden of a contract, clearly disadvantageous to him, if he deems himself under a moral obligation to do so.</p>
<p id="037692b5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The adoption of this rule does not lead to any retrenchment of the infant’s rights but gives him the option of invoking contracts found to be advantageous but which, if held void, could not be enforced against the other party to the contract. Thus the minor can secure the advantage of contracts advantageous to himself and be relieved of the effect of an injudicious contract.</p>
<p id="037692b6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . .</p>
</div>
<p id="037692b7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As noted by the Court of Appeals, the rule in Tennessee, as modified, is in accord with the majority rule on the issue among our sister states. This rule is based upon the underlying purpose of the “infancy doctrine” which is to protect minors from their lack of judgment and “from squandering their wealth <span title="574" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-574">p. 574</span>through improvident contracts with crafty adults who would take advantage of them in the marketplace.” Halbman v. Lemke, 99 Wis. 2d 241, 245, 298 N.W.2d 562, 564 (1980).</p>
<p id="037692b8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is, however, a modern trend among the states, either by judicial action or by statute, in the approach to the problem of balancing the rights of minors against those of innocent merchants. As a result, two (2) minority rules have developed which allow the other party to a contract with a minor to refund less than the full consideration paid in the event of rescission.</p>
<p id="037692b9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first of these minority rules is called the “Benefit Rule.” E.g., Hall v. Butterfield, 59 N.H. 354 (1879); Johnson v. Northwestern Mut. Life Insurance Co., 56 Minn. 365, 59 N.W. 992 (1894); Berglund v. American Multigraph Sales Co., 135 Minn. 67, 160 N.W. 191 (1916); Porter v. Wilson, 106 N.H. 270, 209 A.2d 730 (1965); Valencia v. White, 134 Ariz. 139, 654 P.2d 287 (Ariz. App. 1982). The rule holds that, upon rescission, recovery of the full purchase price is subject to a deduction for the minor’s use of the merchandise. This rule recognizes that the traditional rule in regard to necessaries has been extended so far as to hold an infant bound by his contracts, where he failed to restore what he has received under them to the extent of the benefit actually derived by him from what he has received from the other party to the transaction. . . . </p>
<p id="037692ba-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The other minority rule holds that the minor’s recovery of the full purchase price is subject to a deduction for the minor’s “use” of the consideration he or she received under the contract, or for the “depreciation” or “deterioration” of the consideration in his or her possession. See . . . Pettit v. Liston, 97 Or. 464, 191 P. 660 (1920).</p>
<p id="037692bb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are impressed by the statement made by the Arizona Appeals Court in Valencia v. White, supra, citing the Court of Appeals of Ohio in Haydocy Pontiac Inc. v. Lee, 19 Ohio App. 2d 217, 250 N.E.2d 898 (1969):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="037692bc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At a time when we see young persons between 18 and 21 years of age demanding and assuming more responsibilities in their daily lives; when we see such persons emancipated, married, and raising families; when we see such persons charged with the responsibility for committing crimes; when we see such persons being sued in tort claims for acts of negligence; when we see such persons subject to military service; when we see such persons engaged in business and acting in almost all other respects as an adult, it seems timely to re-examine the case law pertaining to contractual rights and responsibilities of infants to see if the law as pronounced and applied by the courts should be redefined.</p>
</div>
<p id="037692bd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . Upon serious reflection we are convinced that a modified form of the Oregon rule should be adopted in this State concerning the rights and responsibilities of minors in their business dealings. . . . </p>
<p id="037692be-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We state the rule to be followed hereafter, in reference to a contract of a minor, to be where the minor has not been overreached in any way, and there has been no undue influence, and the contract is a fair and reasonable one, and the minor has actually paid money on the purchase price, and taken and used <span title="575" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-575">p. 575</span>the article purchased, that he ought not to be permitted to recover the amount actually paid, without allowing the vendor of the goods reasonable compensation for the use of, depreciation, and willful or negligent damage to the article purchased, while in his hands. If there has been any fraud or imposition on the part of the seller or if the contract is unfair, or any unfair advantage has been taken of the minor inducing him to make the purchase, then the rule does not apply. Whether there has been such an overreaching on the part of the seller, and the fair market value of the property returned, would always, in any case, be a question for the trier of fact. This rule will fully and fairly protect the minor against injustice or imposition, and at the same time it will be fair to a business person who has dealt with such minor in good faith.</p>
<p id="0376b9cf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This rule is best adapted to modern conditions under which minors are permitted to, and do in fact, transact a great deal of business for themselves, long before they have reached the age of legal majority. Many young people work and earn money and collect it and spend it oftentimes without any oversight or restriction. The law does not question their right to buy if they have the money to pay for their purchases. It seems intolerably burdensome for everyone concerned if merchants and business people cannot deal with them safely, in a fair and reasonable way. Further, it does not appear consistent with practice of proper moral influence upon young people, tend to encourage honesty and integrity, or lead them to a good and useful business future, if they are taught that they can make purchases with their own money, for their own benefit, and after paying for them, and using them until they are worn out and destroyed, go back and compel the vendor to return to them what they have paid upon the purchase price. Such a doctrine can only lead to the corruption of principles and encourage young people in habits of trickery and dishonesty. . . . </p>
<p id="0376b9d0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We note that in this case, some nine (9) months after the date of purchase, the truck purchased by the plaintiff began to develop mechanical problems. Plaintiff was informed of the probable nature of the difficulty which apparently involved internal problems in the engine. He continued to drive the vehicle until the engine “blew up” and the truck became inoperable. Whether or not this involved gross negligence or intentional conduct on his part is a matter for determination at the trial level. It is not possible to determine from this record whether a counterclaim for tortious damage to the vehicle was asserted. After the first tender of the vehicle was made by plaintiff, and refused by the defendant, the truck was damaged by a hit-and-run driver while parked on plaintiff’s property. The amount of that damage and the liability for that amount between the purchaser and the vendor, as well as the fair market value of the vehicle at the time of tender, is also an issue for the trier of fact.</p>
<p id="0376b9d1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with this judgment. The costs on appellate review are assessed equally between the parties.</p>

<li class=""><p id="0376b9d5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Traditional infancy or minority doctrine.</i> The <i>Dodson</i> court begins its analysis by recognizing the traditional rule that allows a minor to disaffirm or avoid a contract, even if there has been full performance and the minor cannot return to the adult what was received in the exchange. See E. Allan Farnsworth, Contracts §§4.4-4.5, at 222-227 (4th ed. 2004). Thus, if the minor received services that cannot be returned or the minor received goods that have since lost value, courts have allowed disaffirmance and required the minor to return only what the minor still possesses or any identifiable proceeds. The court in Halbman v. Lemke, 298 N.W.2d 562 (Wis. 1980), cited by the <i>Dodson</i> court, applied the traditional rule in holding that a minor who disaffirmed a contract for the purchase of an automobile was not required to make restitution to the seller for the substantial diminution in value of the vehicle, absent a showing that the minor misrepresented his age or willfully destroyed the property. The Court stated: “[W]e believe that to require a disaffirming minor to make restitution for diminished value is, in effect, to bind the minor to a part of the obligation which by law he is privileged to avoid.” Id. at 567.</p>
<p id="0376b9d6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Dodson</i> court, however, departs from the traditional rule and adopts an approach that requires a disaffirming minor to pay “reasonable compensation for the use of, depreciation, and willful or negligent damage to the article purchased, while in his hands,” at least when the minor is seeking return of the payment. Are you persuaded that the traditional rule has become outdated and that a disaffirming minor should be obligated to pay for any benefit received?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0376b9d7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The minority doctrine in the Internet world.</i> E.K.D. v. Facebook, Inc<i>.,</i> 885 F. Supp. 2d 894 (S.D. Ill. 2012), involved a class action by minor plaintiffs claiming that Facebook’s terms and conditions, which allowed Facebook to use a subscriber’s name, profile picture, and “likes” for advertising, violated state privacy laws. The plaintiffs claimed that the forum selection provision designating Santa Clara, California, as exclusive judicial venue was unenforceable because they were minors when they clicked the “agreed” button and began using Facebook. Similar to the holding in <i>Dodson</i>, the <i>E.K.D.</i> court stated that a minor must accept or repudiate the entire contract; a minor cannot keep the benefits of the contract by continuing to use Facebook while rejecting a provision (in this case the forum selection clause) that the minor finds burdensome. Under the traditional minority doctrine, however, the fact that the minor has benefited from the service in the past is not grounds to deny the minor the right to avoid the contract. See T. K. v. Adobe Systems Inc., 2018 WL 1812200 (N.D. Cal.) (under California law minor could disaffirm entire contract with arbitration clause after using Internet service for fourteen months without making restitution for benefit received); Cheryl B. Preston, CyberInfants, 39 Pepp. L. Rev. 225, 232-233 (2012).</p>
<p id="0376b9d8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notably, after the <i>E.K.D.</i> court rejected the plaintiffs’ minority argument, it found that Facebook’s forum selection clause was reasonable and enforceable, relying on the Supreme Court’s decision in Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute<i>,</i> 499 U.S. 585 (1991), where the Court held that a forum selection <span title="577" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-577">p. 577</span>clause in a cruise ticket that purported to bind the passenger to exclusive jurisdiction in Florida was enforceable against the plaintiff, a resident of the state of Washington, who was injured during a cruise from Los Angeles to Mexico. For criticism of the case see Charles L. Knapp, Contract Law Walks the Plank: Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute, 12 Nev. L.J. 553 (2012).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0376b9d9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Liability for “necessaries” and tortious conduct.</i> Even under the traditional rule, the right of a minor to avoid a contract has been subject to an important limitation: The minor is liable for the reasonable value of “necessaries.” The recovery for the adult allowed in these cases, however, is based on restitution rather than enforcement of the contract. See Garay v. Overholtzer, 631 A.2d 429 (Md. 1993); Restatement (Second) §12, Comment <i>f.</i> Necessaries usually have been limited to items that one needs to live, such as food, clothing, and shelter. Some courts have been willing to construe the concept more broadly. See Zelnick v. Adams, 561 S.E.2d 711 (Va. 2002) (contract for legal services may be a necessary if needed to protect rights of minor; legal services to protect inheritance rights could be a necessary depending on facts).</p>
<p id="0376b9da-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As suggested by the materials in Note 1, the minor’s ability to disaffirm may also be restricted if the minor engages in tortious conduct such as misrepresentation of age or willful destruction of goods. Some courts deny a minor’s claim for disaffirmance after the minor has misrepresented his age, others will allow disaffirmance despite misrepresentation of age, while a third group allows disaffirmance with potential tort liability. See Cheryl B. Preston &amp; Brandon T. Crowther, Infancy Doctrine Inquiries, 52 Santa Clara L. Rev. 47, 59-62 (2012).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0376b9db-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Ratification after reaching majority.</i> Even if a minor enters into a contract that does not involve necessaries, the contract is not void but only “voidable” at the election of the minor. Restatement (Second) §14. Once the minor reaches the age of majority, she has the power to affirm or ratify the contract, in which event the minor is bound. Moreover, on reaching the age of majority, the minor must act within a reasonable period of time to disaffirm the contract or she will be deemed to have affirmed the transaction. Compare Lopez v. Kmart Corporation, 2015 WL 2062606 (N.D. Cal.) (minor disaffirmed employment contract by filing lawsuit within one month of reaching majority, a reasonable time “by any measure”), with In re The Score Board, Inc., 238 B.R. 585 (Bankr. D.N.J. 1999) (professional basketball player Kobe Bryant, who signed contract while a minor but accepted payment and performed autograph signing duties for more than 18 months after reaching majority, held to have ratified contract).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0376b9dc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Statutory limits on the minority doctrine.</i> Legislative reduction of the age of majority from 21 to 18 in many states has, of course, curtailed the amount of litigation involving minors’ contracts. Some statutory provisions may apply to validate specific types of contracts made by a person even before reaching the age of majority. See, e.g., Sharon v. City of Newton, 769 N.E.2d 738 (Mass. 2002) (detailing Massachusetts state laws allowing minors to contract for education financing, life insurance, motor vehicle liability insurance, drug dependency treatment, and medical or dental care). On the other hand, some <span title="578" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-578">p. 578</span>statutory provisions may declare certain contracts by minors to be void (rather than voidable). For example, in California a minor cannot give a delegation of power, make a contract relating to real estate or any interest therein, or make a contract relating to personal property not in the immediate possession or control of the minor. See Cal. Fam. Code §6701.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0376b9dd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Avoidance of employment contract provisions.</i> In a number of cases raising issues similar to those in <i>Dodson</i>, courts have been divided on the question whether a minor should be allowed to disaffirm an employment agreement after the minor has received benefits derived from being employed. Compare Robinson v. Food Service, 415 F. Supp. 2d 1227 (D. Kan. 2005) (holding Kansas state courts would not allow minors to disaffirm employment contracts that on the whole had been beneficial) with PAK Foods Houston, LLC v. Garcia, 433 S.W.3d 171 (Tex. Ct. App. 2014) (minor employee allowed to rescind employment contract and avoid arbitration provision by disaffirmance in connection with filing of lawsuit against employer while still a minor). You should note that a minor may allege that an arbitration agreement is unenforceable for other reasons that will be discussed further in section D of this chapter on the unconscionability doctrine.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0376b9de-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Pre- and postinjury release agreements.</i> Sponsors of youth recreational activities such as soccer, little league baseball, gymnastics, or skiing, frequently require releases from liability for personal injury as a precondition to children being permitted to participate. Many courts have held that minors are able to disaffirm such preinjury exculpatory agreements signed by the parent. See, e.g., Galloway v. State of Iowa, 790 N.W.2d 252 (Iowa 2010) (public policy precludes parent’s pre-injury waiver of child’s claim for negligence while on field trip). On the other hand, the court in Zivich v. Mentor Soccer Club, Inc., 696 N.E.2d 201 (Ohio 1998), held that the minor could not disaffirm a release agreement signed by his parent before engaging in soccer play. In deciding to allow the parent to bind the minor to a preinjury release, the Ohio Supreme Court asserted that enforcement of the release supports two policy concerns: encouraging volunteer programs that promote organized recreational activities for children and recognition of the liberty interest of parents in making life choices for children.

<p id="0376b9df-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Postinjury settlement agreements on behalf of minors will typically involve the execution of a release of the minor’s claims. In most jurisdictions, settlements by minors must be approved by a court and may not be later disaffirmed. See, e.g., Wreglesworth v. Arctco, Inc., 738 N.E.2d 964 (Ill. App. Ct. 2000).</p></li>

<p id="0376e0f7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A family dispute over ownership of what had been the family home in Woburn prompted Frances M. Sparrow to file a complaint in the Superior Court against her sister, Susan A. Demonico, and Susan’s husband, David D. Demonico. Prior to trial, the parties resolved their differences by a settlement agreement reached during voluntary mediation. When Sparrow sought an order enforcing the agreement, a Superior Court judge denied her motion, concluding in essence that, due to mental impairment, Susan lacked the capacity to contract at the time of agreement. . . . </p>
<p id="0376e0f8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We granted . . . appellate review to consider whether a party can establish that she lacked the capacity to contract, thus making the contract voidable by her, in the absence of evidence that she suffered from a medically diagnosed, long-standing mental illness or defect. We conclude that our evolving standard of contractual incapacity does not in all cases require proof that a party’s claimed mental illness or defect was of some significant duration or that it is permanent, progressive, or degenerative; but, without medical evidence or expert testimony that the mental condition interfered with the party’s understanding of the transaction, or her ability to act reasonably in relation to it, the evidence will not be sufficient to support a conclusion of incapacity. Because the evidence was insufficient to support a determination of incapacity in this case, we vacate the motion judge’s order and remand for entry of an order enforcing the settlement agreement.</p>

<p id="0376e0fa-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sparrow’s complaint, filed initially in July, 2003, and later amended, alleged that Sparrow was entitled to a one-half interest in the Woburn property, consistent with the wishes of her (and Susan’s) now-deceased mother, under theories of constructive and resulting trusts. Susan, who resided in the Woburn property at the time of the mediation, and David, who had been separated from Susan for several years and was no longer residing with her, asserted that they were the sole owners of the property, as reflected in a deed, and denied that Sparrow had any interest in it. Shortly before what was scheduled to be a final pretrial conference, the parties sought to achieve a settlement through voluntary mediation and the matter was removed from the trial list.</p>
<p id="0376e0fb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The parties and the attorneys who were representing them in the Superior Court proceeding participated in mediation on October 19, 2006. Sparrow contends that the case was settled during this mediation by an agreement that the Demonicos would sell the property and pay Sparrow $100,000 from the sale proceeds. When Sparrow sought an order enforcing the agreement, alleging that the Demonicos “reneged on their obligations under it,” the Demonicos claimed that the agreement was unenforceable because Susan had, in their view, experienced a mental breakdown during the mediation and thus lacked the capacity to authorize <span title="580" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-580">p. 580</span>settlement. At an evidentiary hearing on the motion, David and Susan were the only witnesses and no exhibits were admitted, although they were marked for identification. The motion judge denied Sparrow’s motion on the basis that “the purported agreement may have been the product of an emotionally overwrought state of mind on the part of Susan Demonico.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN101C5_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N101C5_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">6</a></span> The case proceeded to trial by jury before a different judge, who, at the close of evidence, allowed the Demonicos’s motion for a directed verdict on all counts. Sparrow appealed from the judgment and the denial of her motion to enforce the mediated settlement agreement.</p>

<p id="0376e0ff-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the date of the scheduled mediation, Susan drove from her home to David’s residence. From there, David drove them to the location of the mediation session because, in David’s view, Susan was not capable of driving to the mediation. The mediation began at approximately 9 A.M. and ended at 3 P.M. The judge, crediting David’s testimony, found:</p>

<p id="0376e100-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Susan was having a breakdown that day, according to David, and was slurring her words, although she had not had any alcoholic beverages on that day. She became less coherent throughout the day, was crying and out of control. . . . They left the mediation before it was over as Susan could not handle it.</p>
</div>
<p id="0376e101-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judge noted Susan’s testimony that she had been taking a medication, Zoloft, prior to the mediation, but that she had stopped taking the medication at some point before the mediation, and that she cried much of the day; he specifically credited Susan’s testimony that she “was out of control emotionally during the mediation” and found also that “she was not thinking rationally” on that day.</p>
<p id="0376e102-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As noted, both sides were represented by counsel throughout the mediation.

Co. v. Commissioner of Ins.,</i> 406 Mass. 354, 360 n.7, 548 N.E.2d 188 (1990). It has been long established that a contract is voidable by a person who, due to mental illness or defect, lacked the capacity to contract at the time of entering into the agreement<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10208_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10208_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">9</a></span>. . . . The burden is on the party seeking to void the contract to establish that the person was incapacitated at the time of the transaction. . . . See <i>Wright v.

<p id="03770818-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As Justice Holmes observed, it is a question of fact whether a person was competent to enter into a transaction — that is, whether the person suffered from “insanity” or “was of unsound mind, and incapable of understanding and deciding upon the terms of the contract.” Id. at 182-183. In <i>Reed v. Mattapan Deposit &amp; Trust Co.,</i> 198 Mass. 306, 314, 84 N.E. 469 (1908), we described this inquiry as the “true test” of mental incapacity:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03770819-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But while great mental weakness of the individual may exist without being accompanied by an entire loss of reason, and mental incapacity in one case is not necessarily so in another, in such an inquiry the true test is, was the party whose contract it is sought to avoid in such a state of insanity at the time as to render him incapable of transacting the business. When this fact is established the contract is voidable by the lunatic or his representatives, and it is no defense under our decisions that the other party acted fairly and without knowledge of his unsoundness or of any circumstances which ought to have put him upon inquiry.</p>
</div>
<p id="0377081a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We applied this test, also known as the “cognitive test,” see <i>Ortelere v. Teachers’ Retirement Bd. of the City of N.Y.,</i> 25 N.Y.2d 196, 202, 250 N.E.2d 460, 303 N.Y.S.2d 362 (1969) <i>(Ortelere),</i> without significant modification for fifty years thereafter. See . . . <i>Adams v. Whitmore,</i> 245 Mass. 65, 68, 139 N.E. 831 (1923) (incapacity requires proof that person “was too weak in mind to execute the deed with <span title="582" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-582">p. 582</span>understanding of its meaning, effect and consequences”); <i>Sutcliffe v.

<p id="0377081b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Over time, however, the traditional test for contractual incapacity, both in Massachusetts, see <i>Krasner v. Berk,</i> 366 Mass. 464, 467-468, 319 N.E.2d 897 (1974), and in other jurisdictions, see, e.g., <i>Ortelere, supra,</i> evolved to incorporate an increased understanding of the nature of mental illness in its various forms. See <i>Matter of the Marriage of Davis,</i> 193 Ore. App. 279, 285-287, 89 P.3d 1206 (2004) (Deits, C.J., concurring) (discussing evolution of incapacity standards); 5 R.A. Lord, Williston on Contracts §10:8 at 341-343 (4th ed. 2009) (historically, little distinction made between different kinds of mental incompetency or illness; “[t]he law now recognizes a wide variety of types and degrees of mental incompetency and distinctions among the various types of mental illness”). Based on this understanding, we adopted a second, alternative test for incapacity.</p>
<p id="0377081c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Krasner v. Berk, supra,</i> we recognized that there may be circumstances when, although a party claiming incapacity has some, or sufficient, understanding of the nature and consequences of the transaction, the contract would still be voidable where, “by reason of mental illness or defect, [the person] is unable to act in a reasonable manner in relation to the transaction and the other party has reason to know of his condition.” Id. at 468, citing <i>Ortelere, supra</i> at 204-205.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10262_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10262_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">11</a></span> This modern test — also described as an “affective” or “volitional” test — recognizes that competence can be lost, not only through cognitive disorders, but through affective disorders that encompass motivation or exercise of will. See <i>Ortelere, supra</i> at 204-205, . . . See also <i>Gore v. Gadd,</i> 268 Ore. 527, 528-529, 522 P.2d 212 (1974) (under affective test, person such as one who is manic-depressive psychotic, although aware of nature and consequences of conduct, may still be considered incompetent because mental illness “impel[s person] to act irrationally” and such person is “incapable of making a rational judgment in the execution of the transaction”).</p>
<p id="0377081e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under this modern, affective test, “[w]here a person has some understanding of a particular transaction which is affected by mental illness or defect, the controlling consideration is whether the transaction in its result is one which a reasonably competent person might have made.” <i>Krasner v.

<p id="03770821-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We begin by observing that the evidence required to support a finding of incapacity to contract, whether considered under the traditional or modern standard, need not in all cases demonstrate that a party suffers from a mental illness or defect that is permanent, degenerative, progressive, or of significant duration. Although such incapacity has historically been established by evidence of a long-standing mental illness, nothing in our jurisprudence requires such evidence. The inquiry as to the capacity to contract focuses on a party’s understanding or conduct only at the time of the disputed transaction. See <i>Krasner v. Berk, supra</i> at 468; <i>Meserve v. Jordan Marsh Co.,</i> 340 Mass. 660, 662, 165 N.E.2d 905 (1960). Based on the evolving understanding of mental illness, we do not preclude the possibility that a party could establish an incapacity to contract without proof of a mental condition that is permanent, degenerative, progressive, or long standing.</p>
<p id="03770822-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Demonicos contend that this is such a case; that the evidence established Susan’s incapacity without showing a permanent, degenerative, progressive, or long-standing mental illness. They point to evidence that Susan’s asserted mental impairment arose and was limited to the period of the mediation session, and argue that this evidence was sufficient to support a conclusion of incapacity, despite the lack of medical evidence or expert testimony as to the nature of Susan’s mental impairment and its effect on her decision-making ability.</p>
<p id="03770823-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have not previously addressed whether medical evidence is required to establish an incapacity to contract, and the Demonicos have not directed our attention to case law in other jurisdictions that would support their contention. In our prior decisions concerning the issue of incapacity to contract, however, evidence of mental illness or defect has been presented consistently through medical evidence, including the testimony of physicians and mental health providers or experts, in addition to lay testimony.” Moreover, in other contexts, we have held that a lay witness is not competent to give an opinion as to mental condition. See <i>Commonwealth v. McDermott,</i> 393 Mass. 451, 454, 471 N.E.2d 1302 (1984). . . . Expanding on this analysis, we conclude that medical evidence is necessary to establish that a person lacked the capacity to contract due to the existence of a mental condition.</p>

See, e.g., <i>Commonwealth v. DiPadova,</i> 460 Mass. 424, 426-428, 951 N.E.2d 891 (2011) (criminal responsibility); <i>O’Rourke v. Hunter,</i> 446 Mass. 814, 822, 848 N.E.2d 382 (2006) (testamentary capacity). See also <i>Vitek v. Jones,</i> 445 U.S. 480, 495, 100 S. Ct. 1254, 63 L. Ed. 2d 552 (1980), quoting <i>Addington v. Texas,</i> 441 U.S. 418, 429, 99 S. Ct. 1804, 60 L. Ed. 2d 323 (1979) (question of mental illness in civil commitment context is “essentially medical,” which “turns on the meaning of facts which must be interpreted by expert psychiatrists and psychologists”).</p>
<p id="03770825-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where the issue is the capacity to contract, we have looked to medical providers or experts to explain whether, and to what extent, a person’s mental condition has affected the ability to understand the nature of the transaction and its consequences, or to explain why, despite the intellectual and cognitive ability to understand, the person is unable to act reasonably in making the decision. See, e.g., <i>Krasner v. Berk, supra</i> at 466; <i>Meserve v. Jordan Marsh Co., supra</i> at 663-664. . . . </p>
<p id="03772f36-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The inquiry in this area is in contrast to other areas of the law, such as tort claims of emotional distress or mental anguish, where the inquiry is whether the evidence supports a plaintiff’s claim to have experienced emotional distress or mental anguish, rather than on the impact of that state on the ability to comprehend. See <i>Sullivan v. Boston Gas Co.,</i> 414 Mass. 129, 138, 605 N.E.2d 805 (1993). Yet even in the context of an action sounding in tort, we have often considered medical corroboration to be a highly probative, if not essential, component of a plaintiff’s case. See id. at 137-138; . . . See also <i>Bresnahan v. McAuliffe,</i> 47 Mass. App. Ct. 278, 285, 712 N.E.2d 1173 (1999) (more difficult, but not impossible, for plaintiff to meet burden in absence of medical evidence). Such corroboration not only guards against feigned or fraudulent claims of mental distress, but also alleviates the concern “that even honest plaintiffs erroneously might convince themselves that they suffer from emotional distress . . . thereby compounding the problem of fraudulent lawsuits.” <i>Sullivan v. Boston Gas Co., supra</i> at 133, citing <i>Payton v. Abbott Labs, supra</i> at 547. These concerns apply with at least equal force where the question is the capacity to contract due to mental impairment. See <i>Ortelere, supra</i> at 206 (“nothing less serious than medically classified psychosis should suffice or else few contracts would be invulnerable to some kind of psychological attack”).</p>

Susan testified also that she had recently discontinued taking the prescribed medication Zoloft. However, she presented no medical evidence regarding a diagnosis that would have required her to take the medication, or the effect, if any, that ceasing to take the medication would have had on her medical or mental condition. There was also no evidence that Susan’s condition at the mediation was related to or caused by her discontinuing the medication.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN102DE_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N102DE_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">14</a></span></p>

Co.</i> 336 Mass. 609, 614, 147 N.E.2d 160 (1958) (wife’s testimony about nervous condition of husband prior to his death, although admissible as matter of common observation by lay person, not sufficient to prove whether disease was proximate or contributing cause of death). However, there was no expert or medical testimony to explain the effect of Susan’s experiences or behavior on her ability to understand the agreement, to appreciate what was happening, or to comprehend the reasonableness of the settlement terms or the consequences to her of authorizing the settlement. Without such medical evidence, there was no basis to conclude that Susan lacked the capacity to contract. See <i>Farnum v. Silvano, supra</i> at 539-540 (plaintiff, who “suffered mental disease which had manifested itself in erratic and irrational conduct and was confirmed by diagnostic test,” did not possess “requisite contextual understanding” of transaction). Contrast <i>Grindlinger v. Grindlinger,</i> 10 Mass. App. Ct. 823, 823, 406 N.E.2d 424 (1980) (“fatigue and anxiety” not sufficient to invalidate separation agreement).</p>
<p id="03772f3a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The evidence did not support a conclusion that, under the traditional test for incapacity, Susan was incapable of understanding the nature and quality of the transaction, or of grasping its significance. Indeed, based on Susan’s testimony, she understood at the time that she was participating in a mediation to discuss settlement of the lawsuit; she was aware that the subject of the mediation was to resolve the dispute regarding the family home in Woburn; she participated in the mediation and listened to the arguments of counsel; and she “couldn’t believe how things [were] turning out.”</p>
<p id="03772f3b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is apparent from Susan’s testimony that, even if she suffered from a transient mental defect, or “breakdown” as the judge concluded, she had at least some understanding of the nature of the transaction and was aware of its consequences. Under the modern test to establish Susan’s incapacity, the evidence was similarly insufficient. There was no evidence that the settlement agreement was unreasonable, or that a reasonably competent person would not have entered into it.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN102FC_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N102FC_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">15</a></span></p>

<li class=""><p id="03772f42-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Cognitive and volitional tests for incapacity and the requirement of medical testimony.</i> Even without a formal adjudication of incompetency, contract law provides that a person may lack contractual capacity, as recognized by the court in <i>Sparrow.</i> As the court discusses, the traditional test for incapacity was the “cognitive” test under which a person lacks capacity to enter into a contract if the person is unable to understand the nature of the transaction or its consequences. The more modern “volitional” test looks to whether the person is unable to act reasonably in the transaction and the other party has reason to know of the condition. The court relies on the <i>Ortelere</i> case decided by the New York Court of Appeals in 1969 for its adoption of the volitional test. The Restatement (Second) in §15 also follows the volitional test and includes the following illustration based on <i>Ortelere</i>:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03772f43-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>A</i>, a school teacher, is a member of a retirement plan and has elected a lower monthly benefit in order to provide a benefit to her husband if she dies first. At age 60 she suffers a “nervous breakdown,” takes a leave of absence, and is treated for cerebral arteriosclerosis. When the leave expires she applies for retirement, revokes her previous election, and elects a larger annuity with no death benefit. In view of her reduced life expectancy, the change is foolhardy, and there are no other circumstances to explain the change. She fully understands the plan, but by reason of mental illness is unable to make a decision based on the prospect of her dying before her husband. The officers of the plan have reason to know of her condition. Two months after the changed election she dies. The change of election is voidable.</p>
</div>
<p id="03772f44-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Restatement (Second) §15, Illustration 1. Further understanding of the <i>Ortelere</i> case can be gained from Richard Danzig &amp; Geoffrey R. Watson, The Capability Problem in Contract Law 242-306 (2d ed. 2004), which includes excerpts from the <i>Ortelere</i> trial transcript.</p>
<p id="03772f45-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A dissenting judge in <i>Ortelere</i> expressed concern that any benefit gained by use of the volitional test would be “outweighed by frivolous claims which will burden our courts and undermine the security of contracts.” Ortelere v. Teachers’ Retirement Bd., 250 N.E.2d 460, 468 (N.Y. 1969) (Jasen, J., dissenting). The court’s decision in <i>Sparrow</i> to require medical evidence or expert <span title="587" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-587">p. 587</span>testimony to establish a claim of contractual incapacity is responsive to this concern. On the other hand, it could be argued that a strict requirement of medical evidence may be too expensive and burdensome, particularly when the case is relatively small. Moreover, the court’s effort to distinguish tort claims of mental distress damages, which are not subject to a requirement of medical testimony, could be viewed as unpersuasive. Do you agree with the court’s requirement of medical evidence or expert testimony to establish contractual incapacity? But see Whitlock v. Burke, 2018 WL 3482003 (Mass. Land Ct.) (interpreting <i>Sparrow</i> to require <i>medical evidence,</i> but not necessarily from a <i>medical doctor,</i> in assessing testimony from a clinical psychologist).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03772f46-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b> <i>Mental incapacity contrasted with minority doctrine.</i></b> The law concerning mental incapacity has a great deal in common with the minority doctrine concerning matters such as liability for necessaries and the possibility of disaffirmance or ratification. Regarding the obligation to make restoration of consideration upon disaffirmance, however, an important distinction between the traditional rules on minority doctrine and mental incapacity exists: the minor generally can disaffirm even if restoration cannot be made, but the mentally incompetent person is required to make restoration to the other party unless special circumstances are present. See Restatement (Second) §15(2). Are you persuaded that there is good justification for the different approaches to restitution in minority and mental incapacity cases?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03772f47-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Effect of court-decreed guardianship.</i></b> Statutory law in each state establishes procedures by which a court on petition of a family member or other interested party can declare a person legally incompetent and appoint a guardian or conservator to care for the incompetent’s person or property. E.g., Unif. Prob. Code, §§5-301 (guardian of person of incompetent), 5-401 (conservator of property of incompetent). The general rule is that a person does not have capacity to enter into contracts if the person’s property is under conservatorship. Restatement (Second) §13. See Sun Trust Bank v. Harper, 551 S.E.2d 419 (Ga. Ct. App. 2002) (after being placed under guardianship by court, decedent lacked capacity to modify terms of retirement account notwithstanding alleged lucid moments); Huntington National Bank v. Toland, 594 N.E.2d 1103 (Ohio Ct. App. 1991) (though decedent maintained “sparkling” record in dealings with bank for four-year period before death, adjudication of mental incompetency 35 years earlier still rendered contract voidable unless ratified by guardian). While cases involving court-appointed guardians and/or conservators do arise, they are typically extreme situations.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03775658-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Vulnerability to misconduct by other parties.</i></b> In another type of case a party asserts not only lack of capacity but also a claim that the other party engaged in overreaching or other improper conduct. In such cases claims of incapacity are often combined with allegations of fraud, duress, or undue influence. An example is Farnum v. Silvano, 540 N.E.2d 202 (Mass. App. Ct. 1989), cited by the court in <i>Sparrow</i>, which involved a sale by an elderly plaintiff, Viola Farnum, of her home to the defendant for a price of $65,000 when the home had a fair market value of $115,000 and at a time when she had a growing need <span title="588" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-588">p. 588</span>for income. The defendant, who did yard work for the plaintiff, knew of the plaintiff’s unstable mental condition, which manifested itself in a variety of ways, including the following:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03775659-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">She would lament not hearing from sisters who were dead. She would wonder where the people upstairs in her house had gone, but there was no upstairs to her house. . . . She became abnormally forgetful. Frequently, she locked herself out of her house and broke into it, rather than calling on a neighbor with whom she had left a key. . . . She hid her cat to protect it from “the cops . . . looking for my cat.” She would express a desire to return to Cape Cod although she was on Cape Cod. . . . </p>
</div>
<p id="0377565a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Id. at 203. Finding that the plaintiff lacked the mental capacity to enter into the contract and that the defendant was aware of this condition, the Court of Appeals ordered rescission of the contract. In light of this conclusion, the court found it unnecessary to consider the claims of fraud, undue influence, and constructive trust that Farnum had also advanced. See also footnote 12 in <i>Sparrow</i> where the court states that even when the evidence is insufficient to establish incapacity, evidence of a weakened mental state may be relevant to other legal theories seeking to show that advantage was taken of the weaker party.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0377565b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Burden of proof and relevant time for determining capacity.</i></b>  As stated in <i>Sparrow</i>, the burden of proof is on the party seeking to avoid a contract. This burden may be difficult to carry. See In re Estate of Obermeier, 540 N.Y.S.2d 613 (App. Div. 1989) (fact that decedent resided in nursing home, was often confused, suffered from dementia, and was on sedatives did not prove lack of capacity at time of signing contract to sell real property); Rawlings v. John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co., 78 S.W.3d 291 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2001) (evidence that decedent was an alcoholic and suffered from depression and dementia was insufficient to prove that she did not have capacity to understand consequences or act in reasonable manner at particular time transaction was made).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0377565c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Mental incapacity in other areas of law.</i></b>  The court states that incapacity to contract is subject to a more demanding standard of proof than lack of testamentary capacity. Why should this be so? In criminal cases, the traditional standard for mental capacity has been the M’Naghten test. M’Naghten’s Case, 8 Eng. Rep. 718 (1843). Under this test a defendant lacks mental capacity to commit a crime if the defendant is unable to distinguish right from wrong. Rollin M. Perkins &amp; Ronald Boyce, Criminal Law 958-963 (1982). The Model Penal Code recognizes incapacity as consisting of inability to either “appreciate the criminality” of conduct or “conform his conduct to the requirements of law.” Model Penal Code §4.01 (1962). How do these standards compare to the standard for contractual capacity as expressed in §15 of the Restatement (Second)? Should it be easier or more difficult to establish incapacity in criminal prosecutions or breach of contract cases? Why?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0377565d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Incapacity resulting from intoxication.</i></b>  The Restatement (Second) §16 provides that a contract is voidable if a party has reason to know that because of intoxication the other person is unable to either understand the transaction <span title="589" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-589">p. 589</span>or act in a reasonable manner. Comment <i>a</i> to the section states that “compulsive alcoholism” may be a form of mental illness but also recognizes that intoxication may be “voluntary.” Should intoxication that is a temporary, self-induced condition affect a person’s ability to disaffirm a contract? See Adamar of N.J., Inc. v. Luber, 2011 WL 1325978 (D.N.J.) (triable issue of fact whether defendant’s $220,000 gambling debt was incurred while his judgment was so impaired by intoxication, to plaintiff’s knowledge, as to render him incapable of consent); Miller v. Rhode Island Hospital, 625 A.2d 778 (R.I. 1993) (reversing trial court and holding intoxication can render a patient incompetent to give consent to treatment).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0377565e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Mediation in the practice of law.</i></b>  You are probably already aware that many modern contracts contain provisions requiring any dispute related to the contract be resolved by binding arbitration. We consider such provisions in more detail later in this chapter, particularly on the issue of when they may be so one-sided as to be considered “unconscionable.” However, <i>Sparrow</i> involves a different form of alternative dispute resolution that is probably even more common than arbitration — mediation. In fact, mediation has become so widespread that many lawyers devote a substantial portion of their practice to serving as mediators. Compared to litigation and arbitration, mediation is the least formal and least binding of the three. In mediation a neutral third party assists the parties in attempting to reach an agreement to resolve their dispute. Unlike a judge or an arbitrator, a mediator does not have the power to render a decision. Instead, the mediator is a facilitator. In the typical mediation after a joint session, where the parties make presentations to the mediator and each other, the mediator meets separately with the parties in a series of private meetings that can last for hours in small cases and weeks or longer in more complex ones. Skilled mediators can help the parties understand the other side’s position, see weaknesses in their own positions, evaluate alternatives for compromise that they may not have considered, and make concessions to bridge the gaps between the parties. Mediation comes in two varieties: court ordered and voluntary. Many court systems require the parties to mediate any dispute before the case can proceed to trial. However, in court-ordered mediation parties are only required to bargain in good faith; they are not required to reach agreement. Even if the rules of court do not require mediation, parties may choose to do so in an attempt to avoid the time and expense of trial if possible. If a mediation results in an agreement, it will be reduced to writing and amounts to a contract, subject to the same requirements of other contracts. Thus, in <i>Sparrow</i> Susan Demonico claimed that the contract that resulted from the mediation in the case was unenforceable because of her incapacity at the time of the mediation.</p></li>

<div class="epub-heading left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="0377565f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56">Comment: Historical Development of the Law of Contractual Capacity</p></h3></div>
<p id="03775660-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Quite early, the common law declared that certain classes of persons lacked “capacity” to contract. Alfred W. B. Simpson, A History of the Common Law <span title="590" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-590">p. 590</span>of Contract 539-557 (1987). In the case of minors (also commonly referred to as “infants”), this restriction could be justified on the ground that they did not have the judgment to protect themselves in the marketplace. The same justification was not applicable to married women, however, who were also denied the right to contract at common law. Instead, the theory behind this restriction was that marriage resulted in the union of husband and wife into a single legal personality, that of the husband. As Professor Lawrence Friedman has put it, “husband and wife were one flesh; but the man was the owner of that flesh.” Lawrence M. Friedman, A History of American Law (3d ed. 2005). During the nineteenth century, this legal disability was removed by the passage of the Married Women’s Property Acts. See Richard H. Chused, Married Women’s Property Law: 1800-1850, 71 Geo. L.J. 1359 (1983).</p>
<p id="03775661-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Statutory restrictions have also been imposed on the capacity of other persons to make contracts. During the period of legalized slavery in this country, many states enacted “Slave Codes,” which denied enslaved persons legal capacity to contract for themselves. See Anthony R. Chase, Race, Culture, and Contract Law: From the Cottonfield to the Courtroom, 28 Conn. L. Rev. 1 (1995). During the same period, some states restricted the ability of free African-Americans to enter into certain types of contracts and exercise other civil rights. See John Hope Franklin and Alfred A. Moss, Jr., From Slavery to Freedom 141(8th ed. 2000); Steven A. Siegel, The Federal Government’s Power to Enact Color-Conscious Laws: An Originalist Inquiry, 92 Nw. U. L. Rev. 477 (1998). Even after the Civil War and the end of legalized slavery, many states enacted “Black Codes,” which continued to restrict the ability of African-Americans to make and enforce contracts. See John Hope Franklin and Alfred A. Moss, Jr., From Slavery to Freedom 250-251 (8th ed. 2000). Restrictions on contract and property rights have also been placed on other people of color, including Asian-Americans. See Angelo N. Ancheta, Race, Rights and the Asian American Experience (2d ed. 2006); Natsu Taylor Saito, Alien and Non-Alien Alike: Citizenship, “Foreignness,” and Racial Hierarchy in American Law, 76 Or. L. Rev. 261 (1997). Some writers have discussed such restrictions on contract and property rights as part of a broader denial of “economic personality.” See Adrienne D. Davis, The Private Law of Race and Sex: An Antebellum Perspective, 51 Stan. L. Rev. 221 (1999); Thomas W. Joo, New “Conspiracy Theory” of the Fourteenth Amendment: Nineteenth Century Chinese Civil Rights Cases and the Development of Substantive Due Process Jurisprudence, 29 U.S.F. L. Rev. 353 (1995). While such formal legal restrictions on the capacity to contract were largely removed with the enactment of federal and state civil rights laws, informal cultural and social barriers have been much more difficult to overcome. See Keith Aoki, Direct Democracy, Racial Group Agency, Local Government Law and Residential Racial Segregation: Some Reflections on Radical and Plural Democracy, 33 Cal. W. L. Rev. 185 (1997); Neil G. Williams, Offer, Acceptance, and Improper Consideration: A Common Law Model for the Prohibition of Racial Discrimination in the Contracting Process, 62 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 183 (1994). The removal of race- and gender-based restrictions on the ability to contract <span title="591" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-591">p. 591</span>reflected a new societal consensus that such laws were designed to oppress, rather than protect, the affected groups.</p>

<p id="03775664-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At a very early time the common law recognized that some agreements should not be legally enforceable because of the process by which they were made. In the thirteenth century, agreements made while one party was under physical imprisonment or threat of physical harm were unenforceable at law because made under “duress.” While such relief at law was limited to cases involving actual or threatened physical harm, over time the courts of equity recognized a right to relief against other types of coercion, under the doctrine of “undue influence.” The equitable doctrine of undue influence, however, was not unlimited in its application. Generally, a court of equity would not act unless the undue influence arose between family members or in some other confidential or “fiduciary” relationship, such as between lawyer and client or between trustee and beneficiary.</p>
<p id="03775665-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since these early days, the doctrines of duress and undue influence have undergone a dramatic expansion. Courts have gradually broadened the types of threats that are considered improper under the defense of duress, first to threats to a person’s property (known as “duress of goods”) and later to “economic duress.” Similarly, the defense of undue influence has been extended to situations that do not involve a confidential relationship. The history of these developments is traced in John P. Dawson, Economic Duress — An Essay in Perspective, 45 Mich. L. Rev. 253 (1947). The materials that follow illustrate this more modern approach.</p>

<p id="03777d81-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Totem is a closely held Alaska corporation which began operations in March of 1975. Richard Stair, at all times relevant to this case, was vice-president of Totem. In <span title="592" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-592">p. 592</span>June of 1975, Totem entered into a contract with Alyeska under which Totem was to transport pipeline construction materials from Houston, Texas, to a designated port in southern Alaska, with the possibility of one or two cargo stops along the way. In order to carry out this contract, which was Totem’s first, Totem chartered a barge (the “Marine Flasher”) and an ocean-going tug (the “Kirt Chouest”). These charters and other initial operations costs were made possible by loans to Totem from Richard Stair individually and Pacific, Inc., a corporation of which Stair was principal stockholder and officer, as well as by guarantees by Stair and Pacific.</p>
<p id="03777d82-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By the terms of the contract, Totem was to have completed performance by approximately August 15, 1975. From the start, however, there were numerous problems which impeded Totem’s performance of the contract. For example, according to Totem, Alyeska represented that approximately 1,800 to 2,100 tons of regular uncoated pipe were to be loaded in Houston, and that perhaps another 6,000 or 7,000 tons of materials would be put on the barge at later stops along the west coast. Upon the arrival of the tug and barge in Houston, however, Totem found that about 6,700 to 7,200 tons of coated pipe, steel beams and valves, haphazardly and improperly piled, were in the yard to be loaded. This situation called for remodeling of the barge and extra cranes and stevedores, and resulted in the loading taking thirty days rather than the three days which Totem had anticipated it would take to load 2,000 tons. The lengthy loading period was also caused in part by Alyeska’s delay in assuring Totem that it would pay for the additional expenses, bad weather and other administrative problems.</p>
<p id="03777d83-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The difficulties continued after the tug and barge left Houston. It soon became apparent that the vessels were travelling more slowly than anticipated because of the extra load. In response to Alyeska’s complaints and with its verbal consent, on August 13, 1975, Totem chartered a second tug, the “N. Joseph Guidry.” When the “Guidry” reached the Panama Canal, however, Alyeska had not yet furnished the written amendment to the parties’ contract. Afraid that Alyeska would not agree to cover the cost of the second tug, Stair notified the “Guidry” not to go through the Canal. After some discussions in which Alyeska complained of the delays and accused Totem of lying about the horsepower of the first tug, Alyeska executed the amendment on August 21, 1975.</p>
<p id="03777d84-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By this time the “Guidry” had lost its preferred passage through the Canal and had to wait two or three additional days before it could go through. Upon finally meeting, the three vessels encountered the tail of a hurricane which lasted for about eight or nine days and which substantially impeded their progress.</p>
<p id="03777d85-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The three vessels finally arrived in the vicinity of San Pedro, California, where Totem planned to change crews and refuel. On Alyeska’s orders, however, the vessels instead pulled into port at Long Beach, California. At this point, Alyeska’s agents commenced off-loading the barge, without Totem’s consent, without the necessary load survey, and without a marine survey, the absence of which voided Totem’s insurance. After much wrangling and some concessions by Alyeska, the freight was off-loaded. Thereafter, on or about September 14, <span title="593" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-593">p. 593</span>1975, Alyeska terminated the contract. Although there was talk by an Alyeska official of reinstating the contract, the termination was affirmed a few days later at a meeting at which Alyeska officials refused to give a reason for the termination.</p>
<p id="03777d86-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Following termination of the contract, Totem submitted termination invoices to Alyeska and began pressing the latter for payment. The invoices came to something between $260,000 and $300,000. An official from Alyeska told Totem that they would look over the invoices but that they were not sure when payment would be made—perhaps in a day or perhaps in six to eight months. Totem was in urgent need of cash as the invoices represented debts which the company had incurred on 10-30 day payment schedules. Totem’s creditors were demanding payment and according to Stair, without immediate cash, Totem would go bankrupt. Totem then turned over the collection to its attorney, Roy Bell, directing him to advise Alyeska of Totem’s financial straits. Thereafter, Bell met with Alyeska officials in Seattle, and after some negotiations, Totem received a settlement offer from Alyeska for $97,500. On November 6, 1975, Totem, through its president Stair, signed an agreement releasing Alyeska from all claims by Totem in exchange for $97,500.</p>
<p id="03777d87-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On March 26, 1976, Totem, Richard Stair, and Pacific filed a complaint against Alyeska, which was subsequently amended. In the amended complaint, the plaintiffs sought to rescind the settlement and release on the ground of economic duress and to recover the balance allegedly due on the original contract. In addition, they alleged that Alyeska had wrongfully terminated the contract and sought miscellaneous other compensatory and punitive damages.</p>
<p id="03777d88-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before filing an answer, Alyeska moved for summary judgment against the plaintiffs on the ground that Totem had executed a binding release of all claims against Alyeska and that as a matter of law, Totem could not prevail on its claim of economic duress. In opposition, plaintiffs contended that the purported release was executed under duress in that Alyeska wrongfully terminated the contract; that Alyeska knew that Totem was faced with large debts and impending bankruptcy; that Alyeska withheld funds admittedly owed knowing the effect this would have on plaintiffs and that plaintiffs had no alternative but to involuntarily accept the $97,500 in order to avoid bankruptcy. Plaintiffs maintained that they had thus raised genuine issues of material fact such that trial was necessary, and that Alyeska was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Alyeska disputed the plaintiffs’ assertions.</p>
<p id="03777d89-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On November 30, 1976, the superior court granted the defendant’s motion for summary judgment. This appeal followed. . . . </p>
<p id="03777d8a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>II</b></p>
<p id="0377a49b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As was noted above, a court’s initial task in deciding motions for summary judgment is to determine whether there exist genuine issues of material fact. In order to decide whether such issues exist in this case, we must examine the doctrine allowing avoidance of a release on grounds of economic duress.</p>
<p id="0377a49c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This court has not yet decided a case involving a claim of economic duress or what is also called business compulsion. At early common law, a contract could <span title="594" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-594">p. 594</span>be avoided on the ground of duress only if a party could show that the agreement was entered into for fear of loss of life or limb, mayhem or imprisonment. 13 Williston on Contracts, §1601 at 649 (3d ed. Jaeger 1970). The threat had to be such as to overcome the will of a person of ordinary firmness and courage. Id., §1602 at 656. Subsequently, however, the concept has been broadened to include myriad forms of economic coercion which force a person to involuntarily enter into a particular transaction. The test has come to be whether the will of the person induced by the threat was overcome rather than that of a reasonably firm person. Id., §1602 at 657.</p>
<p id="0377a49d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the outset it is helpful to acknowledge the various policy considerations which are involved in cases involving economic duress. Typically, those claiming such coercion are attempting to avoid the consequences of a modification of an original contract or of a settlement and release agreement. On the one hand, courts are reluctant to set aside agreements because of the notion of freedom of contract and because of the desirability of having private dispute resolutions be final. On the other hand, there is an increasing recognition of the law’s role in correcting inequitable or unequal exchanges between parties of disproportionate bargaining power and a greater willingness to not enforce agreements which were entered into under coercive circumstances.</p>
<p id="0377a49e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are various statements of what constitutes economic duress, but as noted by one commentator, “The history of generalization in this field offers no great encouragement for those who seek to summarize results in any single formula.” Dawson, Economic Duress—An Essay in Perspective, 45 Mich. L. Rev. 253, 289 (1947). Section 492(b) of the Restatement of Contracts defines duress as:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="0377a49f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">any wrongful threat of one person by words or other conduct that induces another to enter into a transaction under the influence of such fear as precludes him from exercising free will and judgment, if the threat was intended or should reasonably have been expected to operate as an inducement.</p>
</div>
<p id="0377a4a0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professor Williston states the basic elements of economic duress in the following manner:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-decimal">
<li class=""><p id="0377a4a1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The party alleging economic duress must show that he has been the victim of a wrongful or unlawful act or threat, and</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0377a4a2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Such act or threat must be one which deprives the victim of his unfettered will.</p></li>

<p id="0377a4a4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many courts state the test somewhat differently, eliminating use of the vague term “free will,” but retaining the same basic idea. Under this standard, duress exists where: (1) one party involuntarily accepted the terms of another, (2) circumstances permitted no other alternative, and (3) such circumstances were the result of coercive acts of the other party. . . . W. R. Grimshaw Co. v. Nevil C. Withrow Co., 248 F.2d 896, 904 (8th Cir. 1957). . . . The third element is further explained as follows:<span title="595" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-595">p. 595</span></p>

<p id="0377a4a5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In order to substantiate the allegation of economic duress or business compulsion, the plaintiff must go beyond the mere showing of reluctance to accept and of financial embarrassment. There must be a showing of acts on the part of the defendant which produced these two factors. The assertion of duress must be proven by evidence that the duress resulted from defendant’s wrongful and oppressive conduct and not by the plaintiff’s necessities.</p>

<p id="0377a4a7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the above indicates, one essential element of economic duress is that the plaintiff show that the other party by wrongful acts or threats, intentionally caused him to involuntarily enter into a particular transaction. Courts have not attempted to define exactly what constitutes a wrongful or coercive act, as wrongfulness depends on the particular facts in each case. This requirement may be satisfied where the alleged wrongdoer’s conduct is criminal or tortious but an act or threat may also be considered wrongful if it is wrongful in the moral sense. Restatement of Contracts §492, Comment <i>g</i>. . . . </p>
<p id="0377a4a8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In many cases, a threat to breach a contract or to withhold payment of an admitted debt has constituted a wrongful act. . . . Austin Instrument, Inc. v. Loral Corp., 29 N.Y.2d 124, 324 N.Y.S.2d 22, 25, 272 N.E.2d 533, 535 (1971); . . . see also 13 Williston, supra, §1616A at 701. Implicit in such cases is the additional requirement that the threat to breach the contract or withhold payment be done in bad faith. . . . Restatement (Second) of Contracts §318, Comment <i>e.</i></p>
<p id="0377cbb9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Economic duress does not exist, however, merely because a person has been the victim of a wrongful act; in addition, the victim must have no choice but to agree to the other party’s terms or face serious financial hardship. Thus, in order to avoid a contract, a party must also show that he had no reasonable alternative to agreeing to the other party’s terms, or, as it is often stated, that he had no adequate remedy if the threat were to be carried out. First National Bank of Cincinnati v. Pepper, 454 F.2d 626, 632-633 (2d Cir. 1972); <i>Austin Instrument,</i> supra, 324 N.Y.S.2d at 25, 272 N.E.2d at 535; . . . Tri-State Roofing Company of Uniontown v. Simon, 187 Pa. Super. 17, 142 A.2d 333, 335-336 (1958). What constitutes a reasonable alternative is a question of fact, depending on the circumstances of each case. An available legal remedy, such as an action for breach of contract, may provide such an alternative. <i>First National Bank of Cincinnati,</i> supra; <i>Austin Instrument,</i> supra; <i>Tri-State Roofing,</i> supra. Where one party wrongfully threatens to withhold goods, services or money from another unless certain demands are met, the availability on the market of similar goods and services or of other sources of funds may also provide an alternative to succumbing to the coercing party’s demands. <i>Austin Instrument,</i> supra; <i>Tri-State Roofing,</i> supra. Generally, it has been said that “[t]he adequacy of the remedy is to be tested by a practical standard which takes into consideration the exigencies of the situation in which the alleged victim finds himself.” Ross Systems [v. Linden Dari-Delite, Inc., 35 N.J. 329, 173 A.2d 258, 262 (1961)]. See also <i>First National Bank of Cincinnati,</i> supra at 634; Dalzell, Duress By Economic Pressure I, 20 N.C.L.

For example, in <i>Austin Instrument,</i> supra, and Gallagher Switchboard Corp. v. Heckler Electric Co., 36 Misc. 2d 225, 232 N.Y.S.2d 590 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1962), duress was found in the following circumstances: A subcontractor threatened to refuse further delivery under a contract unless the contractor agreed to modify the existing contract between the parties. The contractor was unable to obtain the necessary materials elsewhere without delay, and if it did not have the materials promptly, it would have been in default on its main contract with the government. In each case such default would have had grave economic consequences for the contractor and hence it agreed to the modifications. In both, the courts found that the alternatives to agreeing to the modification were inadequate (i.e., suing for breach of contract or obtaining the materials elsewhere) and that modifications therefore were signed under duress and voidable.</p>
<p id="0377cbbb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professor Dalzell, in Duress By Economic Pressure II, 20 N.C.L. Rev. 340, 370 (1942), notes the following with regard to the adequacy of legal remedies where one party refuses to pay a contract claim:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="0377cbbc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nowadays, a wait of even a few weeks in collecting on a contract claim is sometimes serious or fatal for an enterprise at a crisis in its history. The business of a creditor in financial straits is at the mercy of an unscrupulous debtor, who need only suggest that if the creditor does not care to settle on the debtor’s own hard terms, he can sue. This situation, in which promptness in payment is vastly more important than even approximate justice in the settlement terms, is too common in modern business relations to be ignored by society and the courts.</p>
</div>
<p id="0377cbbd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This view finds support in Capps v. Georgia Pacific Corporation, 253 Or. 248, 453 P.2d 935 (1969). There, the plaintiff was owed $157,000 as a commission for finding a lessee for defendant’s property but in exchange for $5,000, the plaintiff signed a release of his claim against defendant. The plaintiff sued for the balance of the commission, alleging that the release had been executed under duress. His complaint, however, was dismissed. On appeal, the court held that the plaintiff had stated a claim where he alleged that he had accepted the grossly inadequate sum because he was in danger of immediately losing his home by mortgage foreclosure and other property by foreclosure and repossession if he did not obtain immediate funds from the defendant. One basis for its holding was found in the following quote by a leading commentator in the area of economic duress:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="0377cbbe-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The most that can be claimed [regarding the law of economic duress] is that change has been broadly toward acceptance of a general conclusion—that in the absence of specific countervailing factors of policy or administrative feasibility, restitution is required of any excessive gain that results, in a bargain transaction, from impaired bargaining power, whether the impairment consists of economic necessity, mental or physical disability, or a wide disparity in knowledge or experience.</p>

Totem has alleged that Alyeska deliberately withheld payment of an acknowledged debt, knowing that Totem had no choice but to accept an inadequate sum in settlement of that debt; that Totem was faced with impending bankruptcy; that Totem was unable to meet its pressing debts other than by accepting the immediate cash payment offered by Alyeska; and that through necessity, Totem thus involuntarily accepted an inadequate settlement offer from Alyeska and executed a release of all claims under the contract. If the release was in fact executed under these circumstances,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10501_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10501_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">5</a></span> we think that under the legal principles discussed above that this would constitute the type of wrongful conduct and lack of alternatives that would render the release voidable by Totem on the ground of economic duress. We would add that although Totem need not necessarily prove its allegation that Alyeska’s termination of the contract was wrongful in order to sustain a claim of economic duress, the events leading to the termination would be probative as to whether Alyeska exerted any wrongful pressure on Totem and whether Alyeska wrongfully withheld payment from Totem.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10507_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10507_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">6</a></span> . . . </p>
<p id="0377cbc4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our examination of the materials presented by Totem in opposition to Alyeska’s motion for summary judgment leads us to conclude that Totem has made a sufficient factual showing as to each of the elements of economic duress to withstand that motion. There is no doubt that Alyeska disputes many of the factual allegations made by Totem<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10511_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10511_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">7</a></span> and drawing all inferences in favor of Totem, we believe that genuine issues of material fact exist in this case such that trial is necessary. Admittedly, Totem’s showing was somewhat weak in that, for example, it did not produce the testimony of Roy Bell, the attorney who represented Totem in the negotiations leading to the settlement and release. At trial, it will probably be necessary for Totem to produce this evidence if it is to prevail on its claim of duress. However, a party opposing a motion for summary judgment need not produce all of the evidence it may have at its disposal but need only show that issues of material fact exist. 10 C. Wright and A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil, §2727 at 546 (1973).

<li class=""><p id="0377f2d9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Void vs. voidable contracts.</i> As noted by the <i>Totem Marine</i> court, duress had its origin in cases in which a party manifested assent as a result of a threat to life or limb, mayhem, or imprisonment. The Restatement (Second) recognizes that a contract is <i>void</i> if made under physical compulsion, so that a person is compelled by “actual physical force” to appear to sign a contract or otherwise manifest assent. Restatement (Second) §174, Comment <i>a.</i> Some courts, however, have recognized more broadly that coercion involving a threat of physical harm may also result in ineffectual assent and a void contract. In Everbank v. Marini, 134 A.3d 189 (Vt. 2015), a husband called his wife and two children to the kitchen table and waved around a large pair of scissors while “berating” the wife about her refusal to sign a mortgage application. The Vermont Supreme Court held that “physical compulsion” sufficient to render a contract void would include “a threat of imminent physical violence” to get a person to sign a document, even though the Restatement (Second) §174 would deem such a contract only voidable. Id. at 200. But see Shultz v. Shultz, 867 So. 2d 745 (La. Ct. App. 2003) (reversing trial court and finding duress was not established in signing child support reduction agreement where claimant feared ex-husband as violent man and wanted to avoid argument but there was no evidence of use of force or threats).</p>
<p id="0377f2da-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is presently more common that a party claims to be the victim of economic coercion, as in <i>Totem Marine</i>, rather than physical compulsion or a threat of physical harm<i>.</i> Contracts made under economic duress are deemed voidable rather than void. Thus, such contracts will be binding unless disaffirmed and may be expressly or implicitly ratified by the purported victim. See, e.g., Hyman v. Ford Motor Co., 142 F. Supp. 2d 735 (D.S.C. 2001) (contract executed under duress may be ratified by acceptance of benefits, remaining silent after opportunity to disavow, or rendering performance).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0377f2db-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Wrongful or improper threat.</i> Faced with a question of first impression, the <i>Totem Marine</i> court cited a number of authorities in arriving at a definition of economic duress. Consistent with the Restatement (Second) §175, the court’s test can be viewed as requiring three elements: a wrongful or improper threat, a lack of reasonable alternative, and actual inducement of the contract by the threat. Restatement (Second) §§175 and 176 use the term “improper threat” while courts such as <i>Totem Marine</i> will often use the term “wrongful” to describe an actionable threat. More important than the use of either particular term is the fact the threat need not be “illegal” in order to give rise to a claim of duress. See Quigley v. KPMG Peat Marwick, LLP, 749 A.2d 405 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2000) (threat that establishes duress may be wrongful in moral or <span title="599" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-599">p. 599</span>equitable sense even if not illegal). But see Whirlpool Corp. v. Grigoleit Co., 713 F.3d 316 (6th Cir. 2013) (under Michigan law duress requires showing of illegal compulsion or coercion).</p>
<p id="0377f2dc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When is a threat wrongful or improper? The Restatement (Second) §176 definition includes threats to commit a crime or tort and threats of criminal prosecution. While threats to engage in litigation or to refuse to honor a contractual obligation are not per se improper, such threats may be improper if the circumstances show that the threat was made in “bad faith.” Id. §176(1)(c), (d). See also Kelso v. McGowan, 604 So. 2d 726 (Miss. 1992) (threat to breach enforceable contract can constitute “wrongful” act); but cf. Professional Service Network, Inc. v. American Alliance Holding Co., 238 F.3d 897 (7th Cir. 2001) (not an improper threat for seller of stock to insist on settlement of dispute under the contract before cooperating in tax filing worth $5 million to buyer; seller had “colorable case” and its position was not frivolous). What was the threat in the <i>Totem Marine</i> case? How could the plaintiff establish that the threat was made in bad faith?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0377f2dd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Economic duress and market change.</i> Because of market changes, a party might find itself in the position to dictate to the other party conditions that are extremely unfavorable to the weaker party. For example, in a “seller’s market” a supplier might impose a dramatic price increase on a buyer for whom a certain product is essential. Cabot Corp. v. AVX Corp., 863 N.E.2d 503 (Mass. 2007), dealt with the enforceability of a long-term supply contract. In 2001, AVX agreed to a long-term supply contract with Cabot when Cabot threatened to refuse to supply AVX with tantalum under letters of intent previously agreed between the parties. AVX subsequently sued to invalidate the contract on the ground of economic duress. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court recognized that Cabot had a superior bargaining position with regard to the 2001 contract, but it rejected the claim that this amounted to economic duress: “[T]he strength of Cabot’s bargaining position in negotiating the supply contract, as well as AVX’s weakened position, were the result of a worldwide shortage of the rare tantalum product. . . .” Id. at 512. The case stands for the proposition that a party’s use of increased bargaining power resulting from dramatic changes in the market does not amount to economic duress. Professor Crystal and Francesca Giannoni-Crystal have analyzed the legal grounds for invalidation of contracts because of dramatic market change under both the common law and international contract principles (the CISG and UNIDROIT Principles). They conclude that the common law is very unlikely to provide relief, but international principles may be somewhat more receptive to such claims. Instead, lawyers should protect their clients from dramatic market change by appropriate contractual provisions. See Nathan M. Crystal &amp; Francesca Giannoni-Crystal, <i>Contract Enforceability During Economic Crisis: Legal Principles and Drafting Solutions,</i> Global Jurist: Vol. 10: Iss. 3 (Advances), available at: http://www .bepress.com/gj/vol10/iss3/art3.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0377f2de-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Threat of criminal proceedings.</i> A threat by an attorney to institute criminal proceedings in order to aid a client in a civil dispute may not only render any resulting agreement unenforceable because of duress but may also subject <span title="600" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-600">p. 600</span>the attorney to discipline because of professional misconduct. Such threats may amount to extortion under state criminal statutes and could also be found to be unethical under general ethical concepts. E.g., ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.2(d) (lawyer may not counsel or assist a client in conduct that is criminal or fraudulent); Model Rule 4.4 (respect for rights of third persons). In addition, some states have modified the ABA’s Model Rules to prohibit using threats of criminal proceedings to obtain an advantage in a civil matter. E.g., S.C. R. Prof. Cond. 4.5.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0377f2df-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Lack of reasonable alternative.</i> Even if a threat is improper, the resulting agreement is enforceable unless the party who submitted to the agreement had no reasonable alternative but to accept the agreement. Comment <i>b</i> to §175 of the Restatement (Second) indicates a number of possible reasonable alternatives: the availability of legal action if, in the circumstances, that course presents a viable option; alternative sources of goods, services, or funds when there is a threat to withhold such things; and toleration if the threat involves only a minor vexation. Compare Uniwill v. City of Los Angeles, 21 Cal. Rptr. 3d 464 (Ct. App. 2004) (developer of shopping mall stated viable claim for economic duress in alleging that city and electric company wrongfully threatened to stop project unless easement was granted and resort to legal proceedings would have led to financial ruin), with Dunes Hospitality, L.L.C. v. Country Kitchen Int’l, Inc., 623 N.W.2d 484 (S.D. 2001) (no duress where claimant company included sophisticated principals, had assistance of counsel, and had reasonable alternative of filing lawsuit rather than signing settlement agreement). In Reliford v. United Parcel Service, 2008 WL 4865987 (N.D. Ill.), the plaintiff employee was held to have sufficiently pled facts showing his release of age discrimination claims for only a $200 payment was procured by economic duress where he feared the loss of health benefits necessary to preserve his wife’s life if he chose to litigate the claims.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0377f2e0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Inducement of involuntary assent.</i> The <i>Totem Marine</i> court would also require a showing that the wrongful threat “caused” the victim to involuntarily enter into the transaction. Consistently, Comment <i>c</i> to Restatement (Second) of Contracts §175 states that “the improper threat must induce the making of the contract,” meaning that the threat must “substantially contribute” to the manifestation of assent. (This requirement suggests, at least implicitly, that the victim of the threat might have additional reasons for manifesting assent to the agreement.) Despite earlier standards that required the threat be “such as to overcome the will of a person of ordinary firmness and courage,” as stated in <i>Totem Marine</i>, the standard is now a subjective one that asks whether the particular victim was induced by the threat. Comment <i>c</i> goes on to state that “[a]ll attendant circumstances must be considered, including such matters as the age, background and relationship of the parties.” See Holler v. Holler, 612 S.E.2d 469 (S.C. Ct. App. 2005) (immigrant wife who spoke little English, had no means of financial self-support, was pregnant, and had visa that was about to expire stated good claim for duress in signing prenuptial agreement as demanded by husband before marriage). For a feminist critique of the current scope of the duress doctrine, see Orit <span title="601" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-601">p. 601</span>Gan, Contractual Duress and Relations of Power, 36 Harv. J.L. Gender 171 (2013).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0377f2e1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Must threatening party cause hardship?</i> A question which frequently arises is the role that an alleged victim’s financial difficulty plays in the determination of economic duress. In Selmer Co. v. Blakeslee-Midwest Co., 704 F.2d 924 (7th Cir. 1983), Judge Posner stated that the fact a party agreed to a settlement because of a desperate need for cash could not be the basis for duress unless the other side had caused the financial hardship. The judge further observed that the inability of parties in dire straits to enter into enforceable agreements could cause other parties to refuse to settle even when both sides wanted to do so, thus ultimately working to the detriment of the alleged victim. Id. at 928. Most courts that have faced the issue agree with <i>Selmer.</i> Indeed, the Alaska Supreme Court that decided <i>Totem Marine</i> later adopted this view. Northern Fabrication Co. v. UNOCAL, 980 P.2d 958 (Alaska 1999) (for economic duress there must be a causal link between coercive acts and circumstances of economic duress).</p>
<p id="0377f2e2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, a few courts have held, sometimes implicitly, that it is enough that one party takes advantage of the other side’s dire circumstances without having caused the financial hardship. See, e.g., Advanced Cleanup Technologies, Inc. v. BP America, 2016 WL 67671 (C.D. Cal.) (plaintiff adequately pled economic duress when defendant made “take it or leave it” offer of $1.4 million to settle invoices for $3.2 million in emergency services to clean up massive Deepwater Horizon oil spill, taking “wrongful” advantage of fact that plaintiff was facing financial ruin or bankruptcy); Butitta v. First Mortgage Corp., 578 N.E.2d 116 (Ill. App. Ct. 1991) (duress may consist of taking undue advantage of the business or financial stress of the other party).</p></li>

<p id="0377f2e9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appeal from a judgment dismissing plaintiff’s amended complaint on demurrer.</p>
<p id="037819fa-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff Donald Odorizzi was employed during 1964 as an elementary school teacher by defendant Bloomfield School District and was under contract with the District to continue to teach school the following year as a permanent employee. On June 10 he was arrested on criminal charges of homosexual activity, and on June 11 he signed and delivered to his superiors his written resignation as a teacher, a resignation which the District accepted on June 13. In July the criminal charges against Odorizzi were dismissed under Penal Code, section 995, and in September he sought to resume his employment with the District. On the District’s refusal to reinstate him he filed suit for declaratory and other relief.</p>
<p id="037819fb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Odorizzi’s amended complaint asserts his resignation was invalid because obtained through duress, fraud, mistake, and undue influence and given at a <span title="602" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-602">p. 602</span>time when he lacked capacity to make a valid contract. Specifically, Odorizzi declares he was under such severe mental and emotional strain at the time he signed his resignation, having just completed the process of arrest, questioning by the police, booking, and release on bail, and having gone for forty hours without sleep, that he was incapable of rational thought or action. While he was in this condition and unable to think clearly, the superintendent of the District and the principal of his school came to his apartment. They said they were trying to help him and had his best interests at heart, that he should take their advice and immediately resign his position with the District, that there was no time to consult an attorney, that if he did not resign immediately the District would suspend and dismiss him from his position and publicize the proceedings, his “aforedescribed arrest” and cause him “to suffer extreme embarrassment and humiliation”; but that if he resigned at once the incident would not be publicized and would not jeopardize his chances of securing employment as a teacher elsewhere. Odorizzi pleads that because of his faith and confidence in their representations they were able to substitute their will and judgment in place of his own and thus obtain his signature to his purported resignation. A demurrer to his amended complaint was sustained without leave to amend.</p>
<p id="037819fc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By his complaint plaintiff in effect seeks to rescind his resignation pursuant to Civil Code, section 1689, on the ground that his consent had not been real or free within the meaning of Civil Code, section 1567, but had been obtained through duress, menace, fraud, undue influence, or mistake. A pleading under these sections is sufficient if stripped of its conclusions, it sets forth sufficient facts to justify legal relief. . . . In our view the facts in the amended complaint are insufficient to state a cause of action for duress, menace, fraud, or mistake, but they do set out sufficient elements to justify rescission of a consent because of undue influence. We summarize our conclusions on each of these points.</p>
<p id="037819fd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">1. No duress or menace has been pleaded. Duress consists in unlawful confinement of another’s person, or relatives, or property, which causes him to consent to a transaction through fear. (Civ. Code, §1569.) Duress is often used interchangeably with menace . . . but in California menace is technically a threat of duress or a threat of injury to the person, property, or character of another. (Civ. Code, §1570; Restatement, Contracts, §§492, 493.) We agree with respondent’s contention that neither duress nor menace was involved in this case, because the action or threat in duress or menace must be unlawful, and a threat to take legal action is not unlawful unless the party making the threat knows the falsity of his claim. (Leeper v. Beltrami, 53 Cal. 2d 195, 204, 1 Cal. Rptr. 12, 347 P.2d 12, 77 A.L.R.2d 803.) The amended complaint shows in substance that the school representatives announced their intention to initiate suspension and dismissal proceedings under Education Code, sections 13403, 13408 et seq. at a time when the filing of such proceedings was not only their legal right but their positive duty as school officials. (Educ. Code, §13409; Board of Education, etc. v. Weiland, 179 Cal. App. 2d 808, 4 Cal. Rptr. 286.) Although the filing of such proceedings might be extremely damaging to plaintiff’s reputation, the injury would remain incidental so long as the school officials acted in good faith in the performance of their duties. (Schumm by Whymer v. Berg, <span title="603" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-603">p. 603</span>37 Cal. 2d 174, 185-186, 231 P.2d 39, 21 A.L.R.2d 1051.) Neither duress nor menace was present as a ground for rescission.</p>
<p id="037819fe-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">2. Nor do we find a cause of action for fraud, either actual or constructive. (Civ. Code, §§1571 to 1574.) Actual fraud involves conscious misrepresentation, or concealment, or non-disclosure of a material fact which induces the innocent party to enter the contract. (Civ. Code, §1572; Pearson v. Norton, 230 Cal. App. 2d 1, 7, 40 Cal. Rptr. 634; Restatement, Contracts, §471.) A complaint for fraud must plead misrepresentation, knowledge of falsity, intent to induce reliance, justifiable reliance, and resulting damage. (Sixta v. Ochsner, 187 Cal. App. 2d 485, 489, 9 Cal. Rptr. 617; Zinn v. Ex-Cell-O Corp., 148 Cal. App. 2d 56, 68, 306 P.2d 1017.) While the amended complaint charged misrepresentation, it failed to assert the elements of knowledge of falsity, intent to induce reliance, and justifiable reliance. A cause of action for actual fraud was therefore not stated. . . . </p>
<p id="037819ff-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Constructive fraud arises on a breach of duty by one in a confidential or fiduciary relationship to another which induces justifiable reliance by the latter to his prejudice. (Civ. Code, §1573.) Plaintiff has attempted to bring himself within this category, for the amended complaint asserts the existence of a confidential relationship between the school superintendent and principal as agents of the defendant, and the plaintiff. Such a confidential relationship may exist whenever a person with justification places trust and confidence in the integrity and fidelity of another. . . . Plaintiff, however, sets forth no facts to support his conclusion of a confidential relationship between the representatives of the school district and himself, other than that the parties bore the relationship of employer and employee to each other. Under prevailing judicial opinion no presumption of a confidential relationship arises from the bare fact that parties to a contract are employer and employee; rather, additional ties must be brought out in order to create the presumption of a confidential relationship between the two. . . . The absence of a confidential relationship between employer and employee is especially apparent where, as here, the parties were negotiating to bring about a termination of their relationship. In such a situation each party is expected to look after his own interests, and a lack of confidentiality is implicit in the subject matter of their dealings. We think the allegations of constructive fraud were inadequate.</p>
<p id="03781a00-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">3. As to mistake, the amended complaint fails to disclose any facts which would suggest that consent had been obtained through a mistake of fact or of law. The material facts of the transaction were known to both parties. Neither party was laboring under any misapprehension of law of which the other took advantage. The discussion between plaintiff and the school district representatives principally attempted to evaluate the probable consequences of plaintiff’s predicament and to predict the future course of events. The fact that their speculations did not forecast the exact pattern which events subsequently took does not provide the basis for a claim that they were acting under some sort of mistake. The doctrine of mistake customarily involves such errors as the nature of the transaction, the identity of the parties, the identity of the things to which the contract relates, or the occurrence of collateral happenings. (Restatement, <span title="604" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-604">p. 604</span>Contracts §502, Comment <i>e.</i>) Errors of this nature were not present in the case at bench.</p>
<p id="03781a01-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">4. However, the pleading does set out a claim that plaintiff’s consent to the transaction had been obtained through the use of undue influence.</p>
<p id="03781a02-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Undue influence, in the sense we are concerned with here, is a shorthand legal phrase used to describe persuasion which tends to be coercive in nature, persuasion which overcomes the will without convincing the judgment. (Estate of Ricks, 160 Cal. 467, 480-482, 117 P. 539.) The hallmark of such persuasion is high pressure, a pressure which works on mental, moral, or emotional weakness to such an extent that it approaches the boundaries of coercion. In this sense, undue influence has been called overpersuasion. (Kelly v. McCarthy, 6 Cal. 2d 347, 364, 57 P.2d 118.) Misrepresentations of law or fact are not essential to the charge, for a person’s will may be overborne without misrepresentation. By statutory definition undue influence includes “taking an unfair advantage of another’s weakness of mind; or . . . taking a grossly oppressive and unfair advantage of another’s necessities or distress.” (Civ. Code, §1575.) While most reported cases of undue influence involve persons who bear a confidential relationship to one another, a confidential or authoritative relationship between the parties need not be present when the undue influence involves unfair advantage taken of another’s weakness or distress. . . . </p>
<p id="03781a03-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We paraphrase the summary of undue influence given the jury by Sir James P. Wilde in Hall v. Hall, L.R. 1, P &amp; D 481, 482 (1868): To make a good contract a man must be a free agent. Pressure of whatever sort which overpowers the will without convincing the judgment is a species of restraint under which no valid contract can be made. Importunity or threats, if carried to the degree in which the free play of a man’s will is overborne, constitute undue influence, although no force is used or threatened. A party may be led but not driven, and his acts must be the offspring of his own volition and not the record of someone else’s.</p>
<p id="03781a04-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In essence undue influence involves the use of excessive pressure to persuade one vulnerable to such pressure, pressure applied by a dominant subject to a servient object. In combination, the elements of undue susceptibility in the servient person and excessive pressure by the dominating person make the latter’s influence undue, for it results in the apparent will of the servient person being in fact the will of the dominant person.</p>
<p id="03781a05-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Undue susceptibility may consist of total weakness of mind which leaves a person entirely without understanding (Civ. Code, §38); or, a lesser weakness which destroys the capacity of a person to make a contract even though he is not totally incapacitated (Civ. Code, §39; Peterson v. Ellebrecht, 205 Cal. App. 2d 718, 721-722, 23 Cal. Rptr. 349); or, the first element in our equation, a still lesser weakness which provides sufficient grounds to rescind a contract for undue influence (Civ. Code, §1575; . . .). Such lesser weakness need not be longlasting nor wholly incapacitating, but may be merely a lack of full vigor due to age, . . . physical condition, . . . emotional anguish, . . . or a combination of such factors. The reported cases have usually involved elderly, sick, senile persons alleged to have executed wills or deeds under pressure. (Malone v. Malone, <span title="605" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-605">p. 605</span>155 Cal. App. 2d 161, 317 P.2d 65 [constant importuning of a senile husband]; Stewart v. Marvin, 139 Cal. App. 2d 769, 294 P.2d 114 [persistent nagging of elderly spouse].) In some of its aspects this lesser weakness could perhaps be called weakness of spirit. But whatever name we give it, this first element of undue influence resolves itself into a lessened capacity of the object to make a free contract.</p>
<p id="03781a06-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the present case plaintiff has pleaded that such weakness at the time he signed his resignation prevented him from freely and competently applying his judgment to the problem before him. Plaintiff declares he was under severe mental and emotional strain at the time because he had just completed the process of arrest, questioning, booking, and release on bail and had been without sleep for forty hours. It is possible that exhaustion and emotional turmoil may wholly incapacitate a person from exercising his judgment. As an abstract question of pleading, plaintiff has pleaded that possibility and sufficient allegations to state a case for rescission.</p>
<p id="03781a07-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Undue influence in its second aspect involves an application of excessive strength by a dominant subject against a servient object. Judicial consideration of this second element in undue influence has been relatively rare, for there are few cases denying persons who persuade but do not misrepresent the benefit of their bargain. Yet logically, the same legal consequences should apply to the results of excessive strength as to the results of undue weakness. Whether from weakness on one side, or strength on the other, or a combination of the two, undue influence occurs whenever there results “that kind of influence or supremacy of one mind over another by which that other is prevented from acting according to his own wish or judgment, and whereby the will of the person is overborne and he is induced to do or forbear to do an act which he would not do, or would do, if left to act freely.” (Webb v. Saunders, 79 Cal. App. 2d 863, 871, 181 P.2d 43, 47.) Undue influence involves a type of mismatch which our statute calls unfair advantage. (Civ. Code, §1575.) Whether a person of subnormal capacities has been subjected to ordinary force or a person of normal capacities subjected to extraordinary force, the match is equally out of balance. If will has been overcome against judgment, consent may be rescinded.</p>
<p id="03781a08-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The difficulty, of course, lies in determining when the forces of persuasion have overflowed their normal banks and become oppressive flood waters. There are second thoughts to every bargain, and hindsight is still better than foresight. Undue influence cannot be used as a pretext to avoid bad bargains or escape from bargains which refuse to come up to expectations. A woman who buys a dress on impulse, which on critical inspection by her best friend turns out to be less fashionable than she had thought, is not legally entitled to set aside the sale on the ground that the saleswoman used all her wiles to close the sale. A man who buys a tract of desert land in the expectation that it is in the immediate path of the city’s growth and will become another Palm Springs, an expectation cultivated in glowing terms by the seller, cannot rescind his bargain when things turn out differently. If we are temporarily persuaded against our better judgment to do something about which we later have second thoughts, we <span title="606" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-606">p. 606</span>must abide the consequences of the risks inherent in managing our own affairs. (Estate of Anderson, 185 Cal. 700, 706-707, 198 P. 407.)</p>
<p id="03781a09-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, overpersuasion is generally accompanied by certain characteristics which tend to create a pattern. The pattern usually involves several of the following elements: (1) discussion of the transaction at an unusual or inappropriate time, (2) consummation of the transaction in an unusual place, (3) insistent demand that the business be finished at once, (4) extreme emphasis on untoward consequences of delay, (5) the use of multiple persuaders by the dominant side against a single servient party, (6) absence of third-party advisers to the servient party, (7) statements that there is no time to consult financial advisers or attorneys. If a number of these elements are simultaneously present, the persuasion may be characterized as excessive. The cases are illustrative:</p>
<p id="03781a0a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moore v. Moore, 56 Cal. 89, 93, and 81 Cal. 195, 22 P. 589, 874. The pregnant wife of a man who had been shot to death on October 30 and buried on November 1 was approached by four members of her husband’s family on November 2 or 3 and persuaded to deed her entire interest in her husband’s estate to his children by a prior marriage. In finding the use of undue influence on Mrs. Moore, the court commented: “It was the second day after her late husband’s funeral. It was at a time when she would naturally feel averse to transacting any business, and she might reasonably presume that her late husband’s brother would not apply to her at such a time to transact any important business, unless it was of a nature that would admit of no delay. And as it would admit of delay, the only reason which we can discover for their unseemly haste is, that they thought that she would be more likely to comply with their wishes then than at some future time, after she had recovered from the shock which she had then so recently experienced. If for that reason they selected that time for the accomplishment of their purpose, it seems to us that they not only took, but that they designed to take, an unfair advantage of her weakness of mind. If they did not, they probably can explain why they selected that inappropriate time for the transaction of business which might have been delayed for weeks without injury to any one. In the absence of any explanation, it appears to us that the time was selected with reference to just that condition of mind which she alleges that she was then in.</p>
<p id="03781a0b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Taking an unfair advantage of another’s weakness of mind is undue influence, and the law will not permit the retention of an advantage thus obtained.” (Civ. Code, §1575.)</p>
<p id="03781a0c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Weger v. Rocha, 138 Cal. App. 109, 32 P.2d 417. Plaintiff, while confined in a cast in a hospital, gave a release of claims for personal injuries for a relatively small sum to an agent who spent two hours persuading her to sign. At the time of signing plaintiff was in a highly nervous and hysterical condition and suffering much pain, and she signed the release in order to terminate the interview. The court held that the release had been secured by the use of undue influence. . . . </p>
<p id="03781a0d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The difference between legitimate persuasion and excessive pressure, like the difference between seduction and rape, rests to a considerable extent in the manner in which the parties go about their business. For example, if a day <span title="607" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-607">p. 607</span>or two after Odorizzi’s release on bail the superintendent of the school district had called him into his office during business hours and directed his attention to those provisions of the Education Code compelling his leave of absence and authorizing his suspension on the filing of written charges, had told him that the District contemplated filing written charges against him, had pointed out the alternative of resignation available to him, had informed him he was free to consult counsel or any adviser he wished and to consider the matter overnight and return with his decision the next day, it is extremely unlikely that any complaint about the use of excessive pressure could ever have been made against the school district.</p>
<p id="03781a0e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But, according to the allegations of the complaint, this is not the way it happened, and if it had happened that way, plaintiff would never have resigned. Rather, the representatives of the school board undertook to achieve their objective by overpersuasion and imposition to secure plaintiff’s signature but not his consent to his resignation through a high-pressure carrot-and-stick technique—under which they assured plaintiff they were trying to assist him, he should rely on their advice, there wasn’t time to consult an attorney, if he didn’t resign at once the school district would suspend and dismiss him from his position and publicize the proceedings, but if he did resign the incident wouldn’t jeopardize his chances of securing a teaching post elsewhere.</p>
<p id="03781a0f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff has thus pleaded both subjective and objective elements entering the undue influence equation and stated sufficient facts to put in issue the question whether his free will had been overborne by defendant’s agents at a time when he was unable to function in a normal manner. It was sufficient to pose “. . . the ultimate question . . . whether a free and competent judgment was merely influenced, or whether a mind was so dominated as to prevent the exercise of an independent judgment.” (Williston on Contracts, §1625 [rev. ed.]; Restatement, Contracts §497, Comment <i>c.</i>) The question cannot be resolved by an analysis of pleading but requires a finding of fact.</p>
<p id="03784020-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We express no opinion on the merits of plaintiff’s case, or the propriety of his continuing to teach school (Educ. Code, §13403), or the timeliness of his rescission (Civ. Code, §1691). We do hold that his pleading, liberally construed, states a cause of action for rescission of a transaction to which his apparent consent had been obtained through the use of undue influence.</p>

<li class=""><p id="03784025-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Defining undue influence.</i> The <i>Odorizzi</i> court identifies the essence of undue influence as involving the use of excessive pressure by a dominant party in overcoming the will of a vulnerable person. Similarly, the Restatement (Second) §177(1) describes undue influence as involving “unfair persuasion of a party who is under the domination of the person exercising the persuasion or who by virtue of the relation between them is justified in assuming that <span title="608" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-608">p. 608</span>that person will not act in a manner inconsistent with his welfare.” Although neither the <i>Odorizzi</i> court nor the Restatement (Second) requires the presence of a special relationship, such a finding will often be a significant factor in a court’s assessment of undue influence. See, e.g., In re Estate of Jones, 287 P.3d 610 (Wash. Ct. App. 2012) (existence of fiduciary relationship creates rebuttable presumption of undue influence). The mere fact that parties have a close relationship, however, or that some influence is exerted, will not necessarily prove undue influence. See, e.g., Robertson v. Robertson, 15 S.W.3d 407 (Mo. Ct. App. 2000) (even though defendant held special relationship of confidence and trust as farm manager for elderly grantor and the challenged deed recited price of $100 paid for land worth between $100,000 and $250,000, plaintiffs raised only suspicion of undue influence and presented no actual proof).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03784026-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Factors indicating undue influence.</i> As an aid to applying the general concept of undue influence, the <i>Odorizzi</i> court identifies seven characteristics that are often found in such cases. Should all of the seven elements be required to find a contract tainted by undue influence? In Keithley v. Civil Service Board, 89 Cal. Rptr. 809 (Ct. App. 1970), a police officer’s resignation from the force was held to have been coerced, and therefore unlawful, despite the absence of the factors numbered (4) and (7) in the <i>Odorizzi</i> opinion. The officer had been charged with rape by a woman — not his wife — with whom he admitted having intercourse, but with her consent, not by force. The court’s opinion observed that the officer had not slept for 24 hours, that he was called to police headquarters for three successive days, and that on the third day was questioned by a superior officer who emphasized that the charges should not be made public. The court concluded that there was substantial evidence of undue influence. Id. at 815. More recently, in Kelly v. Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., 734 F. Supp. 2d 1085 (S.D. Cal. 2010), a California federal court held that even if none of the <i>Odorizzi</i> factors was present, a plaintiff could establish his claim for rescission based on undue influence where he was suffering from mental illness known to the defendant insurer, and defendant conducted an investigation in bad faith and engaged in other harassing activity to pressure him into dropping his disability claim.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03784027-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Assessing Odorizzi for possible duress.</i> You will note that duress as defined by the court in <i>Odorizzi</i> is substantially narrower than the second Restatement’s concept of duress. Subsequent California decisions indicate that the doctrine has evolved under state law to now encompass wrongful threats that leave the victim without reasonable alternatives. See Rich &amp; Whillock v. Ashton Development, Inc., 204 Cal. Rptr. 86, 89 (Ct. App. 1984). Could the plaintiff’s resignation in <i>Odorizzi</i> have been rescinded under a more contemporary definition of duress? In what respect could undue influence be easier to establish than duress? How might it be more difficult?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03784028-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Role of bad faith.</i> Does the decision in <i>Odorizzi</i> depend on whether the school officials honestly believed the charges were likely to be upheld? The court’s opinion indicates that the charges originally lodged against Odorizzi were dropped the following month, but the court does not state the reasons for that action. Suppose when the school officials urged Odorizzi to resign, <span title="609" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-609">p. 609</span>they had proceeded as the court in <i>Odorizzi</i> indicates they should have, giving him time to consider their proposition and advising him to seek legal counsel before deciding. If you had been consulted by Odorizzi at that time, what advice would you have given?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03784029-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Undue influence and duress in agreements related to marriage.</i> In a category of cases that combine economic interests and personal relationships, claims of duress and undue influence have been used to challenge prenuptial as well as marriage dissolution agreements. A notable example is In re Bonds, 5 P.3d 815 (Cal. 2000), in which Sun Bonds, the former wife of professional baseball player Barry Bonds, challenged the validity of their premarital agreement which provided that each party waived any interest in the earnings made by the other party during the marriage. The contract was signed the day before the marriage, only Barry had assistance of counsel, and English was not Sun’s first language. Nevertheless, the trial court held that the agreement was enforceable, basing its decision on findings that Sun had not been subject to any threat or coercion, that she had been advised that she could seek counsel, and that there was substantial evidence that she understood the agreement. Id. at 834-36. The California Supreme Court upheld the trial court’s decision, noting that the applicable Family Code provisions placed the burden of proof on Sun to demonstrate that the agreement was not voluntarily made and that the absence of counsel was not decisive. Id. at 829. Notably, the California Legislature responded to the <i>Bonds</i> decision by amending the statute to provide that a premarital agreement is not voluntary if a party is not represented by counsel when signing the agreement, unless that party waives the right to independent counsel “in a separate writing.” See Cal. Fam. Code §1615(c)(1).</p>
<p id="0378402a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prenuptial agreements continue to be the basis of a significant amount of litigation. See Ellis v. Ellis, 2014 Tenn. Lexis App. 760 (Tenn. Ct. App.) (holding that prenuptial agreement was unenforceable where the husband failed to reveal holdings that were valued at $4,750,000; the wife did not have independent knowledge of the full nature, extent, and value of the husband’s property and holdings; and the agreement was presented to the wife three days before the wedding and two days before Christmas, which gave the wife no reasonable opportunity to consult with independent counsel). Similar issues may also arise with regard to “postnuptial” or “marital agreements.” See also Golding v. Golding, 581 N.Y.S.2d 4 (App. Div. 1992) (settlement agreement was voidable on basis of duress in light of husband’s threat not to grant “Get” or Jewish divorce and wife’s fears based on sister’s failure to obtain “Get” in earlier divorce).</p>

<p id="03786744-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Early in the history of the common law, with rare exceptions, the English courts did not generally recognize fraud as a defense to an action in assumpsit. The courts did provide indirect relief, however, by allowing recovery for damages flowing from fraud in a separate action, which later came to be known as the tort action of “deceit.” The modern tort action for misrepresentation is a descendent of this common law remedy.</p>
<p id="03786745-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although fraud was not recognized as a defense at law, courts of equity allowed a party who had been a victim of fraud to avoid the contract by way of equitable “rescission.” Rescission amounted to a judicial return of the parties to the status quo that existed before the contract was formed. In rescission a court of equity ordered both the wrongdoer and the injured party to return to the other any money or property received from the other. Over time the law courts recognized a legal right of rescission, which was similar to the equitable remedy but differed in some technical respects. In particular, at law in order to obtain rescission, a party had to show that she had made a “tender” of any money or property received before instituting the action, while in equity tender was unnecessary. With the procedural merger of law and equity in the nineteenth century, the difference between legal and equitable rescission has become relatively unimportant, although there are still situations in which the difference can be significant. (For example, if a party complies with the requirements of legal rescission, including tender, she is entitled to avoid the contract; a court could refuse to grant the remedy of equitable rescission if the court concludes that fairness does not warrant rescission of the transaction.)</p>
<p id="03786746-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a result of these historical developments, under modern law a victim of misrepresentation may have a choice between two significant avenues of redress: a tort action for damages or a right to avoid the enforceability of the contract by way of rescission. (This right of rescission could be exercised either by defense to an action to enforce the contract or in an affirmative action seeking restitution of benefits conferred on the other party.) What factors affect <span title="611" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-611">p. 611</span>the choice between these two remedies, making one or the other more attractive or, possibly, unavailable as a remedy? One such factor is that the remedy of rescission requires the injured party to return any money or property that he has received; thus, if the defrauded party does not want to do so, rescission is not a desirable remedy. Suppose, for example, that the purchaser of a home receives a “termite letter” from the seller stating that the home is free of wood-boring insects. After purchasing the home, the buyer learns that the home is infested with termites. It turns out that the seller fraudulently procured the termite letter by bribing the termite company. If the buyer does not want to give up the home, a tort action for money damages to compensate the buyer for the termite problem is a more attractive remedy than rescission. For a discussion of the election between an action in tort for damages and rescission of the contract seeking restitution, see InterCall, Inc. v. Egenera, Inc., 824 N.W.2d 12 (Neb. 2012).</p>
<p id="03786747-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sometimes rescission may be unavailable even if the defrauded party would prefer this remedy. If the defrauded party is unable to return the property received from the wrongdoer because it has been transferred to a third person, rescission may not be allowed. Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment §66. On the other hand, sometimes a party may be able to obtain rescission even though a tort remedy would be unavailable. A party may rescind a contract for a material misrepresentation even if the misrepresentation was not made with fraudulent intent. Restatement (Second) §164(1) (contract voidable for either fraudulent or material misrepresentation). The law may not recognize a tort action or may limit the scope of the remedy, however, if the misrepresentation was not made with fraudulent intent (often called “scienter”). Compare Restatement (Second) of Torts §549 (damages for fraudulent misrepresentation) with §§552, 552B, and 552C (remedy and damages for negligent and innocent misrepresentation).</p>

<p id="0379791e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Included in the courses offered were lifetime memberships. With the purchase of 1,000 or 1,200 hours of instruction it was the policy of defendants to give free attendance to weekly dances for life and two hours of instruction or practice a month to keep active on what had been learned. Included in plaintiff’s purchases were three lifetime memberships. Plaintiff attended the weekly dances and incidental entertainments and admitted having fun.</p>
<p id="0379791f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff testified that defendants’ manager sold her the first lifetime membership. She testified “He promised me all the privileges of the studio and I would be a professional dancer.” To make such a promise to a lady plaintiff’s age was ridiculous. The fact that she was so gullible as to be an easy victim does not justify taking over $29,000 of her money. She may have been willing and easily sold but nevertheless a victim.</p>
<p id="03797920-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The members of defendants’ staff were carefully schooled and supervised in the art of high-powered salesmanship. Mr. Carey, a witness for plaintiff, testified at length as to methods and as to his contact with plaintiff. There was evidence that Mr. Carey was a disgruntled former employee and instructor and had expressed hostility toward defendants, but his credibility was for the jury.</p>
<p id="03797921-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="614" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-614">p. 614</span>Defendants’ studio occupies seven rooms consisting of a grand ballroom and six private studios. Each private studio is wired for sound so the manager could monitor conversations between instructor and student and without the student’s knowledge correct the instructor’s sales technique.</p>
<p id="03797922-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Carey had received two months training including a course on sales technique taught by the manager. Plaintiff’s Exhibit H is a revised edition of defendants’ “Eight Good Rules For Interviewing.” It is an exhaustive set of instructions, outlines and suggested conversations covering twenty-two typewritten pages. A few pertinent parts are:</p>

That they will be an excellent ballroom dancer in much less time and that if they didn’t have natural ability it would take twice as long.</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="03797928-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In quoting the price for various courses, the instructor is supposed to say “the trouble with most people is that they dance lifelessly, but as I told you on your analysis, you have animation—vitality in your dancing. No matter what course you decide on you’re going to be a really smooth dancer (men would rather be a smooth dancer—women would rather be a beautiful, graceful dancer).”</p></li>

</ol>
</div>
<p id="0379792a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Theoretically, for advancing proficiency in dancing (the jury must have thought that $29,000 had something to do with it), plaintiff was awarded a Bronze Medal, then a Silver Medal and then a Gold Medal. These awards were given plaintiff all in the same year although defendants’ manager testified that it takes approximately two to four years to qualify for a Bronze Medal, five to seven years for a Silver Medal and anytime after 1200 hours a student could qualify for the Gold Medal. Finally after considerable thought about new incentives for plaintiff to buy something more she was shown a film on Gold Star dancing. This is a difficult professional type of dancing. “The dancers on the film were brought in from Europe by Mr. Murray. The dancing is English quick step and is the type of dancing done by Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire only about twice as difficult.” This film had been studied 15 to 20 times to determine what parts to stress with plaintiff.</p>
<p id="0379792b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff was easily sold a Gold Star course of 625 hours for $6,250. A few days later she came into the ballroom, handed Mr. Carey an envelope and said <span title="615" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-615">p. 615</span>“Well, it took some doing but here is the money.” The money was delivered to the manager.</p>
<p id="0379792c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Gold Star course was started although even the instructor was “faking it” and had no idea what he was doing.</p>
<p id="0379792d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Carey testified that from 1957 through the fall of 1960 plaintiff’s dancing ability did not improve. “She was 68 years old and had gone as far as she would ever go in dancing, thereon it would be merely repetitious.” In his opinion “it would take 200 to 400 hours of instructions to teach her to dance in the manner she was dancing in 1960.” He also testified that while he was at the studio none of his students ever failed to qualify for any of the medals. When he questioned plaintiff’s ability to do the advanced type of dancing she was being sold he was reminded by defendants’ manager that he was an employee and that the manager made the rules.</p>
<p id="0379792e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Carey testified at length as to the attentions, inducements, promises and lies (he said they were) lavished on plaintiff. He became plaintiff’s regular instructor. He was about twenty-five years old and apparently quite charming and fascinating to plaintiff. She gave him a diamond ring for his birthday in 1960.</p>
<p id="0379792f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The testimony is rather fantastic but it would unduly extend this opinion to set it forth in greater detail. It was in our opinion sufficient for the jury to find that plaintiff was the victim of a calculated course of intentional misrepresentations.</p>
<p id="03797930-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The charge for instruction varied somewhat up to $10 per hour. After some refunds, and, according to defendants’ computation, plaintiff paid approximately $6.75 per hour for 3425 hours of instruction or about $23,000.</p>
<p id="03797931-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If Mr. Carey’s estimate of plaintiff’s ability and possibility of progress is accepted plaintiff was knowingly overcharged for 3025 hours or a total sum of $20,418.75.</p>
<p id="03797932-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Carey was discharged by defendants in the fall of 1960. Plaintiff quit the studio shortly thereafter. She still had 1750 hours of unused time that she had purchased. She testified that she did so because she “was unhappy because things didn’t go right and I was through with dancing, and that was the only reason I quit.” Defendants’ manager testified that plaintiff “became unhappy over the dismissal of Mr. Carey and left the studio.” Another witness for defendants said plaintiff complained mostly about losing her instructor, Mr. Carey.</p>
<p id="03797933-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In January 1961 plaintiff employed counsel to represent her in a lawsuit against defendants. Her counsel contacted defendants. Conferences were held. Apparently a divertive campaign was planned by defendants. Mr. Carey testified:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="0379a044-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I next heard from Mr. Theiss in January of 1961 when he called and asked me to come down to the studio to discuss employment. I went to see him and he told me that Mrs. Syester was suing him and wanted to know if I still had any influence over her, to get her to drop the suit. I told him I felt that I still did and I would try to get her to come back in the studio and drop her legal action against him. He said he would reinstate me and pay all of my past due <span title="616" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-616">p. 616</span>commissions. I accepted the position and went to Bishop’s Cafeteria where Mrs. Syester was the coffee girl to see what her feelings were toward the studio. She was very cold toward me and I reported this to Mr. Theiss. He said not to concern myself with the studio, that my job was merely to get her to drop the lawsuit, so I went to Bishop’s a couple of times a day to try and talk with Mrs. Syester. Finally I succeeded and told her that I was back in the studio and that Mr. Theiss wanted her back. I told her that there would be no hard feelings on our part if she would just drop the suit and come back but she said she did not want to come back to the studio. I continued talking to her and finally got her to accept coming to a party and told her that I would be out to pick her up and escort her to the studio. This was about a week after I first contacted her, in February of 1961. I told her that I was going to the party and I would save her some waltzes. I knew this was her favorite dance. And I felt that if she would pass up this waltz, she was not interested in dancing. She did not come to the studio so the next day I went down to Bishop’s and told her she disappointed me very much. Then I started talking about all of the lessons she and I had had and all of the months we had danced and the fun we had together. I told her how wonderful she had done. I painted word pictures and things so she could see this. I asked her if she remembered about when she got the Bronze. She kept saying that was best but all she wanted was her money back. I finally persuaded her to come to the studio and we danced for about 45 minutes. It was at this time that she called the lawsuit off. . . . When I went to Bishop’s Cafeteria to see Mrs. Syester I told her she was a good dancer and that she still had the ability to be a professional, excellent dancer. I told her that she did not need an attorney; after all Mrs. Theiss and myself were her only friends and we wanted her back at the studio to continue with her Gold Star and reminded her of all the waltzes we would do together.</p>
</div>
<p id="0379a045-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During the month of February several people contacted plaintiff at the instigation of defendants’ manager, including Mr. Carey. These efforts were fruitful. Plaintiff made what defendants claim was a complete settlement. Defendants’ counsel prepared a written release (defendants’ Exhibit 2) and was present during one conference of the parties. Defendants’ counsel did not instigate, carry on, nor make the “settlement” with plaintiff. He testified that he “did not want to get that implicated.” In any event defendants’ manager at plaintiff’s home persuaded plaintiff to discharge her counsel by phone and agree to settle for the refund of her March 2, 1960 payment of $6,090. This was reported to defendants’ counsel, who in behalf of his client, wrote settlement checks. Plaintiff’s counsel received his share although there is no evidence that the settlement was ever pursuant to his advice. There is evidence that defendants were attempting to lead plaintiff away from her own counsel. Their efforts were so far beyond the limits of propriety that their own counsel hesitated to participate.</p>
<p id="0379a046-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The release signed by plaintiff is a specific release of her claim based on the March 2, 1960 payment and a general release of all claims. If obtained in good faith it is a bar to all plaintiff’s claims. The release was witnessed by Estella M. Smith, whose identity does not appear and by defendants’ manager. After signing this release on March 6, 1961 plaintiff’s then pending lawsuit was <span title="617" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-617">p. 617</span>dismissed. Plaintiff returned to the studio and participated in the activities for several months.</p>
<p id="0379a047-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A second release dated January 28, 1963 was obtained by defendants’ manager. It purports to be a contractual release for $4,000. The $4,000 to be paid was to be evidenced by a note. There is no claim that anything has been paid thereon. The note provided for installment payments but instead of being signed by defendants it is signed by plaintiff. Defendants’ manager testified that this was all a mistake and that the studio was to pay.</p>
<p id="0379a048-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accepting defendants’ explanation that it was a mistake the most charitable thing that can be said is that plaintiff would sign anything requested, even a note wherein she was the payee.</p>
<p id="0379a049-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The present action was filed March 12, 1963. It alleged fraud and misrepresentation in the several sales to plaintiff and in obtaining dismissal of the previous lawsuit and the releases signed by plaintiff.</p>
<p id="0379a04a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants denied any fraud or misrepresentations and urged the releases as a complete defense. Defendants offered evidence in support of their position. At the close of plaintiff’s evidence and again at the close of all the evidence defendants moved for a directed verdict. The motions were overruled. The jury returned a verdict for plaintiff in the sum of $14,300 actual damages and $40,000 punitive damages. Defendants appealed.</p>
<p id="0379a04b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I. The court told the jury to first consider the issues involved in the releases signed by plaintiff and placed on plaintiff the burden of proving by clear, satisfactory and convincing evidence that they were not binding on her. This was proper.</p>
<p id="0379a04c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In five instructions, separately numbered but in sequence, the court instructed on fraud, expression of opinion as distinguished from a statement of fact, fraudulent misrepresentation, intent to mislead, consideration for releases, presumption of freedom from fraud, need for prudence in signing and failure of consideration.</p>
<p id="0379a04d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On appeal defendants challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to generate a jury question but not the accuracy of the instructions.</p>
<p id="0379a04e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants argue in the absence of fraud the execution of a valid release bars a future action based on the rights relinquished. The rule is stated in Kilby v. Charles City Western Railway Company, 191 Iowa 926, 928, 183 N.W. 371 as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="0379a04f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where a settlement has been had between competent parties, and a release has been fairly entered into, without fraud or overreaching, it becomes binding and effectual, and will be upheld and enforced. It is undoubtedly the law that an instrument of this character can be impeached for fraud in procuring the same or where the same was executed by a party who was mentally incompetent to legally execute such an instrument. The burden of proof is on the party seeking to impeach such written instrument.</p>
</div>
<p id="0379a050-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mere failure to read an instrument before signing will not avoid its provisions. Crum v. McCollum, 211 Iowa 319, 233 N.W. 678. These propositions are not in dispute and further citation of authority is unnecessary. . . . </p>
<p id="0379a051-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="618" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-618">p. 618</span>. . . The evidence was such that the jury could find that there was such a concerted effort, lacking in propriety, to obtain the releases as to constitute fraudulent overreaching. The jury obviously concluded that there was a predatory play on the vanity and credulity of an old lady. We find no reason for interfering with that conclusion.</p>
<p id="0379a052-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">II. Defendants argue that “In an action based upon fraud, certain universally recognized elements must be alleged and shown, and the failure to establish any one or more of such elements is fatal to such action.” With this statement we agree and so did the trial court. In Instruction No. 10 the jury was told that to recover the burden was on plaintiff to establish by clear, satisfactory and convincing evidence each of the following propositions:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-decimal">
<li class=""><p id="0379a053-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That the defendants made one or more of the representations claimed by plaintiff. . . . </p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0379c764-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That said statements, or one or more of them, were false.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0379c765-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That said false statements or representations were as to material matters with reference to the entering into the lesson contracts.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0379c766-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That the defendants knew the said representations, or one or more of them, were false.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0379c767-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That said representations were made with intent to deceive and defraud the plaintiff.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0379c768-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That the plaintiff believed and relied upon said false representations and would not have entered into the lesson contracts, except for believing and relying upon said misrepresentations.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0379c769-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That the plaintiff was damaged in some amount through relying on said representations.</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="0379c76a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If you find that the plaintiff has established each and every one of the foregoing propositions, numbered 1 to 7 inclusive by evidence which is clear, satisfactory and convincing, then your verdict will be for the plaintiff and against the defendants in such amount as you find plaintiff is justly entitled to receive.</p>
<p id="0379c76b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If you find, however, that the plaintiff has failed to establish any one or more of the foregoing propositions, numbered 1 to 7 inclusive, then your verdict will be for the defendants.</p>
</div>
<p id="0379c76c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The instruction was adequate. Here again the problem was factual. Defendants argue that the representations proved by plaintiff were nothing more than mere expressions of opinion or “puffing” and that the only substantial expression of opinion was in fact accomplished.</p>
<p id="0379c76d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Christy v. Heil, supra, we considered statements of fact as distinguished from opinion or puffing. We said “Ordinarily the question of whether the representations made are opinion or fact is for the jury to determine and depends upon the facts and circumstances in each case.” (Citations) loc. cit. 608, 123 N.W.2d loc. cit. 411. “We must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the purchasers.” loc. cit. 613, 123 N.W.2d loc. cit. 414.</p>
<p id="0379c76e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants’ review of the authorities is exhaustive and scholarly but the fact remains that in the case at bar there was evidence, which if believed by the jury, would support a finding of fraud.</p>
<p id="0379c76f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="619" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-619">p. 619</span>III. Defendants argue that there was no proof of damage. Although the court’s instructions on measure of damage were closer to the “out of pocket” rule than to the “benefit of bargain” rule to which we are committed (see 37 C.J.S. Fraud §143, page 477) defendants make no complaint. The instruction was not prejudicial to defendants. Defendants say that the rule was properly stated but suggest that the statement of the issues including the amount prayed for may have been misleading. The fact that plaintiff asked for something beyond the correct measure of damage is not reversible error if, as defendants say, the court properly instructed the jury.</p>
<p id="0379c770-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants argue that there was no evidence from which the jury could find the fair and reasonable value of the instruction received other than the amount paid by plaintiff. Defendants’ manager testified that plaintiff still has 899 hours of unused lessons. Mr. Carey’s testimony would support a finding that plaintiff was knowingly overcharged for 3025 hours or the sum of $20,418.75. The jury’s verdict for $14,300 actual damages was within the evidence. We have no means of knowing just how the jury computed the damage. It was for more than the charge for the unused time according to defendants, but less than would be due for unproductive instruction. In argument defendants have stressed the value of plaintiff’s enjoyment. That may have entered into the jury’s computation.</p>
<p id="0379c771-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The verdict was not beyond the scope of the evidence or the instructions.</p>

<p id="0379c773-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants argue that the record will not support an award of punitive damages in any amount and that the issue should not have been submitted, but do not challenge the accuracy of the instructions relative thereto.</p>

<li class=""><p id="0379ee8b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Fraudulent or material misrepresentation.</i> Section 164(1) of the Second Restatement provides that a contract is voidable if a party’s “manifestation <span title="620" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-620">p. 620</span>of assent is induced by either a fraudulent or a material misrepresentation by the other party upon which the recipient is justified in relying. . . .” See, e.g., Sarvis v. Vermont State Colleges, 772 A.2d 494 (Vt. 2001) (college could rescind employment agreement when employee gave false information on resume to hide record of criminal incarceration). Restatement (Second) §162(1)(b) and (c) define “fraudulent” also to include an assertion made as true but without knowledge or confidence by the maker whether it is true or false, and thus may include statements that are made recklessly or negligently. See, e.g., Jordan v. Knafel, 880 N.E.2d 1061 (Ill. App. Ct. 2007) (professional basketball player granted declaratory judgment avoiding settlement agreement allegedly induced by fraudulent claim that defendant knew plaintiff to be biological father of her child); Waste Management of Massachusetts, Inc. v. Carver, 642 N.E.2d 1058 (Mass. App. Ct. 1994) (rescission granted where seller made misrepresentation about extent of land contamination without obtaining current information from consultants hired to test land; seller could not avoid liability by ignoring available information).</p>
<p id="0379ee8c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Additionally, as noted by the introduction to this chapter, a contract may be subject to rescission because of an innocent but material misrepresentation, see Restatement (Second) §162(2) and Comment <i>c.</i> See also Alfa Life Ins. Corp. v. Lewis, 910 So. 2d 757 (Ala. 2005) (decedent’s presumably innocent failure to disclose heart condition would still amount to material misrepresentation and allow rescission under insurance code); Groothand v. Schlueter, 949 S.W.2d 923 (Mo. Ct. App. 1997) (rescission available for buyers of house with structural problems without showing that sellers knew representations to be false). Was there evidence on which the jury could find that the releases in <i>Syester</i> were induced by misrepresentation? Can you think of other bases for avoiding a contract that might be applicable to this case?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0379ee8d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Contract or tort claim.</i> Assuming the jury could properly find that the releases were voidable because induced by misrepresentation, Ms. Syester could then assert a tort claim for damages based on the defendants’ fraud in inducing her to enter into the series of contracts for dancing instruction. Could Ms. Syester have also attempted to rescind these contracts rather than attempting to recover damages in tort for fraud? As a tactical matter, should she have done so?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0379ee8e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Misrepresentation based on false opinion or prediction.</i> One of the instructions given by the lower court to the jury dealt with the distinction between statements of opinion and representations of fact. The Restatement (Second) defines an opinion as the expression of a belief, without certainty, as to the existence of a fact. Typically, opinions deal with matters such as quality or value of property. Restatement (Second) §168(1). The classical rule was that a statement of opinion could not be fraudulent, an approach based on the view that the morals of the marketplace required a certain degree of leeway for “puffing” in bargaining. Under the Restatement (Second), however, a statement of opinion amounts to a misrepresentation of fact if the person giving the opinion misrepresented his state of mind (i.e., stated that he held a certain opinion when in fact he did not). Restatement (Second) §159, Comment <i>d.</i> See also <span title="621" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-621">p. 621</span>Bennett v. Coors Brewing Co., 189 F.3d 1221 (10th Cir. 1999) (employees made prima facie case of misrepresentation by showing that employer made false statements about plans to downsize in order to get employees to take severance package). Moreover, under §169 of the Restatement (Second), a statement of opinion may also be actionable if the one giving the opinion (a) stands in a relationship of trust or confidence to the recipient (a “fiduciary relationship”), (b) is an expert on matters covered by the opinion, or (c) renders the opinion to one who, because of age or other factors, is peculiarly susceptible to misrepresentation. Which of these rules could apply to the facts of the <i>Syester</i> case?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0379ee8f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Reasonable reliance.</i> Assuming that a misrepresentation occurred in <i>Syester</i>, is it clear that all the other elements for misrepresentation are present? Was reliance by the plaintiff reasonable? See Schlaifer Nance &amp; Co. v. Estate of Andy Warhol, 119 F.3d 91 (2d Cir. 1997) (purchaser of license to reproduce Andy Warhol’s artwork did not reasonably rely on false statements that estate held all property rights in light of overt evidence to contrary); Mehta v. Mehta, 602 N.Y.S.2d 142 (App. Div. 1993) (reliance by one party on other’s misrepresentation of the value of jointly owned assets was not reasonable where both parties had equal access to business records). Notably, the fact that the misrepresentation relates to a matter of public record will not necessarily preclude reasonable reliance. See, e.g., Cao v. Nguyen, 607 N.W.2d 528 (Neb. 2000) (false statement that house was a duplex constituted grounds for rescission even though public records revealed that house was legal only for single occupancy; buyers’ reliance was reasonable under circumstances).</p>
<p id="0379ee90-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If Mrs. Syester was not reasonable in relying on representations that she had the ability to become a professional dancer, then what could justify the jury verdict and appellate decision in her favor? The case may have involved enough instances of clear fraud, such as the selling of the “Gold Star” lessons that the instructor had no qualifications to teach, to warrant the decision in Mrs. Syester’s favor. Or perhaps the outcome suggests that the common law is in fact imbued with principles of morality and the need to protect those perceived as vulnerable. See also Bennett v. Bailey, 597 S.W.2d 532 (Tex. Civ. App. 1980) (upholding award of $78,000 in treble damages to widow under state consumer protection law after dance studio engaged in deceptive practices in selling her almost $30,000 in dance lessons). For further discussion of <i>Syester</i> and other similar cases, see Charles L. Knapp, Cases and Controversies: Some Things to Do with Contracts Cases, 88 Wash. L. Rev. 1357, 1366-1368 (2013) (suggesting that the best explanation for the result in <i>Syester</i> is the doctrine of undue influence); Debora L. Threedy, Dancing around Gender: Lessons from Arthur Murray on Gender and Contracts, 45 Wake Forest L. Rev. 749 (2010).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0379ee91-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Ethical limits on attorney’s direct contact with opposing party.</i> In an effort to get Ms. Syester to sign the releases, the defendants persuaded her to discharge her attorney. At the time the defendants were also represented by counsel. Under the Model Rules of Professional Conduct, it is improper for a lawyer to “communicate about the subject of the representation with a person the lawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter, unless the lawyer has <span title="622" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-622">p. 622</span>the consent of the other lawyer or is authorized to do so by law or court order.” Model Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 4.2. What is the purpose of this rule? Did the defendants’ lawyer violate the rule?</p></li>

<p id="037a15a8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Must the seller of a residence disclose to the buyer facts pertaining to past termite infestation? This is the primary question presented in this appeal. Plaintiffs Warren G. Hill and Gloria R. Hill (buyers) filed suit to rescind an agreement to purchase a residence. Buyers alleged that Ora G. Jones and Barbara R. Jones (sellers) had made misrepresentations concerning termite damage in the residence and had failed to disclose to them the existence of the damage and history of termite infestation in the residence. The trial court dismissed the claim for misrepresentation based upon a so-called integration clause in the parties’ agreement.</p>
<p id="037a15a9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sellers then sought summary judgment on the “concealment” claim arguing that they had no duty to disclose information pertaining to termite infestation and that even if they did, the record failed to show all of the elements necessary for fraudulent concealment. The trial court granted summary judgment, finding that there was “no genuinely disputed issue of material fact and that the law favors the . . . defendants.” The trial court awarded sellers $1,000.00 in attorney’s fees. Buyers have appealed from the judgment and sellers have cross-appealed from the trial court’s ruling on attorney’s fees.</p>
<p id="037a15aa-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>I. <span class="epub-small-caps">Facts</span></b></p>
<p id="037a15ab-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1982, buyers entered into an agreement to purchase sellers’ residence for $72,000. The agreement was entered after buyers made several visits to the home. The purchase agreement provided that sellers were to pay for and place in escrow a termite inspection report stating that the property was free from evidence of termite infestation. Escrow was scheduled to close two months later.</p>
<p id="037a15ac-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of the central features of the house is a parquet teak floor covering the sunken living room, the dining room, the entryway and portions of the halls. On a subsequent visit to the house, and when sellers were present, buyers noticed a small “ripple” in the wood floor on the step leading up to the dining room from the sunken living room. Mr. Hill asked if the ripple could be termite damage. Mrs. Jones answered that it was water damage. A few years previously, a broken water heater in the house had in fact caused water damage in the area of the dining room and steps which necessitated that some repairs be made to the floor. No further discussion on the subject, however, took place between the parties at that time or afterwards.</p>
<p id="037a15ad-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Hill, through his job as maintenance supervisor at a school district, had seen similar “ripples” in wood which had turned out to be termite damage. Mr. <span title="623" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-623">p. 623</span>Hill was not totally satisfied with Mrs. Jones’s explanation, but he felt that the termite inspection report would reveal whether the ripple was due to termites or some other cause.</p>
<p id="037a15ae-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The termite inspection report stated that there was no visible evidence of infestation. The report failed to note the existence of physical damage or evidence of previous treatment. The realtor notified the parties that the property had passed the termite inspection. Apparently, neither party actually saw the report prior to close of escrow.</p>
<p id="037a15af-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After moving into the house, buyers found a pamphlet left in one of the drawers entitled “Termites, the Silent Saboteurs.” They learned from a neighbor that the house had some termite infestation in the past. Shortly after the close of escrow, Mrs. Hill noticed that the wood on the steps leading down to the sunken living room was crumbling. She called an exterminator who confirmed the existence of termite damage to the floor and steps and to wood columns in the house. The estimated cost of repairing the wood floor alone was approximately $5,000.</p>
<p id="037a15b0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Through discovery after their lawsuit was filed, buyers learned the following. When sellers purchased the residence in 1974, they received two termite guarantees that had been given to the previous owner by Truly Nolen, as well as a diagram showing termite treatment at the residence that had taken place in 1963. The guarantees provided for semi-annual inspections and annual termite booster treatments. The accompanying diagram stated that the existing damage had not been repaired. The second guarantee, dated 1965, reinstated the earlier contract for inspection and treatment. Mr. Jones admitted that he read the guarantees when he received them. Sellers renewed the guarantees when they purchased the residence in 1974. They also paid the annual fee each year until they sold the home.</p>
<p id="037a15b1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On two occasions during sellers’ ownership of the house but while they were at their other residence in Minnesota, a neighbor noticed “streamers” evidencing live termites in the wood tile floor near the entryway. On both occasions, Truly Nolen gave a booster treatment for termites. On the second incident, Truly Nolen drilled through one of the wood tiles to treat for termites. The neighbor showed Mr. Jones the area where the damage and treatment had occurred. Sellers had also seen termites on the back fence and had replaced and treated portions of the fence.</p>
<p id="037a3cc2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sellers did not mention any of this information to buyers prior to close of escrow. They did not mention the past termite infestation and treatment to the realtor or to the termite inspector. There was evidence of holes on the patio that had been drilled years previously to treat for termites. The inspector returned to the residence to determine why he had not found evidence of prior treatment and termite damage. He indicated that he had not seen the holes in the patio because of boxes stacked there. It is unclear whether the boxes had been placed there by buyers or sellers. He had not found the damage inside the house because a large plant, which buyers had purchased from sellers, covered the area. After investigating the second time, the inspector found the damage and evidence of past treatment. He acknowledged that this information should have <span title="624" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-624">p. 624</span>appeared in the report. He complained, however, that he should have been told of any history of termite infestation and treatment before he performed his inspection and that it was customary for the inspector to be given such information.</p>
<p id="037a3cc3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other evidence presented to the trial court was that during their numerous visits to the residence before close of escrow, buyers had unrestricted access to view and inspect the entire house. Both Mr. and Mrs. Hill had seen termite damage and were therefore familiar with what it might look like. Mr. Hill had seen termite damage on the fence at this property. Mrs. Hill had noticed the holes on the patio but claimed not to realize at the time what they were for. Buyers asked no questions about termites except when they asked if the “ripple” on the stairs was termite damage. Mrs. Hill admitted she was not “trying” to find problems with the house because she really wanted it.</p>

<p id="037a3cc5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We first turn to the trial court’s ruling that the agreement of the parties did not give buyers the right to rely on the statement made by Mrs. Jones that the “ripple” in the floor was water damage. We find this ruling to be in error. The contract provision upon which the trial court based its ruling reads as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="037a3cc6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That the Purchaser has investigated the said premises, and the Broker and the Seller are hereby released from all responsibility regarding the valuation thereof, and neither Purchaser, Seller, nor Broker shall be bound by any understanding, agreement, promise, representation or stipulation expressed or implied, not specified herein.</p>

<p id="037a3cc7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Lufty v. R. D. Roper &amp; Sons Motor Co., 57 Ariz. 495, 506, 115 P.2d 161, 166 (1941), the Arizona Supreme Court considered a similar clause in an agreement and concluded that “any provision in a contract making it possible for a party thereto to free himself from the consequences of his own fraud in procuring its execution is invalid and necessarily constitutes no defense.” The court went on to hold that “parol evidence is always admissible to show fraud, and this is true, even though it has the effect of varying the terms of a writing between the parties.” 57 Ariz. at 506-507, 115 P.2d at 166; Barnes v. Lopez, 25 Ariz. App. 477, 480, 544 P.2d 694, 697 (1976). In this case, the claimed misrepresentation occurred after the parties executed the contract.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BE6_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10BE6_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">1</a></span> Assuming, for the purposes of this decision, that the integration clause would extend to statements made subsequent to the execution of the contract, the clause could not shield sellers from liability should buyers be able to prove fraud.</p>

<p id="037a3cca-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The principal legal question presented in this appeal is whether a seller has a duty to disclose to the buyer the existence of termite damage in a residential <span title="625" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-625">p. 625</span>dwelling known to the seller, but not to the buyer, which materially affects the value of the property.

<p id="037a3ccb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is not the place to trace the history of the doctrine of caveat emptor. Suffice it to say that its vitality has waned during the latter half of the 20th century. E.g., Richards v.

Pima Community College Dist. Bd., 113 Ariz. 85, 87, 546 P.2d 821, 823 (1976); Batty v. Arizona State Dental Bd., 57 Ariz. 239, 254, 112 P.2d 870, 877 (1941). As the supreme court noted in the context of a confidential relationship, “[s]uppression of a material fact which a party is bound in good faith to disclose is equivalent to a false representation.” Leigh v. Loyd, 74 Ariz. 84, 87, 244 P.2d 356, 358 (1952); National Housing Indus. Inc. v. E. L. Jones Dev. Co., 118 Ariz. 374, 379, 576 P.2d 1374, 1379 (1978).</p>
<p id="037a63e2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, the important question we must answer is whether under the facts of this case, buyers should have been permitted to present to the jury their claim that sellers were under a duty to disclose their (sellers’) knowledge of termite infestation in the residence. This broader question involves two inquiries. First, must a seller of residential property advise the buyer of material facts within his knowledge pertaining to the value of the property? Second, may termite damage and the existence of past infestation constitute such material facts?</p>
<p id="037a63e3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The doctrine imposing a duty to disclose is akin to the well-established contractual rules pertaining to relief from contracts based upon mistake. Although the law of contracts supports the finality of transactions, over the years courts have recognized that under certain limited circumstances it is unjust to strictly enforce the policy favoring finality. Thus, for example, even a unilateral mistake of one party to a transaction may justify rescission. Restatement §153.</p>
<p id="037a63e4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="626" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-626">p. 626</span>There is also a judicial policy promoting honesty and fair dealing in business relationships. This policy is expressed in the law of fraudulent and negligent misrepresentations. Where a misrepresentation is fraudulent or where a negligent misrepresentation is one of material fact, the policy of finality rightly gives way to the policy of promoting honest dealings between the parties. See Restatement §164(1).</p>
<p id="037a63e5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under certain circumstances nondisclosure of a fact known to one party may be equivalent to the assertion that the fact does not exist. For example “[w]hen one conveys a false impression by the disclosure of some facts and the concealment of others, such concealment is in effect a false representation that what is disclosed is the whole truth.” State v. Coddington, 135 Ariz. 480, 481, 662 P.2d 155, 156 (App. 1983). Thus, nondisclosure may be equated with and given the same legal effect as fraud and misrepresentation. One category of cases where this has been done involves the area of nondisclosure of material facts affecting the value of property, known to the seller but not reasonably capable of being known to the buyer.</p>
<p id="037a63e6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts have formulated this “duty to disclose” in slightly different ways. For example, the Florida Supreme Court recently declared that “where the seller of a home knows of facts materially affecting the value of the property which are not readily observable and are not known to the buyer, the seller is under a duty to disclose them to the buyer.” Johnson v. Davis, 480 So. 2d 625, 629 (Fla. 1985) (defective roof in three-year old home). In California, the rule has been stated this way:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="037a63e7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[W]here the seller knows of facts materially affecting the value or desirability of the property which are known or accessible only to him and also knows that such facts are not known to, or within the reach of the diligent attention and observation of the buyer, the seller is under a duty to disclose them to the buyer.</p>

The existence of termite damage and past termite <span title="627" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-627">p. 627</span>infestation has been considered by other courts to be sufficiently material to warrant disclosure. See generally Annotation, 22 A.L.R.3d 972 (1968).</p>
<p id="037a8afc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Lynn v. Taylor, 7 Kan. App. 2d 369, 642 P.2d 131 (1982), the purchaser of a termite-damaged residence brought suit against the seller and realtor for fraud and against the termite inspector for negligence. An initial termite report found evidence of prior termite infestation and recommended treatment. A second report indicated that the house was termite free. The first report was not given to the buyer. The seller contended that because treatment would not have repaired the existing damage, the first report was not material. The buyer testified that he would not have purchased the house had he known of the first report. Under these circumstances, the court concluded that the facts contained in the first report were material. See Hunt v. Walker, 483 S.W.2d 732 (Tenn. App. 1971) (severe damage to the residence by past termite infestation); Mercer v. Woodard, 166 Ga. App. 119, 123, 303 S.E.2d 475, 481-482 (1983) (duty of disclosure extends to fact of past termite damage).</p>
<p id="037a8afd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although sellers have attempted to draw a distinction between live termites<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C5B_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10C5B_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">4</a></span> and past infestation, the concept of materiality is an elastic one which is not limited by the termites’ health. “A matter is material if it is one to which a reasonable person would attach importance in determining his choice of action in the transaction in question.” Lynn v. Taylor, 7 Kan. App. 2d at 371, 642 P.2d at 134-135. For example, termite damage substantially affecting the structural soundness of the residence may be material even if there is no evidence of present infestation. Unless reasonable minds could not differ, materiality is a factual matter which must be determined by the trier of fact. The termite damage in this case may or may not be material. Accordingly, we conclude that buyers should be allowed to present their case to a jury.</p>
<p id="037a8aff-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sellers argue that even assuming the existence of a duty to disclose, summary judgment was proper because the record shows that their “silence . . . did not induce or influence” the buyers. This is so, sellers contend, because Mr. Hill stated in his deposition that he intended to rely on the termite inspection report. But this argument begs the question. If sellers were fully aware of the extent of termite damage and if such information had been disclosed to buyers, a jury could accept Mr. Hill’s testimony that had he known of the termite damage he would not have purchased the house.</p>
<p id="037a8b00-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sellers further contend that buyers were put on notice of the possible existence of termite infestation and were therefore “chargeable with the knowledge which [an] inquiry, if made, would have revealed.” Godfrey v. Navratil, 3 Ariz. App. 47, 51, 411 P.2d 470 (1966) (quoting Luke v. Smith, 13 Ariz. 155, 162, 108 P. 494, 496 (1910)).

<li class=""><p id="037ab216-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Historical perspective: Laidlaw v. Organ.</i>  The classical view was that a party to a business transaction could not avoid the transaction because of nondisclosure of material information by the other party. Reflecting the ethic of individualism, courts required a party to protect his own interests by requesting information from the other party or by making an adequate investigation before entering into a transaction. Perhaps the leading example of the nineteenth century approach is Laidlaw v. Organ, 15 U.S. (2 Wheat) 178 (1817). In <i>Laidlaw</i>, the plaintiff buyer alleged a wrongful refusal by the defendant seller to deliver a quantity of tobacco pursuant to a contract of purchase. The defendant claimed it was privileged to avoid the contract on the ground of fraud by the buyer. The contract was made in New Orleans, at a time when news of the Treaty of Ghent, ending the war with Britain, had not yet reached that city. The buyer’s agent was aware of the ending of the war; the seller’s agent was not. And when the seller’s agent asked if there was any news “calculated to enhance the price or value” of the tobacco, the buyer’s agent remained silent, despite the fact that the ending of the war could increase the market value of the tobacco by as much as 50 percent. The judge at trial refused to allow a defense of fraud into the case and directed a verdict for the buyer. On appeal, the Supreme Court reversed and sent the case back for retrial on the issue of whether the buyer had committed actual fraud. The Court, however, agreed with the buyer’s argument that liability could not be based on the buyer’s failure to disclose any special knowledge it may have had about the end of the war.</p>

<li class=""><p id="037ab219-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Modern approach to nondisclosure.</i> The modern view is that in some situations a failure to disclose a known material fact may justify rescission of a contract. Restatement (Second) §161. While Restatement §161(a), (c), and (d) provide for rescission because of nondisclosure only in limited situations, §161(b) states a broader basis for relief: when the nondisclosure amounts to a failure to act in accordance with standards of good faith and fair dealing. When should this provision be applied? Professor Page Keeton suggested several factors that a court should consider in deciding when fairness requires disclosure of material information, including the differences in intelligences of the parties, their relationship, the manner in which the information was acquired (whether by chance or effort), whether the fact that was not disclosed was readily discoverable, whether the person failing to make disclosure was the seller rather than the buyer, the type of contract (insurance or releases, for example, typically require full disclosure), the importance of the fact not disclosed, and whether active concealment occurred. W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts §106, at 739 (5th ed. 1984), summarizing factors set forth in W. Page Keeton, Fraud—Concealment and Non-disclosure, 15 Tex. L. Rev. 1 (1936). See, e.g., Capson Physicians Insurance Company v. MMIC Insurance Inc., 829 F.3d 951 (8th Cir. 2016) (rescission granted to professional liability insurer based on nondisclosure by insured physician and hospital of lawsuit pending against physician when prior acts coverage was added).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="037ab21a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Different types of “fraud.”</i> While students will encounter claims of “fraud” in many cases in this course and others, the term is often used loosely. Analytically it is important to recognize that misrepresentation or nondisclosure of information can be actionable in various ways, sometimes in tort and sometimes in contract. Each theory will have distinct elements, and theories may have different procedural and substantive consequences (for example, differing statutes of limitation and separate remedies). Moreover, courts may use different labels for the theories. The facts in the <i>Hill</i> case could give rise to at least three different claims of fraud: “actual fraud” or fraudulent inducement (as in the <i>Syester</i> case and addressed by the Restatement (2d) §164); fraudulent nondisclosure (sometimes labeled as “fraud by silence” and addressed by the Restatement (2d) §161); and “fraudulent concealment” based on the seller allegedly placing boxes or a potted plant over water or termite damage — in other words, a “cover up” in both a literal and figurative sense. See Restatement (Second) §160. In addition, a misrepresentation of material facts may be the basis of an action to rescind a contract even if made innocently, under Restatement (Second) §164(1).</p>
<p id="037ab21b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Hill</i> involved a claim for rescission of the contract rather than damages in tort. Could the plaintiffs have recovered in a tort action for damages? The <span title="630" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-630">p. 630</span>Restatement (Second) of Torts §551 provides that nondisclosure will give rise to liability if the party is “under a duty to the other to exercise reasonable care to disclose the matter in question” and then indicates that the duty arises in a number of situations including when there is a fiduciary or similar relationship, when partial or earlier disclosures would be misleading, and when the other party would reasonably expect disclosure of facts that are basic to the transaction. See, e.g., Bearden v. Honeywell Int’l Inc., 720 F. Supp. 2d 932 (M.D. Tenn. 2010) (under Tennessee law, seller of goods to consumers has duty to disclose dangerous conditions and material facts unknown to buyer and not reasonably discoverable, citing §551); Pearson v. Simmonds Precision Products, Inc., 624 A.2d 1134 (Vt. 1993) (employer liable in tort for negligent failure to disclose that there was a “good chance” that newly recruited employee’s position might be terminated).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="037ab21c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Real estate disclosure statutes and common law actions</i>. Since the time that the <i>Hill</i> court rendered its decision, a clear majority of states has adopted statutory law that supplements or perhaps displaces common law requirements for disclosure by sellers in residential real estate transactions. See Stephanie Stern, Temporal Dynamics of Disclosure: The Example of Residential Real Estate Conveyancing, 2005 Utah L. Rev. 57, 60-64. These statutes impose on sellers a duty of disclosure of extensive information regarding the condition of the property being sold. If the particular statute creates a cause of action, the buyer may bring suit under the statutory provision. See, e.g., Hammes v. JCLB Props., L.L.C., 764 N.W.2d 552 (Iowa Ct. App. 2008) (common law claim for fraudulent nondisclosure and statutory claim are distinct causes of action with different elements; statute requires plaintiff to show seller’s actual knowledge of condition required to be disclosed). The state disclosure law may also specifically exempt some information from the disclosure requirements even if many buyers might deem the matter to be materially important to the purchase. See, e.g., Lerner v. DMB Realty, LLC, 322 P.3d 909 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2014) (statute precluded seller liability for failure to disclose presence of registered sex offender in neighborhood).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="037ab21d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Effect of fiduciary relationship.</i> One of the factors mentioned by Professor Keeton in determining whether a party has a duty of disclosure of material information to the other party is the relationship between the parties (factor 2). The Restatement refers to a “relationship of trust and confidence.” Restatement (Second) §161(d). Such an association is often called a “fiduciary” relationship and a greater duty is imposed between two contracting parties. See E. Allan Farnsworth, Contracts §4.27, at 297-298 (4th ed. 2004). When a fiduciary relationship exists, not only does this duty of disclosure apply, but the law also imposes additional obligations on the fiduciary: The terms of the transaction must be fair and must be fully explained to the other party. Restatement (Second) §173. Moreover, the fiduciary has the burden of proving compliance with her legal obligations by clear and convincing evidence. See Miller v. Sears, 636 P.2d 1183 (Alaska 1981) (contract for sale of property subject to rescission by client because attorney failed to establish that he had fully disclosed all material terms to client; attorney has burden of proving compliance with <span title="631" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-631">p. 631</span>fiduciary duties by clear and convincing evidence). What is the justification for these stringent requirements?</p>
<p id="037ab21e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Historically, certain relationships — lawyer and client, trustee and beneficiary — have been treated as fiduciary in character. The comment that follows these notes discusses some of the important ethical obligations that lawyers as fiduciaries owe to their clients. In addition, a fiduciary relationship can exist when one party reposes trust and confidence in another party who, in turn, accepts and fosters the relationship. Mere friendship standing alone, however, is not sufficient to establish a fiduciary relationship. See Arko v. Cirou, 700 S.E.2d 604 (Ga. Ct. App. 2010) (lender’s close personal relationship with borrowers not enough to establish confidential relationship).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="037ad92f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Effect of disclaimer or merger clause.</i> The court in <i>Hill</i> ruled that the contract integration clause did not bar the purchasers’ action to rescind the contract on the basis of fraud because “any provision in a contract making it possible for a party thereto to free himself from the consequences of his own fraud in procuring its execution is invalid and necessarily constitutes no defense.” The maxim that “fraud vitiates every transaction” has long been part of the common law, e.g., Sabo v. Delman, 143 N.E.2d 906 (N.Y. 1957) (clause in patent assignment agreement disclaiming all verbal representations was ineffective to bar claim to rescind contract due to fraud). However, in the landmark case of Danann Realty Corp. v. Harris, 157 N.E.2d 597 (N.Y. 1959), decided just two years after <i>Sabo</i>, the New York Court of Appeals held that when a contract contains a “specific” disclaimer of representations (as opposed to a “general and vague merger clause”), a tort action for fraud will not lie because the clause shows a lack of justified reliance on any oral representations. But see Wilson v. McCann, 2014 WL 5326173 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div.) (provision that property sold “as is” or in “present condition” is ineffective with regard to concealment or nondisclosure of material defects that were known or should have been known to seller and were not readily apparent to buyer).</p>
<p id="037ad930-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some courts have held that an “as is” clause precludes a claim for nondisclosure but does not bar a cause of action for fraudulent misrepresentation or fraudulent concealment. See Goddard v. Stabile, 924 N.E.2d 868 (Ohio Ct. App. 2009). Moreover, if the misrepresentation was innocent, a disclaimer may be effective. Compare Wilkinson v. Carpenter, 554 P.2d 512 (Or. 1976) (disclaimer would be effective when alleged misrepresentation was innocent and not intentional), with Bank of Montreal v. Signet Bank, 193 F.3d 818 (4th Cir. 1999) (disclaiming language in contract would not bar claim of innocent misrepresentation because misrepresentation of material fact is always ground for rescission or action for damages).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="037ad931-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Economic analysis of nondisclosure.</i> An article by Professor Anthony Kronman presents an economic analysis of the duty of disclosure. Professor Kronman argues that courts should draw a distinction between information that has been casually acquired and information obtained through a deliberate and costly investigation. Disclosure of deliberately acquired information should <span title="632" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-632">p. 632</span>not be required, he contends, because it is socially desirable to give parties an incentive to acquire information. Nondisclosure protects a party’s investment in the acquisition of such information. (Kronman points out that a rule permitting nondisclosure amounts to a legal recognition of a property right in the information.) Casually acquired information, on the other hand, does not reflect an investment of resources. Kronman argues that disclosure of such information should be required when the holder knows that the other party is without such information, because disclosure is the least costly method of reducing mistaken contracts. Anthony T. Kronman, Mistake, Disclosure, Information and the Law of Contracts, 7 J. Legal Stud. 1, 16-18 (1978). Compare Robert L. Birmingham, The Duty to Disclose and the Prisoner’s Dilemma: <i>Laidlaw v. Organ,</i> 29 Wm. &amp; Mary L. Rev. 249 (1988) (criticism of Kronman’s economic analysis of the duty of disclosure). Would Professor Kronman’s analysis justify imposing a duty of disclosure in the <i>Hill</i> case?</p></li>

While the rules and procedures vary in different jurisdictions, typically the highest state court (or some board created by the court and acting pursuant to its authority) has promulgated a set of rules of professional conduct. These rules are usually based on Model Rules of Professional Conduct, originally adopted by the American Bar Association in 1983 and revised periodically since then.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10D13_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10D13_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">1</a></span> The American Bar Association, a private association of lawyers, has no legal authority over the practice of law but is extremely influential in the area of professional ethics by virtue of its studies and publications. Rules of professional ethics impose restrictions on the conduct of lawyers principally in three areas: (1) the lawyer-client relationship, (2) the lawyer’s obligations to the system of justice, and (3) permissible methods of obtaining legal business.</p>
<p id="037ad935-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A number of the most important rules of professional ethics focus on the lawyer-client relationship. Generally, these rules reflect three cardinal principles: loyalty, competence, and confidentiality. The duty of loyalty, of course, extends to the avoidance of any conflict of interest arising from the attorney’s representation of clients with interests adverse to each other. Thus, a lawyer must refuse to represent multiple clients if a conflict of interest exists between those clients (a husband and wife in a contested divorce case, for example). Model Rule (MR) 1.7. The duty of loyalty also extends to avoidance of a conflict between the clients’ interests and those of the attorney. For this reason, a lawyer must protect and account for any client money or property that comes into the lawyer’s possession. Further, the lawyer must maintain any client money in a separate “trust account” and not “commingle” client funds with funds belonging to the lawyer. MR 1.15. A lawyer must not violate his obligations as <span title="633" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-633">p. 633</span>a fiduciary to his client by entering into a business transaction with the client unless the transaction meets a number of requirements, including fairness and full disclosure. MR 1.8(a).</p>
<p id="037ad936-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In his representation of a client, a lawyer must handle the matter competently. MR 1.1. A failure to act competently may result in tort liability for malpractice as well as professional discipline. See, e.g., Sierra Fria Corp. v. Evans, 127 F.3d 175 (1st Cir. 1997) (attorney must exercise reasonable care and skill in matter for which attorney was retained); Horne v. Peckham, 158 Cal. Rptr. 714 (Ct. App. 1979) (lawyer who is not a specialist in tax law has a duty either to refer tax matters to a specialist or to conform to the standard expected of a specialist). Finally, subject to certain exceptions, a lawyer must not reveal any confidential information received from a client. MR 1.6. Amendments adopted by the ABA to the Model Rules in the last few years require lawyers to keep abreast of developments in technology as they affect the practice of law and impose an obligation on lawyers to take reasonable precautions to protect the confidentiality of client information particularly in internet-related transactions.</p>
<p id="037ad937-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While the lawyer’s relationship with his client is central to his role, lawyers are also officers of the court and as such have obligations to the system of justice. A lawyer must not engage in fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation in his representation of a client. MR 8.4(c). Lawyers are generally required to report professional misconduct by other lawyers to the appropriate disciplinary authorities. MR 8.3. To protect the impartiality of decision makers, rules of professional ethics prohibit lawyers from having improper contacts with either judges or jurors. MR 3.5. At times the lawyer’s duty to the system of justice may even override the lawyer’s duty to his client. Thus, sometimes a lawyer must reveal legal authority that is damaging to his client’s case, even though opposing counsel has failed to find the authority. MR 3.3(a)(2). In some situations a lawyer may even be required to reveal confidential information received from a client in order to rectify fraud committed by the client or another person. MR 1.6, 3.3. See Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U.S. 157 (1986) (defendant in criminal case not denied constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel when lawyer informed client that he would report client’s intention to commit perjury to the court).</p>
<p id="037ad938-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, a number of rules of professional ethics impose restrictions on the ways in which lawyers may obtain business. Traditionally, the legal profession has considered professional advertising or solicitation as ethically improper. In 1976 the U.S. Supreme Court ushered in a period of dramatic change in the rules dealing with delivery of legal services when it held that advertising of the price and availability of routine legal services (uncontested divorces, for example) was protected under the first amendment and could not be prohibited by rules of professional conduct. Bates &amp; O’Steen v. State Bar, 433 U.S. 350 (1977). Since then, the Court has decided a number of cases that have expanded the first amendment protection for lawyer advertising. A review of such cases can be found in Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 515 U.S. 618 (1995) (holding by 5-4 decision that state could ban attorneys from sending direct-mail solicitations to disaster victims or relatives for 30 days after incident). Because of <span title="634" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-634">p. 634</span>these cases, the rules of ethics dealing with advertising have been liberalized, and lawyer advertising on television, through the Internet, and other media has exploded, although restrictions remain in a number of states. MR 7.1, 7.2, 7.3. Regulation of advertising and solicitation by attorneys will undoubtedly remain a subject of debate and litigation for years to come.</p>

<p id="037aff50-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Park 100 appeals the trial court’s finding that James and Nancy Kartes are not liable for unpaid rent under a personal guaranty of lease. We affirm.</p>
<p id="037aff51-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b><span class="epub-small-caps">Facts</span></b></p>
<p id="037aff52-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1984, James and Nancy Kartes were part-owners of Kartes Video Communications, Inc. (KVC) in Indianapolis. The company was growing rapidly and required larger operating facilities. Robert Scannell, a representative of the Park 100 industrial complex in Indianapolis, contacted the Karteses and marketed facilities in Park 100 that KVC could lease. After discussing the general requirements and terms for the new facilities, James Kartes delegated all of the lease negotiations to David Kaplan, a KVC senior vice-president.</p>
<p id="037aff53-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Kaplan and Scannell worked out the details for KVC’s lease of Building 107 in Park 100. Park 100 provided a lease agreement form to KVC. The lease did not include any provisions for a personal guaranty of the lease and a personal guaranty was never mentioned during any of the lease negotiations. KVC’s attorney approved the lease and Kaplan signed and delivered the lease to Scannell on or before July 27, 1984. KVC made preparations to move its operations into Building 107 over the weekend of July 28-29, 1984.</p>
<p id="037aff54-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On Friday, July 27, 1984, the evening before KVC was to move into Building 107, Scannell went to KVC’s offices at 5:00 p.m. and found the Karteses getting into their car to leave for the day. Scannell told the Karteses that he had “lease papers” for them to sign. James Kartes explained that they were late for their daughter’s wedding rehearsal and asked if the matter could wait until the following Monday. Scannell informed the Karteses that the matter could not wait and that KVC could not move into Building 107 until the papers were signed.</p>
<p id="037aff55-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Karteses and Scannell then went into KVC’s building, where Scannell produced a document entitled “Lease Agreement.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10D73_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10D73_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">1</a></span> From the lobby of the <span title="635" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-635">p. 635</span>building, James Kartes telephoned Kaplan, who was in another part of the building, and asked if the lease agreement had been approved by KVC’s lawyer. Scannell remained silent. Upon ending his discussion with Kaplan, James Kartes asked where he was to sign the document. Scannell opened the papers to the signature page and the Karteses both signed the document. The Karteses, being officers of the corporation, did not think it unusual that their signatures would be required on the lease. Scannell never told the Karteses that what they were signing was actually a personal guaranty of lease.</p>
<p id="037b2667-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Years later, Park 100 sent the Karteses a “Tenant Agreement” that included an estoppel certificate. At this time the Karteses first learned of the personal guaranty of lease. They immediately disavowed the guaranty and refused to affirm that portion of the “Tenant Agreement.”</p>
<p id="037b2668-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Eventually, the Kartes sold their interest in KVC to Saffron Associates, which subsequently failed to make rent payments to Park 100. Park 100 brought suit to collect the unpaid rent from the Karteses under the personal guaranty.</p>

<p id="037b266a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Park 100 raises numerous issues and arguments on appeal. We find that one issue is dispositive of this matter: whether the trial court erred in finding that Park 100 used fraudulent means to procure the signatures of the Karteses on the guaranty of lease.</p>
<p id="037b266b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b><span class="epub-small-caps">Discussion</span></b></p>
<p id="037b266c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Upon the motion of Park 100, the trial court entered thorough and well-reasoned Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law. When the trial court enters special Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law pursuant to a motion by a party, this court employs a two-tiered standard of review. First, we must determine whether the findings support the judgment. The second inquiry is whether the conclusions and judgment are clearly erroneous based on the facts as found by the trial court. American Cyanamid Co. v. Stephen (1993), Ind. App., 623 N.E.2d 1065, 1070.</p>
<p id="037b266d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court found that Park 100 obtained the signatures of the Karteses on the personal guaranty of lease through fraudulent means. Under Indiana law, the elements of actual fraud are as follows:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-parenlistdecimal">
<li class=""><p id="037b266e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A material misrepresentation of past or existing fact by the party to be charged, which</p></li>

<p id="037b4d83-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Pugh’s IGA v. Super Food Services, Inc. (1988), Ind. App., 531 N.E.2d 1194, 1197, reh’g denied, trans. denied. In its findings and conclusions, the trial court found: (1) The statements made by Scannell, Park 100’s agent, that the personal guaranty was “lease papers” and that KVC could not move into the building until the papers were signed, were each misrepresentations of material facts; <span title="636" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-636">p. 636</span>(2) Scannell knew that the document he presented for the Karteses’ signatures was a guaranty and, therefore, knowingly made false misrepresentations; and (3) the Karteses, through the use of ordinary care and diligence, believed that the document they were signing was a lease, and reasonably relied upon Scannell’s statements to their detriment.</p>
<p id="037b4d84-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The evidence and testimony presented at trial supports these findings and conclusions. A guaranty of lease was never discussed during the lease negotiations, and the lease agreement makes no reference to a guaranty. The document that Scannell presented to the Karteses was entitled “Lease Agreement” and Scannell never told the Karteses that they were signing a personal guaranty of lease, even when he overheard the telephone conversation in which Mr. Kartes asked Kaplan if the lease agreement had been approved by KVC’s lawyer.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10DC5_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10DC5_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">3</a></span></p>
<p id="037b4d86-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Park 100 argues that the Karteses failed to prove the third element of actual fraud, that of reliance. Park 100 summarily argues that one’s reliance upon a material misrepresentation must be justified and, in an arm’s-length relationship involving knowledgeable business people such as the Karteses, such reliance is misplaced. Park 100 concludes that the Karteses had a duty to read the document that they signed and cannot avoid their obligations under the agreement by claiming ignorance of its terms.</p>
<p id="037b4d87-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Generally, parties are obligated to know the terms of the agreement they are signing, and cannot avoid their obligations under the agreement due to a failure to read it. W.T. Rawleigh Co. v. Snider (1935), 207 Ind. 686, 690, 194 N.E. 356, 358; Givan v. Masterson (1898), 152 Ind. 127, 130, 51 N.E. 237, 238. However, where one employs misrepresentation to induce a party’s obligation under a contract, one cannot bind the party to the terms of the agreement.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="037b4d88-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It has many times been held, and is a well-settled rule of law, that a contract of guaranty cannot be enforced by the guarantee, where the guarantor has been induced to enter into the contract by fraudulent misrepresentations or concealment on the part of the guarantee.</p>

<p id="037b4d8a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Scannell misrepresented the personal guaranty as “lease papers,” and in furtherance of this misrepresentation, the personal guaranty was disguised under the title of “Lease Agreement.” We are not persuaded by Park 100’s argument that the Karteses cannot prove actual fraud because the Karteses should have known better than to rely on Scannell’s representations.</p>
<p id="037b4d8b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Whether one has the right to rely depends largely on the facts of the case.” Fire Ins. Exchange v. Bell (1994), Ind. App., 634 N.E.2d 517, 522, <i>aff’d in part, vacated in part,</i> 643 N.E.2d 310. When Scannell presented the “lease papers,” Mr. Kartes telephoned Kaplan.

Exchange, 634 N.E.2d at 521. The evidence supports the trial court’s finding that the Karteses acted with ordinary care and diligence.</p>

Wolfeld v. Hanika (1932), 95 Ind. App. 44, 179 N.E. 178. The evidence supports the trial court’s conclusion that Park 100 obtained the signatures of the Karteses on the personal guaranty of lease through fraudulent means, and the findings support the judgment.

<li class=""><p id="037b74a2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Fraud in the execution.</i> The <i>Park 100</i> case differs significantly from the two previous cases in this section. In both <i>Syester</i> and <i>Hill</i> the parties alleging fraud presumably understood the terms of the written contracts that they signed but alleged that they were fraudulently induced to enter the agreements by false statements or material nondisclosures. The Karteses, however, alleged that they were misled regarding the content of the document that they executed or signed. As to the latter type of fraud, Restatement (Second) §163 provides:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="037b74a3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If a misrepresentation as to the character or essential terms of a proposed contract induces conduct that appears to be a manifestation of assent by one who neither knows nor has reasonable opportunity to know of the character or essential terms of the proposed contract, his conduct is not effective as a manifestation of assent.</p>

<p id="037b74a4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Comment <i>a</i> goes on to state that that section applies when the misrepresentation relates to the very nature of the contract itself and not just one of its nonessential terms. See, e.g., Rosenthal v. Great Western Fin. Securities Corp., 926 P.2d 1061, 1073 (Cal. 1996) (discussing difference between “fraud in the execution” where the party is deceived as to the nature of the writing and “fraud in the inducement” where the party knows what he is signing but does so as the result of misrepresentations). Cf. Restatement (Second) §166 (assenting party may request “reformation” of writing to express actual terms of the agreement when misled about contents).</p>

Eurice Brothers case from Chapter 2. Is the availability of relief for fraud in the execution consistent with the notion of a “duty to read” that traditionally binds parties to signed agreements whether the agreement is read or not? In TufAmerica, Inc. v. Codigo Music LLC, 162 F. Supp. 3d 295 (S.D.N.Y. 2016), the court, applying New York law, stated that fraud in the execution requires a showing of “excusable ignorance of the written terms which may be proven by presenting evidence that someone secretly changed an important term of the contract before the ignorant party signed it, and that the ignorant party lacked a reasonable opportunity to learn of the change before signing.” Id., at 326-327. The court found a triable issue of fraud in the execution based on an allegation that four earlier drafts of contracts conveying property rights in music had material terms that were drastically and inexplicably changed in the final written contract to the benefit of the drafting party.

<p id="037b9bbd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have seen in our earlier study of the doctrine of consideration that courts have generally regarded that doctrine as being ill-suited to policing the “fairness” of a contract. So long as a transaction appears to have been a genuine exchange, it will not be regarded as unenforceable “for lack of consideration” unless the values exchanged are so grossly unbalanced as to suggest some bargaining defect, such as one party’s lack of mental capacity. (Recall the <i>Sparrow</i> case.) And of course various types of bargaining misconduct such as fraud or duress are likely in fact to produce unequal bargains, which the injured party may be able to avoid because of those factors. (She may even be able to recover damages under the law of torts.) But what of the case where various elements — including, but not necessarily limited to, imbalance of bargaining <span title="639" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-639">p. 639</span>power in one or more senses — have resulted in an agreement which appears to be extremely unfair, and yet none of the “defensive doctrines” seems squarely to apply? Must a court treat this like any ordinary contract, and enforce it according to its terms?</p>
<p id="037b9bbe-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Over the years, various legal systems, including our own, have grappled with that question. (This historical process is described in more detail in the Comment below.) Since the mid-twentieth century, activated in part by the example of Uniform Commercial Code §2-302, our law of contract generally has been willing to entertain the argument that a given exchange agreement may be unenforceable (in whole or in part) because enforcing it would be just too shocking to the conscience of the court — in short, it is an “unconscionable” contract. The UCC, the Restatement (Second) of Contracts (in §208), and many judges have struggled to define or at least give some predictable content to this amorphous concept.</p>
<p id="037b9bbf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The inherent vagueness of the unconscionability concept has resulted in a number of issues for courts to resolve. How should a court determine when an agreement is unconscionable? To what extent does the doctrine allow a court to refuse to enforce a contract simply because the contract is harsh, even if the bargaining process has not otherwise been defective? Does the doctrine apply to commercial as well as consumer transactions?</p>

<p id="037b9bca-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellee, Walker-Thomas Furniture Company, operates a retail furniture store in the District of Columbia. During the period from 1957 to 1962 each appellant in these cases purchased a number of household items from Walker-Thomas, for which payment was to be made in installments. The terms of each purchase were contained in a printed form contract which set forth the value of the purchased item and purported to lease the item to appellant for a stipulated monthly rent payment. The contract then provided, in substance, that title would remain in Walker-Thomas until the total of all the monthly payments made equaled the stated value of the item, at which time appellants could take title. In the event of a default in the payment of any monthly installment, Walker-Thomas could repossess the item.</p>
<p id="037b9bcb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The contract further provided that “the amount of each periodical installment payment to be made by [purchaser] to the Company under this present lease shall be inclusive of and not in addition to the amount of each installment payment to be made by [purchaser] under such prior leases, bills or accounts; <i>and all payments now and hereafter made by [purchaser] shall be credited pro rata on all outstanding leases, bills and accounts</i> due the Company by [purchaser] at the time each such payment is made.” (Emphasis added.) The effect of this rather obscure provision was to keep a balance due on every item purchased until the balance due on all items, whenever purchased, was liquidated. As a result, the debt incurred at the time of <span title="640" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-640">p. 640</span>purchase of each item was secured by the right to repossess all the items previously purchased by the same purchaser, and each new item purchased automatically became subject to a security interest arising out of the previous dealings.</p>
<p id="037b9bcc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On May 12, 1962, appellant Thorne purchased an item described as a Daveno, three tables, and two lamps, having total stated value of $391.10. Shortly thereafter, he defaulted on his monthly payments and appellee sought to replevy all the items purchased since the first transaction in 1958. Similarly, on April 17, 1962, appellant Williams bought a stereo set of stated value of $514.95.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10ECE_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10ECE_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">1</a></span> She too defaulted shortly thereafter, and appellee sought to replevy all the items purchased since December, 1957. The Court of General Sessions granted judgment for appellee. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals affirmed, and we granted appellants’ motion for leave to appeal to this court.</p>
<p id="037b9bce-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants’ principal contention, rejected by both the trial and the appellate courts below, is that these contracts, or at least some of them, are unconscionable and, hence, not enforceable. In its opinion in Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Company, 198 A.2d 914, 916 (1964), the District of Columbia Court of Appeals explained its rejection of this contention as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="037bc2df-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant’s second argument presents a more serious question. The record reveals that prior to the last purchase appellant had reduced the balance in her account to $164. The last purchase, a stereo set, raised the balance due to $678. Significantly, at the time of this and the preceding purchases, appellee was aware of appellant’s financial position. The reverse side of the stereo contract listed the name of appellant’s social worker and her $218 monthly stipend from the government. Nevertheless, with full knowledge that appellant had to feed, clothe and support both herself and seven children on this amount, appellee sold her a $514 stereo set.</p>
<p id="037bc2e0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We cannot condemn too strongly appellee’s conduct. It raises serious questions of sharp practice and irresponsible business dealings. A review of the legislation in the District of Columbia affecting retail sales and the pertinent decisions of the highest court in this jurisdiction disclose, however, no ground upon which this court can declare the contracts in question contrary to public policy. We note that were the Maryland Retail Installment Sales Act, Art. 83 §§128-153, or its equivalent, in force in the District of Columbia, we could grant appellant appropriate relief. We think Congress should consider corrective legislation to protect the public from such exploitive contracts as were utilized in the case at bar.</p>

<span title="641" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-641">p. 641</span>
<p id="037bc2e1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not agree that the court lacked the power to refuse enforcement to contracts found to be unconscionable. In other jurisdictions, it has been held as a matter of common law that unconscionable contracts are not enforceable.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10EE9_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10EE9_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">2</a></span> While no decision of this court so holding has been found, the notion that an unconscionable bargain should not be given full enforcement is by no means novel. In Scott v. United States, 79 U.S. (12 Wall.) 443, 445, 20 L. Ed. 438 (1870), the Supreme Court stated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="037bc2e3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If a contract be unreasonable and unconscionable, but not void for fraud, a court of law will give to the party who sues for its breach damages, not according to its letter, but only such as he is equitably entitled to. . . . </p>
</div>
<p id="037bc2e4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since we have never adopted or rejected such a rule, the question here presented is actually one of first impression.</p>
<p id="037bc2e5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress has recently enacted the Uniform Commercial Code, which specifically provides that the court may refuse to enforce a contract which it finds to be unconscionable at the time it was made. 28 D.C. Code §2-302 (Supp. IV 1965). The enactment of this section, which occurred subsequent to the contracts here in suit, does not mean that the common law of the District of Columbia was otherwise at the time of enactment, nor does it preclude the court from adopting a similar rule in the exercise of its powers to develop the common law for the District of Columbia. In fact, in view of the absence of prior authority on the point, we consider the congressional adoption of §2-302 persuasive authority for following the rationale of the cases from which the section is explicitly derived.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10EFF_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10EFF_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">5</a></span> Accordingly, we hold that where the element of unconscionability is present at the time a contract is made, the contract should not be enforced.</p>
<p id="037bc2e7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unconscionability has generally been recognized to include an absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties together with contract terms which are unreasonably favorable to the other party.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10F09_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10F09_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">6</a></span> Whether a meaningful choice is present in a particular case can only be determined by consideration of all the circumstances surrounding the transaction. In many cases the meaningfulness of the choice is negated by a gross inequality of bargaining power.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10F0F_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10F0F_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">7</a></span> The manner in which the contract was entered is also relevant to this <span title="642" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-642">p. 642</span>consideration. Did each party to the contract, considering his obvious education or lack of it, have a reasonable opportunity to understand the terms of the contract, or were the important terms hidden in a maze of fine print and minimized by deceptive sales practices? Ordinarily, one who signs an agreement without full knowledge of its terms might be held to assume the risk that he has entered a one-sided bargain.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10F18_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10F18_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">8</a></span> But when a party of little bargaining power, and hence little real choice, signs a commercially unreasonable contract with little or no knowledge of its terms, it is hardly likely that his consent, or even an objective manifestation of his consent, was ever given to all the terms. In such a case the usual rule that the terms of the agreement are not to be questioned<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10F28_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10F28_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">9</a></span> should be abandoned and the court should consider whether the terms of the contract are so unfair that enforcement should be withheld.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10F2E_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10F2E_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">10</a></span></p>
<p id="037be9fe-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In determining reasonableness or fairness, the primary concern must be with the terms of the contract considered in light of the circumstances existing when the contract was made. The test is not simple, nor can it be mechanically applied. The terms are to be considered “in the light of the general commercial background and the commercial needs of the particular trade or case.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10F37_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10F37_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">11</a></span> Corbin suggests the test as being whether the terms are “so extreme as to appear unconscionable according to the mores and business practices of the time and place.” 1 Corbin, op. cit. supra note 2.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10F3D_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10F3D_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">12</a></span> We think this formulation correctly states the test to be applied in those cases where no meaningful choice was exercised upon entering the contract.</p>
<p id="037bea01-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the trial court and the appellate court did not feel that enforcement could be refused, no findings were made on the possible unconscionability of the contracts in these cases.

<p id="037bea04-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District of Columbia Court of Appeals obviously was as unhappy about the situation here presented as any of us can possibly be. Its opinion in the <i>Williams</i> case, quoted in the majority text, concludes: “We think Congress should consider corrective legislation to protect the public from such exploitive contracts as were utilized in the case at bar.”</p>
<p id="037bea05-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">My view is thus summed up by an able court which made no finding that there had actually been sharp practice. Rather the appellant seems to have known precisely where she stood.</p>
<p id="037bea06-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are many aspects of public policy here involved. What is a luxury to some may seem an outright necessity to others. Is public oversight to be required of the expenditures of relief funds? A washing machine, e.g., in the hands of a relief client might become a fruitful source of income. Many relief clients may well need credit, and certain business establishments will take long chances on the sale of items, expecting their pricing policies will afford a degree of protection commensurate with the risk. Perhaps a remedy when necessary will be found within the provisions of the “Loan Shark” law, D.C. Code §§26-601 et seq. (1961).</p>
<p id="037bea07-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I mention such matters only to emphasize the desirability of a cautious approach to any such problem, particularly since the law for so long has allowed parties such great latitude in making their own contracts.

<li class=""><p id="037c111b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Procedural and substantive unconscionability.</i> The <i>Williams</i> court states that unconscionability consists of “an absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties together with contract terms which are unreasonably favorable to the other party” and goes on to note that conspicuousness and intelligibility of a clause will also be relevant. In one of the earliest assessments of UCC §2-302, Professor Leff coined the terms <i>procedural unconscionability</i> and <i>substantive unconscionability</i> to identify what he perceived as two key aspects of the new provision. Arthur Allen Leff, Unconscionability and the Code—The Emperor’s New Clause, 115 U. Pa. L. Rev. 485, 487-488 (1967). Read together, the Leff article and the <i>Williams</i> case indicate that procedural unconscionability may refer to either lack of choice by one party or some defect in the bargaining process (such as quasi-fraud or quasi-duress) and that substantive unconscionability relates to the fairness of the terms of the resulting bargain. Many courts now use these concepts as a framework for analysis of unconscionability problems, generally requiring a showing of both procedural and substantive elements. See, e.g., FI–Tampa, LLC v. Kelly–Hall, 135 So. 3d 563, 567 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2014) (requiring evidence of both elements); The McCaffrey <span title="644" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-644">p. 644</span>Group, Inc. v. Superior Court, 169 Cal. Rptr. 3d 766 (Cal. Ct. App. 2014) (both elements of unconscionability required under “sliding scale”; if more of one element present, less may be required of the other). But see Maxwell v. Fidelity Financial Services, Inc., 907 P.2d 51, 58 (Ariz. 1995) (agreeing with jurisdictions that accept substantive unconscionability alone as sufficient and leaving open the question of whether procedural alone would be enough); Balogh v. Balogh, 332 P.3d 631, 643-644 (Haw. 2014) (under certain circumstances, an “impermissibly one-sided agreement” may be unconscionable even if there is no unfair surprise or procedural unconscionability).</p>
<p id="037c111c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While Professor Leff agreed that the contract in <i>Williams</i> was procedurally unconscionable, he criticized the court’s analysis of the substantive aspect of the transaction as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="037c111d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How does that test apply to the <i>Williams</i> facts? What is it about Mrs. Williams’ contract which is “unconscionable?” Surprisingly, the answer is not clear, even about <i>what</i> in the contract is bad. It seems, however, that there are two possibilities. First, it may be that the provision by which each item purchased became security for all items purchased was the objectionable feature of the contract. Or it might be that the furniture company sold this expensive stereo set to this particular party which forms the unconscionability of the contract. If the vice is the add-on clause, then one encounters the now-familiar problem: such a clause is hardly such a moral outrage as by itself meets Judge Wright’s standard of being “so extreme as to appear unconscionable according to the mores and business practices of the time and place.” . . . Of the thirty-seven jurisdictions which have statutes regulating retail installment sales, only one has a provision making add-on clauses impermissible. In such circumstances it does seem a bit much to find “so extreme as to appear unconscionable according to the mores and business practices of the time and place” an add-on clause in the District of Columbia which is used and statutorily permitted almost everyplace else, including contiguous Maryland. One’s gorge can hardly be expected to rise with such nice geographic selectivity.</p>
<p id="037c111e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If one is not convinced that the unconscionability inheres in the add-on provision, it may be argued that it inheres in the contract as a whole, in the act of having sold this expensive item to a poor person knowing of her poverty. This is quite clearly the primary significance of the case to some of the commentators. . . . </p>

Do Professor Leff’s stated choices exhaust the alternatives? Or is it possible that unfairness lies in selling “this expensive item” (the stereo) and others as well, “to a poor person, knowing of her poverty,” <i>pursuant to a contract with an add-on clause</i>? Failing to make add-on clauses illegal per se is not necessarily the same as giving them a vote of thanks; for instance, the Uniform Consumer Credit Code (UCCC or U3C), promulgated by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws after the <i>Williams</i> decision, permits the use of add-on clauses in consumer credit sales but requires that moneys paid by the buyer be allocated <span title="645" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-645">p. 645</span>to the goods purchased in the order of their purchase, rather than pro rata to all goods as yet unpaid for.

In Judge Wright’s opinion, in footnotes 7 and 12, he quotes the old English formulation of “intrinsic fraud” as being a bargain that “. . . no man in his senses and not under delusion would make . . . , and no honest or fair man would accept. . . .” Although this language is sometimes quoted by American courts in discussing unconscionability, some have questioned whether it is a useful test.

It is sufficient if the provision is grossly unreasonable and against our public policy. . . . The repetition of this unhelpful terminology from a bygone age only serves to confuse the unconscionability issues without serving any constructive purpose.

UCCC §5.108 calls for assessment of a number of elements including whether the seller believes the consumer is likely to default on the obligation, whether the consumer will receive substantial benefit from the transaction, gross disparity between the contract and market price, and whether the seller has knowingly taken advantage of a consumer’s bargaining disadvantage due to mental impairment, lack of education, or similar factors. The Kansas Supreme Court adopted a balancing test in Wille v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., 549 P.2d 903 (Kan. 1976), weighing factors such as the use of a standard form contract, limitation on available remedies for breach, use of inconspicuous or incomprehensible terms, overall imbalance in the bargain, exploitation of a party’s lack of experience or education, and inequality of bargaining or economic power.

<li class=""><p id="037c1124-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Factual context for <b>Williams</b>.</i> Is it possible that the judges in <i>Williams</i>, and perhaps some current readers of the case, are influenced by stereotypes that may come to mind based on the limited facts that are given in the Court of Appeals opinion? While the court does not reveal Williams’s race or ethnicity, educational background, or work experience, the majority opinion reports her monthly income of $218 and the dissent indicates that she received “relief funds.” What common assumptions about Williams might be made on the basis of that information and how might they affect the resolution of the case? Would it make a difference to the outcome of the case if Williams happened to be an educated person with business experience who suddenly found herself <span title="646" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-646">p. 646</span>with seven children to raise as a single parent because of the accidental death of her husband? Professor Muriel Morisey Spence suggests that possible scenario and warns that discussion of the <i>Williams</i> case may often reinforce stereotypes concerning gender, race, and class. Muriel Morisey Spence, Teaching Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co., 3 Temple Pol. &amp; C.R. L. Rev. 89 (1994). Professor Spence highlights the fact that Williams appears to have made timely payments for about five years before defaulting on the account for reasons not revealed. Id. at 96. Moreover, do you think that even a well-educated person would have understood the add-on clause and been able to protect herself against it? (Did you understand the clause the first time you read it?)</p>
<p id="037c1125-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Additional background facts about the appellants, Mrs. Williams and the Thornes, can in fact be gathered from the lower court opinions before the cases were consolidated, Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co., 198 A.2d 914 (D.C. 1964) and Thorne v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co., 198 A.2d 914 (D.C. 1964). Further information on the case has surfaced over the years. See Eben Colby, What Did the Doctrine of Unconscionability Do to the Walker-Thomas Furniture Company? 34 Conn. L. Rev. 625 (2002). From those collective sources, it becomes clear that the Thornes and Mrs. Williams did pay their respective accounts faithfully for four to five years before eventually defaulting. While the cause for Mrs. Williams’s default is not clear, it appears that illness led to the Thornes’ default. The lower court reports that Mrs. Williams was a person of limited education and Colby reports that Mr. Thorne had a third-grade education. Colby also reports that Walker-Thomas was known to have a practice of repossessing goods, having filed “approximately one hundred writs of replevin each year for many years preceding Williams’s litigation.” 34 Conn. L. Rev. at 652. The lower court opinion also reflects that the store sold most of the goods through door-to-door sales, reporting that Mrs. Williams “testified that most of the purchases were made at her home; that the contracts were signed in blank; that she did not read the instruments; and that she was not provided with a copy. She admitted, however, that she did not ask anyone to read or explain the contracts to her.” 198 A.2d at 915. Mrs. Williams’s purchases included sheets, curtains, toys, rugs, chairs, a chest of drawers, beds, mattresses, a washing machine, and, finally, the stereo set. Id. Do any of these additional facts affect your opinion about the applicability of the unconscionability doctrine to the cases?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="037c1126-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Price term unconscionability.</i> In <i>Williams</i> the court considered whether the doctrine of unconscionability should apply to an “add-on” clause, a part of the contract that consumers are unlikely to read or understand. Should the doctrine also apply to provisions of the contract on which consumers usually do focus their attention, such as the price term in a sales contact or the monthly fee in a rental agreement? Whether the drafters of UCC §2-302 intended the section to be used to police the price term of a contract is unclear from its history. Nonetheless, a number of cases have held consumer contracts unconscionable because of excessive price. E.g., Ahern v. Knecht, 563 N.E.2d 787 (Ill. App. Ct. 1990) (plumber had charged plaintiff $762 for services worth at most <span title="647" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-647">p. 647</span>$150; plaintiff given judgment for refund); American Home Improvement, Inc. v. MacIver, 201 A.2d 886 (N.H. 1964) (contract for home improvement in the amount of $2,658, which included $809 in interest and $806 for sales commission, was unconscionable); Frostifresh Corp. v. Reynoso, 274 N.Y.S.2d 757 (Dist. Ct. 1966) (sale of refrigerator-freezer costing $348 for price of $1,396.10 held unconscionable where negotiations were conducted in Spanish, contract was written in English, and salesman represented that unit would pay for itself through $25 referral fees when neighbors bought the same item). Moreover, both the Restatement and the Uniform Consumer Credit Code indicate that excessive price may be a basis of unconscionability. Restatement (Second) §208, Comment <i>c</i>; UCCC §5.108(4)(c).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="037c3837-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i><b>Dohrmann</b> revisited</i>. Recall the <i>Dohrmann</i> case in Chapter 2 in which the plaintiff sought to enforce a written contract providing for his receipt of $5.5 million in assets in exchange for adding the promisor’s family name as a middle name for the plaintiff’s two children. The court in that case held that the plaintiff could not recover due to “gross inadequacy” of consideration, but also noted the presence of other factors that militated against enforcement of the decedent’s promises to the plaintiff. Now that we have studied incapacity, duress, undue influence, misrepresentation, and unconscionability, would any of those doctrines have been stronger reasons than failure of consideration for the court’s refusing to enforce those promises?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="037c3838-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Procedural limits.</i> The court in <i>Williams</i> held that the case must be remanded to the trial court for a determination of whether the clause was unconscionable. Section 2-302 provides that the question of unconscionability is a legal issue to be decided by the court, rather than the trier of fact, but only after providing the parties an opportunity to present evidence relevant to the disputed provision. See Vilella v. AT&amp;T, 953 N.Y.S.2d 554 (Sup. Ct. 2012) (where doubt exists about whether contract is unconscionable, the parties must have an opportunity to present evidence at a hearing; however, where significant facts are essentially undisputed court may decide issue without a hearing); Schroeder v. Fageol Motors, Inc., 544 P.2d 20, 24-25 (Wash. 1975) (en banc) (trial court erred in determining unconscionability on summary judgment without giving parties opportunity to present evidence). UCC §2-302 and Restatement (Second) §208 further provide that unconscionability is to be judged as of the time that the contract is made. Accordingly, courts generally emphasize that contracts should not be judged based on developments after the contract was formed. See Boston Helicopter Charter, Inc. v. Augusta Aviation Corp., 767 F. Supp. 363, 375 (D. Mass. 1991); Strand v. U.S. Bank National Association ND, 693 N.W.2d 918, 921 (N.D. 2005).</p></li>

Professor Robert Hillman advocates, in essence, the use of traditional doctrines, such as duress, undue influence, or fraud, whenever applicable, because they are more specific than the unconscionability doctrine and would limit application of the doctrine to extreme cases that truly shock the conscience.

Section 2-302, 67 Cornell L. Rev. 1 (1981). In a similar vein, Professor Prince has taken aim specifically at the “lack of meaningful choice” test adopted in <i>Williams</i> and widely used by the courts. Harry G. Prince, Unconscionability in California: A Need for Restraint and Consistency, 46 Hastings L.J. 459 (1995). Prince observes that the quasi-fraud form of procedural unconscionability involves terms that are likely hidden or unintelligible if found, and therefore relates to the common law forms of bargaining misbehavior. Application of the lack of meaningful choice test, Prince suggests, is much more vague and difficult, except in cases of extreme necessity, and results in further obfuscation of an already imprecise concept.

<p id="037c383a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professor Richard A. Epstein has offered a critique of unconscionability that analyzes the economic consequences of a variety of common contractual provisions such as the add-on clause in <i>Williams.</i> He concludes that such clauses normally promote efficiency by reducing transaction costs and benefit both parties. Richard A. Epstein, Unconscionability: A Critical Reappraisal, 18 J.L. &amp; Econ. 293 (1975). Epstein asserts that the add-on clause provides an efficient means for the seller to obtain additional security to make the transaction feasible for both parties and should not be deemed unconscionable. Id. at 307. He does allow, however, that the unconscionability doctrine can serve an economically useful purpose when applied to agreements made under circumstances where coercive behavior (fraud, duress, etc.) was likely but difficult to prove. In such cases, Epstein suggests that the application of the doctrine advances the principle of freedom of contract while reducing judicial costs. Id. at 303-305.

Nonetheless, she agrees with Professor Knapp’s view expressed in several articles that the doctrine of unconscionability serves a fundamental role in promoting fairness in contractual relationships. See Charles L. Knapp, Opting Out or Copping Out, 40 Loyola of L.A. L. Rev. 95, 126-135 (2006) and Blowing the Whistle on Mandatory Arbitration: Unconscionability as a Signaling Device, 46 San Diego L. Rev. 609, 610-614 (2009). Professor Beh proposes several modifications and developments to strengthen the concept: recognition of unconscionability as both a cause of action and a defense, reliance on principles established under the doctrine of illegality when dealing with claims of unconscionability, focus on the ethical implications of drafting clauses that have a “stench” of unconscionability, and judicial acceptance of unconscionability as a “standard of essential contracting fairness that has been entrusted to the common law of contracts.” See Hazel G. Beh, Curing the Infirmities of the Unconscionability Doctrine, in Contract Law Present and Future: A Symposium to Honor Professor Charles L.

<p id="037c383d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In civil law countries, the idea that a grossly unfair bargain should be unenforceable has a long history. Under Roman law, which greatly influenced the development of the civil law, the doctrine of “laesio enormis” provided that a party could rescind a land sale transaction if the disproportion between the values exchanged was greater than two to one. Modern civil law countries, such as Germany and France, recognize a number of doctrines that allow courts to refuse to enforce grossly unfair bargains. John P. Dawson, Duress and the Fair Exchange in French and German Law, 11 Tul. L. Rev. 345, 12 Tul. L. Rev. 42 (1937); John P. Dawson, Unconscionable Coercion: The German Version, 89 Harv. L. Rev. 1041 (1976). For example, Section 3.2.7 of the Principles of International Commercial Contracts (see the supplement) provides that a party may avoid a contract because of “gross disparity.” For further discussion see Joseph M. Perillo, UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts: The Black Letter Text and a Review, 63 Fordham L. Rev. 281, 293-294 (1994).</p>
<p id="037c383e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unlike the civil law, the Anglo-American common law did not develop an explicit doctrine for dealing with unfair bargains, but there were a number of grounds that the common law courts could use to avoid enforcing such agreements. In equity a court could deny specific performance or other equitable relief if the price was inadequate or if the one seeking relief had “unclean hands.” See Emily L. Sherwin, Law and Equity in Contract Enforcement, 50 Md. L. Rev. 253 (1991). At law, a court could manipulate doctrines such as consideration, mutual assent, or principles of interpretation to find in favor of a party who was the victim of an unfair bargain. See Joseph M. Perillo, Contracts, §9.38 (7th ed. 2014).</p>
<p id="037c383f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During the first half of the twentieth century, economic and social changes made the problem of enforceability of unfair bargains even more acute. Large commercial enterprises increasingly began using standard form contracts to conduct business transactions. The typical standard form contract contains numerous “boilerplate” provisions that are extremely favorable to the drafting party. Moreover, negotiation of such terms rarely occurs both because the terms are normally not read and also because the form is usually presented on a “take-it-or-leave-it” basis, as exemplified in the <i>C &amp; J Fertilizer</i> case in Chapter 5. Thus, the emergence of the standard form brought into question the concept of mutual assent, a pillar of classical contract law. The same period also witnessed a growing public awareness of the problems of the poor and unsophisticated, potential victims for unscrupulous commercial parties.</p>
<p id="037c3840-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One judicial tool that emerged for dealing with unfair contracts was the doctrine of “unconscionability,” codified in UCC §2-302. Although §2-302 applies strictly only to contracts for the sale of goods, its formulation of the unconscionability standard has been incorporated in the Restatement (Second) §208 and has been regularly applied to all types of contracts. See E. Allan Farnsworth, Contracts §4.28, at 298-299 (4th ed. 2004). The section was drafted to address concerns that the practice of courts’ distorting other doctrinal rules to police for unfairness would produce confusion and unpredictability or, as stated by <span title="650" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-650">p. 650</span>Professor Karl Llewellyn, concern that “[c]overt tools are never reliable tools.” Karl Llewellyn, Book Review, 52 Harv. L. Rev. 700, 703 (1939). Thus, UCC §2-302 was designed to allow courts to examine contracts explicitly for bargaining unfairness.</p>
<p id="037c3841-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a seminal article on the doctrine, Professor Arthur Leff traced the drafting history of UCC §2-302 and demonstrated that in its earliest draft the doctrine was intended to apply only to standard form contracts. In subsequent drafts, the scope and purpose of the section became increasingly vague. As a result, Leff argued, the drafters produced a section that was a pure abstraction, devoid of content. Arthur Allen Leff, Unconscionability and the Code—The Emperor’s New Clause, 115 U. Pa. L. Rev. 485 (1967). Leff also predicted, however, that the courts would likely cure the faults in §2-302 by applying a “smoothing nacre of more or less reasonable applications.” Id. at 558-559. Subsequent writers have concluded that the courts, in fact, have shown considerable restraint in applying the unconscionability doctrine. See, e.g., E. Allan Farnsworth, Developments in Contract Law During the 1980s: The Top Ten, 41 Case W. Res. L. Rev. 203 (1990) (describing unconscionability and related doctrines as an area of “arrested development”); but see Anne Fleming, The Rise and Fall of Unconscionability as the “Law of the Poor,” 102 Geo. L.J. 1383 (2014) and Charles L. Knapp, Blowing the Whistle on Mandatory Arbitration: Unconscionability as a Signaling Device, 436 San Diego L. Rev. 609, 610-614 (2009) (arguing that court decisions applying the concept of unconscionability spurred specific legislative reactions).</p>

<p id="037c5f5f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Over the next several months, there were additional contacts between petitioners and persons affiliated with the production of the program, including in-person interviews and the filming of a casting tape. By early 2005, petitioners and the Leomitis were chosen to participate in the program in which the Leomitis’ home would be completely renovated.</p>
<p id="037c5f60-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On February 1, 2005, a Lock and Key producer sent by Federal Express to each of the petitioners and to the Leomitis an “Agreement and Release” for their signatures.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN110AA_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N110AA_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">2</a></span> The Agreement and Release contains 24 single-spaced pages and 72 numbered paragraphs. Attached to it were several pages of exhibits, including an authorization for release of medical information, an emergency medical release, and, as exhibit C, a one-page document entitled “Release.” To avoid confusion with the one-page exhibit C Release, we refer to the 24-page Agreement and Release simply as the “Agreement,” and to exhibit C as the “Release.”</p>
<p id="037c5f62-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the top of the first page of the Agreement, the following appears in large and underlined print: “NOTE: DO NOT SIGN THIS UNTIL YOU HAVE READ IT COMPLETELY.” The second-to-last numbered paragraph also states in pertinent part: “I have been given ample opportunity to read, and I have carefully read, this entire agreement. . . . I certify that I have made such an investigation of the facts pertinent to this Agreement and of all the matters pertaining thereto as I have deemed necessary. . . . I represent and warrant that I have reviewed this document with my own legal counsel prior to signing (or, IN THE <span title="652" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-652">p. 652</span>ALTERNATIVE, although I have been given a reasonable opportunity to discuss this Agreement with counsel of my choice, I have voluntarily declined such opportunity).”</p>
<p id="037c5f63-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The last section of the Agreement, which includes 12 numbered paragraphs, is entitled “MISCELLANEOUS.” None of the paragraphs in that section contains a heading or title. Paragraph 69 contains the following arbitration provision:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="037c5f64-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">69.

</div>
<p id="037c5f65-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is nothing in the Agreement that brings the reader’s attention to the arbitration provision. Although a different font is used occasionally to highlight certain terms in the Agreement, that is not the case with the paragraph containing the arbitration provision. Six paragraphs in the Agreement contain a box for the petitioners to initial; initialing is not required for the arbitration provision. . . . </p>
<p id="037c5f66-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The one-page Release is typed in a smaller font than the Agreement. It consists of four, single-spaced paragraphs, the middle of which contains the following arbitration clause: “I agree that any and all disputes or controversies arising under this Release or any of its terms, any effort by any party to enforce, interpret, construe, rescind, terminate or annul this Release, or any provision thereof, shall be resolved exclusively by binding arbitration before a single, neutral arbitrator, who shall be a retired judge of a state or federal court. All arbitration proceedings shall be conducted under the auspices of the American Arbitration Association, under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, through its Los Angeles, California office. I agree that the arbitration proceedings, testimony, discovery and documents filed in the course of such proceedings, including the fact that the arbitration is being conducted, will be treated as confidential. . . .”</p>
<p id="037c5f67-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no evidence that any discussions took place between petitioners and any representative of the television defendants regarding either the Agreement or the Release, or that any of the television defendants directly imposed any deadline by which petitioners were required to execute the documents.</p>
<p id="037c5f68-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On February 5, 2005, a field producer from Lock and Key and a location manager for the program went to the Leomitis’ home and met with the Leomitis. Although physically present at the house, petitioners did not participate in the meeting. During the meeting, one of the Leomitis asked about the documents they had received, and the producer and location manager advised the Leomitis <span title="653" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-653">p. 653</span>that they should read the documents carefully, call if they had questions, and then execute and return the documents.</p>
<p id="037c5f69-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to Charles, after this meeting, the Leomitis emerged with a packet of documents, which they handed to petitioners. Mrs. Leomiti instructed petitioners to “flip through the pages and sign and initial the document where it contained a signature line or box.” Charles stated that from the time Mrs. Leomiti “handed the document to us and the time we signed it, approximately five to ten minutes passed.” The document contained complex legal terms that he did not understand. He did not know what an arbitration agreement was and did not understand its significance or the legal consequences that could flow from signing it. He did not specifically state whether or not he saw the arbitration provisions contained either in paragraph 69 or the Release before he signed the documents.</p>
<p id="037c5f6a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Each of the petitioners executed the Agreement and signed all exhibits, including the Release.</p>
<p id="037c5f6b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On February 16, 2005, representatives from the show appeared and started to reconstruct the Leomitis’ home. When the new home was completed, it had nine bedrooms, including one for each of the five petitioners. The existing mortgage was also paid off.</p>
<p id="037c5f6c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The program featuring petitioners and the Leomitis was broadcast on Easter Sunday, 2005.</p>
<p id="037c5f6d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners allege that, after the show was first broadcast, the Leomitis informed petitioners that the home was theirs (the Leomitis’), and the Leomitis ultimately forced petitioners to leave. Charles contacted Lock and Key’s field producer and asked for help. The producer responded that he could not assist petitioners. Sometime thereafter, the <i>Extreme Makeover</i> episode was rebroadcast.</p>
<p id="037c5f6e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In August 2005, petitioners filed this action against the television defendants and the Leomitis. According to the record before us, the complaint includes claims for, among other things, intentional and negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract, unfair competition . . . , and false advertising. . . . With respect to the television defendants, the complaint appears to allege that those defendants breached promises to provide petitioners with a home, exploited petitioners, and portrayed petitioners in a false light (by rebroadcasting the episode when they knew the episode no longer reflected petitioners’ living situation).</p>
<p id="037c5f6f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The television defendants petitioned to compel arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) (9 U.S.C. §1 et seq.). The television defendants maintained that all claims against both them and the Leomitis should be arbitrated. The Leomitis joined in the petition.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN110FF_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N110FF_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">5</a></span></p>

<p id="037c8682-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After argument, the trial court issued an order granting the petition in most respects, conditioned on the television defendants paying all arbitration costs. . . . The court . . . cited United States and California Supreme Court decisions holding that under the FAA, where a party seeks to avoid application of an arbitration provision on the ground that the agreement in which the provision is contained is unenforceable, that claim must be considered by the arbitrator, not the court. The trial court also stated that “since defendants have shown that plaintiffs signed the releases having had an opportunity to read them, the arbitration provisions are found by this court to be enforceable.” The court did not address petitioners’ other specific claims of unconscionability, presumably because it construed petitioners’ opposition to the petition to compel arbitration as an attack only on the entire Agreement and one-page Release, not on the arbitration provisions contained in those documents.</p>
<p id="037c8683-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners then filed this writ petition challenging the trial court’s ruling. We issued an alternative writ, received additional briefing from the parties, and heard oral argument.</p>

<p id="037c8686-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court ruled, and petitioners do not dispute, that the enforceability of the arbitration clause is governed by the FAA. Federal law applies to arbitration provisions in contracts involving interstate commerce. (See 9 U.S.C. §2; . . . . ) Numerous cases observe that arbitration is generally favored under both the FAA and California law. (E.g., Balandran v. Labor Ready, Inc. (2004) 124 Cal. App. 4th 1522, 1527 [22 Cal. Rptr. 3d 441]; . . . . ) At the same time, our Supreme Court has emphasized that “although we have spoken of a ‘strong public policy of this state in favor of resolving disputes by arbitration’ [citation], Code of Civil Procedure §1281 makes clear that an arbitration agreement is to be rescinded on the same grounds as other contracts or contract terms. In this respect, arbitration agreements are neither favored nor disfavored, but simply placed on an equal footing with other contracts.” (Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal. 4th 83, 126-127 [99 Cal. Rptr. 2d 745, 6 P.3d 669] (<i>Armendariz</i>); see also Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna (2006) [546 U.S. 440], 163 L. Ed. 2d 1038, 1042, 126 S. Ct. 1204, 1207 (<i>Buckeye</i>). . . . </p>
<p id="037c8687-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, under both the FAA and California law, “arbitration agreements are valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.” (<i>Armendariz</i>, supra, 24 Cal. 4th at p. 98, fn. omitted.)</p>
<p id="037c8688-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One ground is unconscionability, the basis asserted by petitioners below and in this writ proceeding. (See Flores v. Transamerica HomeFirst, Inc. (2001) 93 Cal. App. 4th 846, 856 [113 Cal. Rptr. 2d 376].) “The ‘ “strong public policy of this <span title="655" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-655">p. 655</span>state in favor of resolving disputes by arbitration’ ” does not extend to an arbitration agreement permeated by unconscionability.” (<i>Ibid.</i>) As is frequently the case with inquiries into unconscionability, our analysis begins—although it does not end—with whether the Agreement and Release are contracts of adhesion. (See <i>Armendariz</i>, supra, 24 Cal. 4th at p. 113.) Petitioners contend that they are and that the arbitration provisions are unconscionable. A contract of adhesion is a standardized contract that is imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength and relegates to the other party “ ‘only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.’ ” (<i>Ibid</i>., quoting Neal v. State Farm Ins. Cos. (1961) 188 Cal. App. 2d 690, 694 [10 Cal. Rptr. 781].) Adhesion contracts are routine in modern day commerce, and at least one commentator has suggested they are worthy of neither praise nor condemnation, only analysis. (1 Corbin on Contracts (1993) §1.4, p. 14.) If a court finds a contract to be adhesive, it must then determine whether “‘other factors are present which, under established legal rules—legislative or judicial—operate to render it’” unenforceable. (<i>Armendariz</i>, at p. 113, citing Graham v. Scissor-Tail, Inc. (1981) 28 Cal. 3d 807, 820 [171 Cal. Rptr. 604, 623 P.2d 165] (<i>Graham</i>).)</p>
<p id="037c8689-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One “established rule” is that a court need not enforce an adhesion contract that is unconscionable. (<i>Graham</i>, supra, 28 Cal. 3d at p. 820.) As our Supreme Court explained in <i>Armendariz</i>, the Legislature has now codified the principle, historically developed in case law, that a court may refuse to enforce an unconscionable provision in a contract. (Civ. Code, §1670.5.)<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11158_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N11158_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">8</a></span> . . . </p>
<p id="037cad9b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unconscionability has both a procedural and a substantive element, the former focusing on “oppression” or “surprise” due to unequal bargaining power, the latter on “overly harsh” or “one-sided” results. (<i>Armendariz</i>, supra, 24 Cal. 4th at p. 114.) “‘The prevailing view is that [procedural and substantive unconscionability] must <i>both</i> be present in order for a court to exercise its discretion to refuse to enforce a contract or clause under the doctrine of unconscionability.’ [Citation.] But they need not be present in the same degree. . . . [T]he more substantively oppressive the contract term, the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable, and vice versa.” (<i>Ibid</i>.)</p>
<p id="037cad9c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the FAA, a court may not consider a claim that an arbitration provision is unenforceable if it is a subterfuge for a challenge that the entire agreement (in which the arbitration clause is only a part) is unconscionable. That contention must be presented to the arbitrator. . . . Our task, therefore, is two-fold: (1) Does the petition here challenge the enforceability of the Agreement and the Release, in toto, or does it contest only the arbitration provision? (2) If it is the latter, is the arbitration provision unconscionable?</p>

<p id="037cad9f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>C. The Trial Court Incorrectly Concluded Petitioners were Challenging the Enforceability of the Entire Agreement and Release</b></p>
<p id="037cada0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court offered two reasons for its decision to order arbitration. First, it concluded that petitioners’ opposition to arbitration was predicated on a challenge to the Agreement as a whole, not to the arbitration provision in particular. From this premise, the trial court reasoned that, because the enforceability of the entire agreement is to be considered by the arbitrator, not the court . . . , the petition should be granted. The trial court’s framing of the issue was seen in its written ruling, where it stated, “Although plaintiffs argue that the ‘arbitration agreements’ are enforceable, their argument is directed not at the arbitration provisions but at the releases themselves.” . . . </p>
<p id="037cada1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although we agree with the court’s legal analysis, its ultimate conclusion was flawed because petitioners’ opposition to the petition was that the arbitration clause in particular, not the entire Agreement, was unconscionable. Petitioners devoted considerable attention to paragraph 69 of the Agreement, emphasizing that it “is not set out or made distinguishable in any manner. It is misidentified within the caption as ‘miscellaneous.’ It is not distinguished in different type font size, bold letters, capital letters, in red, and does not contain any separate waiver notice.” The caption of a four-page argument made by petitioners reads: “The Arbitration Agreements Are Procedurally and Substantively Unconscionable Thereby Barring Their Enforcement.” And in arguing that the arbitration provision was substantively unconscionable, petitioners quoted from paragraph 69 in an effort to demonstrate that the provision was one-sided, requiring only them, and not the television defendants, to submit to arbitration. The principal thrust of petitioners’ oral argument to the trial court was likewise that “the entire arbitration clause was itself one-sided. So only the plaintiffs under that clause have a duty to arbitrate.”</p>
<p id="037cada2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . .</p>
<p id="037cada3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second justification offered by the trial court for granting the television defendants’ petition to compel arbitration was that petitioners had an opportunity to read the Agreement and Release before signing them. While this is factually correct and legally bears on whether the Agreement is procedurally unconscionable, no authority is cited for a supposed rule that if a party reads an agreement he or she is barred from claiming it is unconscionable. Such a rule would seriously undermine the unconscionability defense.</p>
<p id="037cada4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given the limited scope of the trial court’s ruling, we could remand to permit it to decide whether the arbitration provision is unconscionable. Instead, because the case is before us on uncontested facts and our review is de novo, we decide the legal issues in the first instance. . . . </p>

<p id="037cada6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b><i>1. The Adhesive Nature of the Parties’ Agreement</i></b></p>
<p id="037cd4b7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We begin with whether the parties’ agreement was adhesive. (See <i>Armendariz</i>, supra, 24 Cal. 4th at p. 113.) As discussed above, “ ‘[t]he term [contract of adhesion] signifies a standardized contract, which, imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength, relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.’ ” (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>
<p id="037cd4b8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, it is undisputed that the lengthy Agreement was drafted by the television defendants. It is a standardized contract; none of the petitioners’ names or other identifying information is included in the body of the document. There is no serious doubt that the television defendants had far more bargaining power than petitioners.</p>
<p id="037cd4b9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The remaining question is whether petitioners were relegated only to signing or rejecting the Agreement. The television defendants note that there is no evidence petitioners were told they could not negotiate any terms of the Agreement or that petitioners made any attempt to do so. Although literally correct, the uncontested evidence was that on the day petitioners signed the Agreement the television defendants initially met with the Leomitis alone. Inferentially, at the television defendants’ urging, immediately after the meeting concluded, the Leomitis gave the Agreement and exhibits to petitioners with directions to “flip through the pages and sign.” The documents were returned in five to ten minutes. One of the producers testified that he told the Leomitis “that these agreements must be executed as a condition to their further participation in the program.”</p>
<p id="037cd4ba-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From these facts, we conclude the Agreement was presented to petitioners on a take-it-or-leave-it basis by the party with the superior bargaining position who was not willing to engage in negotiations. Accordingly, we conclude the Agreement and exhibits constitute a contract of adhesion.</p>
<p id="037cd4bb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b><i>2. Procedural Unconscionability</i></b></p>
<p id="037cd4bc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Procedural unconscionability focuses on the factors of surprise and oppression [citations], with surprise being a function of the disappointed reasonable expectations of the weaker party.” (Harper v. Ultimo, [(2003) 113 Cal. App. 4th 1402, 1406, 7 Cal. Rptr. 3d 418.])</p>
<p id="037cd4bd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, the arbitration provision appears in one paragraph near the end of a lengthy, single-spaced document. The entire agreement was drafted by the television defendants, who transmitted copies of it to the petitioners. The television defendants knew petitioners were young and unsophisticated, and had recently lost both parents. Indeed, it was petitioners’ vulnerability that made them so attractive to the television defendants. The latter made no effort to highlight the presence of the arbitration provision in the Agreement. It was one of 12 numbered paragraphs in a section entitled “MISCELLANEOUS.” In contrast to several other paragraphs, no text in the arbitration provision is highlighted. No words are printed in bold letters or larger font; nor are they <span title="658" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-658">p. 658</span>capitalized. Although petitioners were required to place their initials in boxes adjacent to six other paragraphs, no box appeared next to the arbitration provision.</p>

The clause repeatedly includes “I agree” language, with the “I” being a reference to the “applicant” (i.e., each of the petitioners). The only time the phrase “the parties” is used is in the last sentence, where “the parties” agree that, notwithstanding the arbitration provision, the producer has the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of law as provided for in Code of Civil Procedure §1281.1 or other relevant laws.</p>

Thus, “all disputes” are subject to arbitration, and either side may move to compel.

A California trial court found that plaintiffs were unable to demonstrate that promises were made to them by the defendants that they would ultimately have ownership interests in the house built for the Leomitis, and that although some portions of their contracts with defendants were perhaps unconscionable, these were relatively minor, and severable. An appellate court affirmed summary judgment for the television defendants. Higgins v. Disney/ABC Int’l Television, Inc., 2009 WL 692701 (Cal. Ct. App.).

<li class=""><p id="037d22ef-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>“Adhesion contracts” and procedural unconscionability.</i> The <i>Higgins</i> court begins its discussion of procedural unconscionability by noting that the agreement and release are adhesive, as defined by the court. Recall the discussion of adhesion contracts in the notes after the <i>C &amp; J Fertilizer</i> case in Chapter 5. Although the <i>Higgins</i> court does not do so, a number of California decisions have held that the fact that a contract is adhesive is enough of itself to render a contract procedurally unconscionable. See, e.g., Grand Prospect Partners, L.P. v. Ross Dress for Less, Inc., 182 Cal. Rptr. 3d 235, 248 (Ct. App. 2015) (procedural aspect of unconscionability can be established either by showing that contract was one of adhesion or by totality of the circumstances). Other California decisions, as well as those from other jurisdictions, have held that something more must be shown before an adhesion contract can be found to be procedurally unconscionable. See, e.g., Morris v. Redwood Empire Bancorp, 27 Cal. Rptr. 3d 797, 807-808 (Ct. App. 2005) (noting that some California decisions seem to “reflexively” find adhesion contracts procedurally unconscionable but holding that there must also be a showing of a lack of market alternatives or a showing of “surprise”). The California Supreme Court has more recently stated that the fact that a contract is adhesive calls for close examination of possible substantive unconscionability, but even more scrutiny is warranted when elements of surprise or sharp practices are present. Baltazar v. Forever 21, Inc., 367 P.3d 6, 12 (Cal. 2016).</p>
<p id="037d22f0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Higgins</i> court did highlight some aspects of the transaction, beyond the adhesive nature of the contract, to support its finding of procedural unconscionability. The court noted that the arbitration provision was placed inconspicuously within the writing, that the plaintiffs were urged to quickly sign the document, and that the plaintiffs were young, recently orphaned, and lacking business sophistication. Other cases have focused on similar factors in assessing procedural unconscionability. See, e.g., Beltran v. InterExchange, Inc., 2017 WL 4418711 (D. Colo.) (in addition to being adhesive, arbitration agreement between plaintiff au pairs and placement business held procedurally unconscionable based on facts that plaintiffs were youthful, spoke English as second language, and lacked business experience, and terms were “buried” at end of lengthy contract); Carmona v. Lincoln Millennium Car Wash, Inc., 171 Cal.Rptr. 3d 42 (Ct. App. 2014) (in addition to contract being adhesive, surprise element of procedural unconscionability established by failure of employer to provide Spanish translation of key provisions to plaintiffs who could not read English).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="037d22f1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Arbitration agreements and substantive unconscionability.</i> Following the nearly unanimous view on the question, the appellate court holds that the arbitration agreement must also have an element of substantive unconscionability in order to be rendered unenforceable. Both the trial court and the appellate court agreed that the arbitral costs would be prohibitive for the Higgins family. Many other courts have recognized that the arbitration agreement may be substantively unconscionable if excessive costs of arbitration effectively preclude the claimant from pursing relief. See Adkins v. Labor Ready, Inc., 303 F.3d 496, 502 (4th Cir. 2002). Another possible basis for substantive unconscionability <span title="661" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-661">p. 661</span>identified by the <i>Higgins</i> court is the lack of “bilateral” application of the arbitration agreement. The California Supreme Court in the cited <i>Armendariz</i> case concluded that mandatory arbitration agreements must have a “modicum of bilaterality” to avoid substantive unconscionability. The court stated that if the arbitration system is indeed fair, then the party drafting the arbitration agreement should also be willing to submit claims to arbitration. Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc., 6 P.3d 669, 691-692 (Cal. 2000).</p>
<p id="037d22f2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One should not overestimate, however, the likelihood of avoiding enforcement of an arbitration agreement based on alleged unconscionability. As explained in more detail in the Comment below, the U.S. Supreme Court has led the way in narrowing the grounds on which an arbitration agreement may be invalidated. Federal and state court decisions denying relief from arbitration are plentiful. In Muriithi v. Shuttle Express, Inc., 712 F.3d 173 (4th Cir. 2013), for example, the Fourth Circuit reversed a district court’s decision and rejected substantive unconscionability arguments based on the agreement, including a class action ban, a one-year limitations period for filing a claim, and an arbitration fee-splitting provision, absent a showing with “firm evidence” that the arbitral costs would likely be prohibitive for the plaintiff. Similarly, the California Supreme Court, in a notable decision, disagreed with the trial court and held that an employment arbitration agreement was enforceable, though adhesive in nature, rejecting the employee’s argument that there was substantive unconscionability due to unequal ability of the parties to seek relief outside of arbitration. Baltazar v. Forever 21, Inc., 367 P.3d 6 (Cal. 2016).</p></li>

The ubiquitous spread of mandatory arbitration agreements is not unique to California. See generally Charles L. Knapp, Taking Contracts Private: The Quiet Revolution in Contract Law, 71 Fordham L. Rev. 761, 796, nn. 118-119 (2002) (listing cases, many involving consumers, in which arbitration agreements were found unconscionable by state or federal courts).</p>
<p id="037d22f4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In an article criticizing the widespread use of arbitration agreements in consumer contracts, Professor Richard M. Alderman summarized his findings:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="037d22f5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From a philosophical perspective, it is difficult to find fault with the concept of ADR, specifically the use of arbitration as an alternative to litigation in consumer cases. No one can oppose a system of dispute resolution that is less expensive, more efficient, and more flexible. At first glance, arbitration of consumer disputes would appear to offer substantial benefits over formal litigation. Because the rules of arbitration are less formal, and arbitrators have more freedom to “do the right thing,” it should be more likely consumers would fare better in arbitration than before a judge, where they are bound by more formal rules and are subject to appellate review. Additionally, the speed and reduced cost of arbitration should provide prompt resolution. Consumers, if given the choice, would surely favor arbitration over litigation.</p>
<p id="037d22f6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Upon further review, however, the realities of pre-dispute mandatory arbitration, as currently employed in American consumer transactions, differ sharply <span title="662" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-662">p. 662</span>from the idealized process described above. First, the consumer rarely, if ever, chooses arbitration; pre-dispute arbitration is imposed upon the consumer by a contract of adhesion in which the consumer has no real choice. Second, arbitration often is not as prompt or as inexpensive as alternative courts, especially small claims courts. Third, the informal rules, lack of guidelines, and finality of the decision often favor the business organization, due in large part to its significant role as a “repeat-player.” Finally, and perhaps most importantly, imposition of mandatory arbitration generally precludes the consumer’s freedom to choose to litigate in a class action and eliminates any favorable precedent or law reform that could arise through litigation.</p>

<p id="037d22f9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the early twentieth century, American courts were often hostile to the notion that parties could by contract bind themselves to submit future disputes to private arbitration, rather than resolving them through litigation in the public courts. Judges saw such arrangements as improper encroachments on judicial power, and often declined to enforce contractual arbitration clauses. But contracting parties, particularly commercial enterprises, were increasingly drawn to arbitration as a mechanism for dispute resolution, for a combination of reasons: Arbitration was seen as faster, less expensive, and more private than the public litigation system. In addition, arbitrators selected by the parties were potentially better able to grasp the commercial realities of the business world than judges with possibly little or no real-world experience in commercial affairs. Arbitrators were also generally freer than courts to reach a commercially reasonable resolution of a business dispute without being bound by rigid and possibly “unrealistic” rules of law. Eventually, at both the state and federal levels, American legislatures adopted Arbitration Acts: laws requiring courts to respect and enforce contractual provisions by which parties bound themselves to arbitrate disputes that might in the future arise between them. See Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. §§1-16. Such agreements for “mandatory” (or “compulsory”) arbitration — so called because they were designed to be binding even against a party that might in the meantime have changed its mind about using the arbitration process — could thereafter no longer be ignored or overridden by courts on the ground that they somehow usurped the courts’ prerogatives.</p>
<p id="037d22fa-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By the latter part of the twentieth century, the tables had rather completely turned. American courts, led by the U.S. Supreme Court, interpreted and applied the FAA so vigorously that lower courts and state legislatures found it difficult or impossible to impose any sort of regulatory procedures or decisional process that might in any way prevent disputes from being shunted out of the court system and into arbitration whenever a contract so provided, <span title="663" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-663">p. 663</span>even if that contract was a contract of adhesion or otherwise of dubious validity. See generally Jeffrey W. Stempel, Bootstrapping and Slouching Toward Gomorrah: Arbitral Infatuation and the Decline of Consent, 62 Brook. L. Rev. 1335 (1996). And where the enthusiasm for arbitration clauses had earlier been mostly confined to contracts between commercial enterprises, large-scale businesses began to insert them into contracts with their customers on a massive scale. Banks, credit-card lenders, telecommunications companies, sellers of goods, insurance companies, even health-care providers, turned to mandatory arbitration, as did employers. David S. Schwartz, Enforcing Small Print to Protect Big Business: Employee and Consumer Rights Claims in an Age of Compelled Arbitration, 1997 Wis. L. Rev. 33. Proponents of this development saw in consumer arbitration the same virtues that an earlier generation had seen in its use in commercial disputes. Consumer advocates, however, argued that by drafting their contracts so as to require arbitration of future disputes, business enterprises with the economic power to impose terms on their customers or employees could obtain a variety of practical advantages, and could even use arbitration provisions to effectively deprive consumers and employees of any means of dispute resolution.</p>
<p id="037d22fb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite its breadth of application, the FAA does have some limitations on its scope: It expressly provides that a written agreement to arbitrate “shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.” FAA, 9 U.S.C. §2. Unable to challenge directly the Supreme Court’s insistence on a strong preference for arbitration, parties desiring to avoid being forced to submit to arbitration increasingly mounted unconscionability attacks on arbitration clauses, and with mounting success.</p>
<p id="037d22fc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a result of these developments, the number of court decisions in which the unconscionability doctrine was applied increased substantially after 1990. Results of a recent study indicated that the number of unconscionability decisions grew rather dramatically over the period between 1990 and 2010, with much (but not all) of that increase being attributable to disputes over contractual provisions calling for mandatory arbitration. Charles L. Knapp, Blowing the Whistle on Mandatory Arbitration: Unconscionability as a Signaling Device, 46 San Diego L. Rev. 609, 619-626 (2009).</p>
<p id="037d4a0d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, the Supreme Court has continued to be highly resistant to any claims that arbitration clauses are unenforceable. See Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson, 561 U.S. 63 (2010) (arbitration clause could effectively delegate to arbitrator the power to decide whether the arbitration clause was unconscionable); American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Rest., 133 S. Ct. 2304 (2013) (class action waiver in arbitration provision was enforceable even if cost of individually arbitrating individual claims exceeded potential recovery). In the absence of change in the Supreme Court or legislative action by Congress, both of which seem highly unlikely, the prospects for use of the doctrine of unconscionability to invalidate arbitration clauses appear to be dismal.

<p id="037d4a14-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 2006, at the height of the housing market, Philip McFarland was informed by a mortgage broker that his home’s value had nearly doubled in two years. Acting on that advice, McFarland refinanced his home so that he could pay down other debt. But it soon became apparent that McFarland could not manage the increased interest payments on his new loan, and when housing prices fell, McFarland was faced with an unaffordable mortgage and a looming foreclosure.</p>
<p id="037d4a15-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">McFarland sued, alleging that his mortgage agreement, providing him with a loan far in excess of his home’s actual value, was an “unconscionable contract” under the West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act, W.Va. Code § 46A–1–101, <i>et seq.</i> (the “Act” or the “WVCCPA”). The district court rejected that claim, holding that a loan exceeding the worth of a home, without more, is not evidence of “substantive unconscionability” under West Virginia law. And because the district court understood a WVCCPA claim always to require a showing of substantive unconscionability, it stopped its analysis there, without considering the fairness of the process by which the agreement was reached.</p>
<p id="037d4a16-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree with the district court that the amount of a mortgage loan, by itself, cannot show substantive unconscionability under West Virginia law, and that McFarland has not otherwise made that showing. But we disagree as to the proper interpretation of the WVCCPA, and find that the Act allows for claims of “unconscionable inducement” even when the substantive terms of a contract are not themselves unfair. Accordingly, we remand so that the district court may consider in the first instance whether McFarland’s mortgage agreement was induced by unconscionable conduct.</p>

<p id="037d4a19-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 2004, McFarland purchased his Hedgesville, West Virginia home for roughly $110,000. Just two years later, in June 2006, he availed himself of then-favorable debt markets to engage in the refinancing that is the subject of this appeal. Interested in consolidating his approximately $40,000 in combined student and vehicle debt with his mortgage, McFarland entered into discussions with Greentree Mortgage Corporation (“Greentree”), a third-party mortgage lender. Greentree arranged for an appraisal of McFarland’s property, and McFarland was informed that the market value of his home had jumped to $202,000 since its acquisition two years earlier.</p>
<p id="037d4a1a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">McFarland then entered into two secured loan agreements. The first, which is the subject of this dispute, was a mortgage agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, <span title="665" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-665">p. 665</span>N.A. (“Wells Fargo”), with a principal amount of $181,800 and an adjustable interest rate that started at 7.75 percent and could increase to 13.75 percent (the “Wells Fargo Loan”). The second, not directly at issue here, was with Greentree, for an interest-only home equity line of credit of $20,000. As planned, McFarland used the proceeds of those two loans to consolidate all of his debts.</p>
<p id="037d4a1b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">McFarland paid the Wells Fargo Loan without incident for roughly a year. In late 2007, however, he began to fall behind on his mortgage payments, and contacted Wells Fargo to ask for assistance. After several failed attempts to restructure McFarland’s mortgage, Wells Fargo and McFarland entered into a loan modification in May 2010. The revised agreement reduced McFarland’s interest rate and extended the term of the loan in exchange for an increase in the principal amount outstanding. But even under the new arrangement, McFarland remained unable to make his payments. In 2012, Wells Fargo initiated foreclosure on McFarland’s home.</p>

Code § 46A–2–121(1)(a).</p>
<p id="037d4a1f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">McFarland raised two distinct “unconscionable contract” arguments in his complaint and before the district court, either of which, he contended, could support an unconscionability finding under the WVCCPA. The first was a traditional unconscionability claim with its genesis in the common law, focusing on the terms of the Wells Fargo Loan itself and, in particular, the size of the mortgage it provided. Put simply, McFarland argued that Wells Fargo loaned him too much money. Citing a 2012 retroactive appraisal finding that his home was worth only $120,000 in June 2006—considerably less than the $202,000 valuation that preceded the Wells Fargo Loan—McFarland claimed that Wells Fargo’s excess loan tied him to an unaffordable mortgage that increased his housing burden by several hundred dollars a month and put his home at risk. That general species of unconscionability claim (if not this particular variant), alleging the unfairness of the terms of an agreement, is well established in West Virginia: In the context of consumer agreements, it is now codified under the WVCCPA, <i>see</i> W.Va. Code § 46A–2–121(1)(a) (court may refuse to enforce a consumer agreement that is “unconscionable at the time it was made”), and it has long roots in West Virginia’s common law, <i>see</i> Brown v. Genesis Healthcare Corp., 229 W.Va. 382, 729 S.E.2d 217, 226–27 (2012).</p>
<p id="037d4a20-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">McFarland’s second theory of unconscionability was more novel. West Virginia’s traditional unconscionability doctrine, as is customary, requires <span title="666" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-666">p. 666</span>a showing of both substantive unconscionability, or unfairness in the contract itself, and procedural unconscionability, or unfairness in the bargaining process. . . . But McFarland’s alternative argument was that even if the Wells Fargo Loan was not unconscionable when made, the district court could invalidate it on the independent ground that it was “unconscionably induced”—in other words, based solely on factors predating acceptance of the contract and relating to the bargaining process. Specifically, McFarland argued that the Wells Fargo Loan was “induced by misrepresentations,” focusing on what he alleged to be the vastly inflated appraisal of his home in 2006. And according to McFarland, that kind of unconscionable inducement is, under the text of the WVCCPA, grounds for relief by itself, without regard to the loan agreement’s substantive terms. <i>See</i> W.Va. Code § 46A–2–121(1)(a) (court may refuse to enforce a consumer agreement that is “unconscionable at the time it was made, or . . . induced by unconscionable conduct [such as affirmative misrepresentations, active deceit or concealment of a material fact]”).</p>
<p id="037d4a21-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After McFarland filed his complaint, he and the defendants engaged in several months of extensive discovery. McFarland eventually reached a settlement with Greentree, but his case against Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank (“the Banks”) proceeded. In the decision that is the subject of this appeal, the district court granted the Banks’ motion for summary judgment and dismissed McFarland’s unconscionable contract claim. <i>McFarland v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.,</i> 19 F. Supp. 3d 663, 668–73 (S.D.W.Va. 2014).</p>
<p id="037d7132-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As to substantive unconscionability, the district court explained that McFarland had identified two allegedly unconscionable features of the Wells Fargo Loan in both his complaint and his opposition to the Banks’ motion for summary judgment: that the loan far exceeded the value of the property, and that the loan provided no “net tangible benefit” to McFarland. But neither, the district court held, provided a basis for a finding of substantive unconscionability.</p>
<p id="037d7133-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That a refinanced loan exceeds the value of a home, the court ruled, is not evidence of substantive unconscionability under West Virginia law. “It is not ‘overly harsh’ or ‘one-sided’ against the plaintiff that he received <i>more</i> financing than he was allegedly entitled to receive.” <i>McFarland,</i> 19 F. Supp. 3d at 670 (emphasis in original). If anything, the court reasoned, an under-secured mortgage disadvantages the lender, not the borrower. Absent unfairness in specific loan terms like the rate of interest charged or the timing of payments, the court concluded, there is nothing substantively unconscionable about a loan simply because of its size.</p>
<p id="037d7134-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor does West Virginia law require that a contract provide a “net tangible benefit” to either party, the court held. Under West Virginia law, a contract is substantively unconscionable only if it is “one-sided,” with an “overly harsh effect on the disadvantaged party.” <i>Id.</i> at 673 . . . That is a different standard, the court reasoned, and whether the Wells Fargo Loan was of net benefit to McFarland is simply not relevant to the substantive unconscionability inquiry.</p>
<p id="037d7135-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the district court held that in light of its holding as to substantive unconscionability, there was no need even to consider McFarland’s allegations regarding the process that led to contract formation.

As a result, the court dismissed McFarland’s claim—including his allegation of “unconscionable inducement” under the WVCCPA—without further addressing the purported misrepresentations that led to the Wells Fargo Loan.</p>

<p id="037d713e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fortunately, the West Virginia courts have made very clear the standard for substantive unconscionability under state law: A contract term is substantively unconscionable only if it is both “one-sided” and “overly harsh” as to the disadvantaged party. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Dan Ryan Builders, Inc. v. Nelson, 230 W.Va. 281, 737 S.E.2d 550, 558 (2012); . . . . The point is not to disturb the “reasonable allocation of risks or reasonable advantage because of superior bargaining power.” Arnold v. United Cos. Lending Corp., 204 W.Va. 229, 511 S.E.2d 854, <span title="668" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-668">p. 668</span>860 (1998) (quoting Unif. Consumer Credit Code 1974 § 5.108 cmt. 3), <i>overruled on other grounds by Dan Ryan Builders,</i> 230 W.Va. 281, 737 S.E.2d 550. Rather, substantive unconscionability screens for cases in which a “gross imbalance, one-sidedness or lop-sidedness in a contract” will justify a court’s refusal to enforce the agreement as written. <i>Genesis Healthcare,</i> 729 S.E.2d at 220.</p>
<p id="037d713f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree with the district court that under this standard, a mortgage agreement would not be deemed substantively unconscionable solely because it provides a borrower with more money than his home is worth. Whatever the pitfalls, receiving too much money from a bank is not what is generally meant by “overly harsh” treatment, and we have no reason to think that the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals would apply its standard in such a counterintuitive manner. As the district court noted, it is not the borrower but the bank that typically is disadvantaged by an under-collateralized loan. That is why borrowers may pay a premium for under- or non-collateralized loans . . .; why it is common practice for banks, as many borrowers can attest, to ensure that their real estate loans are for significantly less than property value . . .; and why a generous mortgage loan is usually cause for celebration and not a lawsuit.</p>
<p id="037d7140-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">McFarland, with the support of multiple amici,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1139A_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1139A_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">3</a></span> rejects that common-sense application of West Virginia’s substantive unconscionability law, arguing that it fails to take account of the broader social and economic context. According to McFarland, the Wells Fargo Loan is but one example of a widespread practice of overvaluing homes and lending too much money that has contributed to a national home foreclosure crisis: When a borrower is bound to a mortgage that exceeds the value of his home, he is trapped, unable to refinance to obtain better terms or sell his home to relocate, and foreclosure is the result. It is that harm to borrowers and to public policy, McFarland argues, that renders mortgage loans in excess of home value substantively unconscionable under West Virginia law.</p>
<p id="037d9752-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We certainly agree that consumers may be harmed, sometimes grievously, when they take on more mortgage debt than their homes are worth. . . . And we have no reason to doubt that West Virginia’s courts would acknowledge that disproportionate debt may be dangerous both for homeowners and for the broader economy. . . . Indeed, we note that West Virginia already has decided to regulate by statute precisely the lending practices of which McFarland complains, with a law aimed squarely at predatory mortgage lending. <i>See</i> W.Va. Code § 31–17–8(m)(8) (prohibiting “a primary or subordinate mortgage loan in a principal amount that . . . exceeds the fair market value of the property”).</p>
<p id="037d9753-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But here is where we disagree with McFarland: The fact that a practice is harmful does not by itself make it substantively unconscionable as a matter of West Virginia contract law. Rather, as noted above, substantive unconscionability is an equitable doctrine reserved for those cases in which a contract is “so one-sided that it has an overly harsh effect on the disadvantaged party.” <i>Dan <span title="669" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-669">p. 669</span>Ryan Builders,</i> 737 S.E.2d at 558. And an under-collateralized loan, though it ultimately may cause harm, cannot meet this standard, because it will benefit the borrower in at least some respects and operate to the detriment of the lender in others. Here, for example, the Wells Fargo Loan provided McFarland with the money he needed to pay off approximately $40,000 of student and automobile debt, as he had hoped. And while it undoubtedly exposed McFarland to certain risks, it posed risks for the bank, as well: When a bank writes a mortgage for more money than a borrower’s home is worth, it takes the chance that it will forfeit at least some of its capital in the event of a default.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN113B4_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N113B4_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">4</a></span> So a loan in excess of home value does not accrue entirely to the lender’s benefit, and thus lacks the kind of “gross imbalance, one-sidedness or lopsidedness,” <i>id.,</i> and evident impropriety that West Virginia courts have identified in setting aside contract terms as substantively unconscionable. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 559–60 (striking down unilateral arbitration clause because it was wholly one-sided and unfair); . . . . </p>
<p id="037d9755-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our belief that the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals would not recognize loan size, by itself, as evidence of substantive unconscionability is confirmed when we consider the problems that would arise in fashioning a remedy in such circumstances. In the typical case, when what is challenged is a particular contract term—say, a rate of interest, or a prepayment penalty—courts may sever the unconscionable term or reform it to avoid an “unconscionable result.” <i>See</i> W.Va. Code § 46A–2–121(1)(b). But here, the only way to avoid what McFarland alleges is the unconscionable feature of having been loaned too much money would be to cancel the loan agreement altogether—which would spare McFarland a foreclosure but also require that he return the loan principal to Wells Fargo, which is of course the very outcome he seeks to avoid. <i>See Quicken Loans, Inc. v. Brown,</i> 236 W.Va. 12, 777 S.E.2d 581, 592 (2014) (“<i>Quicken Loans II</i>”) (requiring return of loan principal as part of remedy for unconscionable loan agreement). The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals has been clear that “cancellation of the debt”—relieving McFarland of the obligation to repay his Wells Fargo Loan altogether—“is not a permissible remedy” in circumstances like these. <i>See Quicken Loans II,</i> 777 S.E.2d at 591. And with that off the table and no good alternative proposed, we think it unlikely that the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals would reach out to create a new variant of substantive unconscionability for which there appears to be no sensible remedy. <i>Cf.</i> Mallet v. Pickens, 206 W.Va. 145, 522 S.E.2d 436, 441 n.6 (1999) (interpreting West Virginia common law to avoid an “illogical, counterintuitive outcome”).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN113D5_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N113D5_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">5</a></span></p>

<p id="037d9759-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">McFarland appears to have borrowed the “net tangible benefit” test he proposes from West Virginia’s anti-predatory lending statute, which prohibits mortgage brokers from charging certain fees “unless the new loan has a reasonable, tangible net benefit to the borrower considering all of the circumstances.” <i>See</i> W.Va. Code § 31–17–8(d). But McFarland has not alleged that the Wells Fargo Loan violated this provision, nor pointed to any West Virginia case law borrowing its language and applying it in the very different context of a § 46A–2–121 “unconscionable contract” claim.

<p id="037dbe73-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We reach a different conclusion with respect to McFarland’s claim of unconscionable inducement. Though the question is not fully settled under West Virginia law, we believe the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals would rule that the WVCCPA authorizes a stand-alone claim for unconscionable inducement, predicated on the process leading up to contract formation and independent of any showing of substantive unconscionability.</p>
<p id="037dbe74-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The terms of the WVCCPA are plain enough: Section 46A–2-121 authorizes a court to refuse enforcement of an agreement on one of two distinct findings: that the agreement was “unconscionable at the time it was made, <i>or</i> [that it was] induced by unconscionable conduct.” W.Va. Code § 46A–2–121(1)(a) (emphasis added). What makes the question interesting is the interplay between West Virginia’s unconscionability common law and the codification of an unconscionability provision in the WVCCPA. . . . [T]he question is whether the second part of § 46A–2121(1)(a), covering contracts “induced by unconscionable conduct,” is to be read as diverging from this traditional understanding and authorizing a claim for unconscionable inducement that does not require a showing of substantive unconscionability. . . . </p>
<p id="037dbe75-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For several reasons, we think the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals would answer this question in the affirmative. First, it has come very close to doing so already. In its 2012 decision in <i>Quicken Loans I,</i> the court sustained <span title="672" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-672">p. 672</span>findings of “unconscionability in the inducement” based entirely on conduct predating acceptance of the contract and allegations going to the fairness of the process, without regard to substantive unconscionability: a “false promise” of refinancing, the sudden introduction of a balloon payment at closing, a negligently conducted appraisal review, and other similar factors. 737 S.E.2d at 657–58. Because the court’s analysis of unconscionable inducement was only one portion of its overall unconscionability analysis—which also reflected that the loan agreement included several substantively unconscionable terms, <i>id.</i> at 658—we will err on the side of caution and treat it as something less than a clear holding on the question. But at a minimum, it is a strong indication that the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals understands the WVCCPA to allow for unconscionable inducement claims separate and apart from substantive unconscionability.</p>
<p id="037dbe76-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals takes a plain meaning approach to statutory construction. . . . And the language of the WVCCPA fits the bill. It expressly authorizes courts to refuse to enforce an agreement that they find “to have been unconscionable at the time it was made, <i>or to have been induced by unconscionable conduct.</i>” W.Va. Code § 46A–2–121(1)(a) (emphasis added). The word “or” unmistakably signals two distinct causes of action when it comes to consumer loans: one for unconscionability in the loan terms themselves, and one for unconscionable conduct that causes a party to enter into a loan. If the legislature had intended to require both substantive and process-related unconscionability, subjecting creditors to liability only where an agreement itself is unconscionable, then all it had to do was replace the “or” with an “and.” . . . </p>
<p id="037dbe77-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the West Virginia courts have advised that the comments to the Uniform Consumer Credit Code (“UCCC”) are “highly instructive” when it comes to construing § 46A–2–121 because its unconscionability provisions are “identical” to those of the statute. <i>Quicken Loans I,</i> 737 S.E.2d at 656–57. And the comments to the UCCC not only indicate that a stand–alone unconscionable inducement claim exists, but also explain its purpose:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="037dbe78-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subsection (1), as does UCC Section 2–302, provides that a court can refuse to enforce or can adjust an agreement or part of an agreement that was unconscionable on its face at the time it was made. However, many agreements are not in and of themselves unconscionable according to their terms, but they would never have been entered into by a consumer if unconscionable means had not been employed to induce the consumer to agree to the contract. It would be a frustration of the policy against unconscionable contracts for a creditor to be able to utilize unconscionable acts or practices to obtain an agreement. Consequently subsection (1) also gives to the court the power to refuse to enforce an agreement if it finds as a matter of law that it was induced by unconscionable conduct.</p>

<p id="037de58a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reading § 46A–2–121(1)(a) to allow for a stand-alone unconscionable inducement claim, we should note, is in no way inconsistent with West Virginia <span title="673" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-673">p. 673</span>precedent holding that procedural unconscionability alone cannot show that a contract was itself unconscionable when made. The kind of procedural unconscionability that is required (in combination with substantive unconscionability) to render a contract or contract term unconscionable in and of itself may turn on such “status” factors as the “relative positions of the parties, the adequacy of the bargaining position, [and] the meaningful alternatives available to the plaintiff.” <i>Quicken Loans I,</i> 737 S.E.2d at 657. We of course leave to West Virginia law the precise contours of an unconscionable inducement claim, but it appears that it will turn not on status considerations that are outside the control of the defendant, but instead on affirmative misrepresentations or active deceit. <i>See id.</i> at 653–55, 657 (unconscionable inducement findings include lender’s concealment of balloon payment and false promise to allow refinancing). As McFarland concedes, in other words, the standard for unconscionable inducement is different and higher than that for procedural unconscionability.</p>
<p id="037de58b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, we hold that the district court erred in dismissing McFarland’s claim of unconscionable inducement on the ground that substantive unconscionability is a necessary predicate of a finding of unconscionability under the WVCCPA. We take no view as to the underlying merits of McFarland’s unconscionable inducement claim, and remand to the district court to consider McFarland’s evidence that his loan agreement was “induced by misrepresentations” and determine whether it allows him to proceed against the Banks.</p>

<li class=""><p id="037de590-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Excessive loan amounts and substantive unconscionability.</i>  The federal trial and appellate courts in the <i>McFarland</i> case both agreed that while there are risks to borrowers from taking loan amounts that exceed the fair market value of the securing real property, the lending of such excessive funds would not result in a substantively unconscionable contract under West Virginia law as they viewed it. Although it appears that the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals has not yet spoken to that precise issue, two justices have cited the <i>McFarland</i> case favorably while strongly asserting that singular, primary loans which exceed the value of the property should not be illegal, may be knowingly taken for good reasons, and are not likely to be deceptive to consumers. See Quicken Loans, Inc. v. Walters for Walters, 801 S.E.2d 509, 523-524 (W.Va. 2017) (Loughery, C.J., and Ketchum, J., dissenting). (The <i>Walters</i> case involved a dispute about the scope of a West Virginia predatory lending statute, W.Va. Code § 31-17-8(m)(8), that was not at issue in <i>McFarland</i>.) Do you agree that extending such excessive loans should not be deemed substantively <span title="674" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-674">p. 674</span>unconscionable? How does this questionable practice compare with the use of the “add-on” collateral clause in <i>Williams v. Walker-Thomas</i> or the arbitration terms in the <i>Higgins</i> case?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="037de591-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Interrelationship between fraud and unconscionability.</i> The <i>McFarland</i> court remanded the case so that the plaintiff could have a chance to pursue a claim that his mortgage agreement was “induced by unconscionable conduct” as defined by the West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act. The statute provides that such a finding would depend on factors “such as affirmative misrepresentations, active deceit or concealment of a material fact.” W.Va. Code § 46A–2–121(1)(a). There is obviously potential for overlap between the statutory claim of “unconscionable inducement” and a common law claim of fraud. Indeed, the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals made exactly such a determination in the <i>Quicken Loans I</i> case cited in footnote 2 of the <i>McFarland</i> opinion. A natural question is whether the doctrine of unconscionability is redundant and unnecessary given the availability of fraud and other common law theories. Several answers can be given. First, the requirements for fraud and unconscionability are different, and it may not be possible to prove fraud even though the contract is grossly unfair. Fraud typically requires proof of intentional or at least reckless conduct (“scienter”) and may be subject to a higher burden of proof. For example, the court in <i>Quicken Loans I</i> states that fraud must be proved by clear and convincing evidence. Quicken Loans, Inc. v. Brown, 737 S.E.2d 640, 653 (W.Va. 2012). Note that in <i>Quicken Loans I</i>, the court found that the loan was unconscionable not only in its inducement but also that the “loan product, in and of itself, is unconscionable.” Id. at 659.</p>
<p id="037de592-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, in some cases the misconduct of a party may not be based on misrepresentation. For example, <i>In re Checking Account Overdraft Litigation</i>, 694 F. Supp. 2d 1302 (S.D. Fla. 2010), multidistrict litigation (MDL) transferred to Florida, plaintiffs sought to recover</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="037de593-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">excessive overdraft fees for charges made to their accounts on debit card transactions. The alleged common nucleus of specific facts pled assert a common practice by Defendants, to enter charges debiting Plaintiffs’ accounts from the “largest to the smallest” thus maximizing the overdraft fee revenue for themselves. In addition to the allegations about posting order, the Complaints set forth a number of other alleged agreements, policies and practices, contended by Plaintiffs to unlawfully damage them. Plaintiffs’ asserted claims rely upon the legal theories of breach of contract and breach of a covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unconscionability, conversion, unjust enrichment, and violation of the consumer protection statutes of various states.</p>
</div>
<p id="037de594-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">694 F. Supp. 2d at 1307. Claims of fraud are notably absent from the allegations. The court in that case found that the plaintiffs had stated a cause of action for unconscionability.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="037e0ca5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mortgage Loans <i>and the Great Recession.</i> As indicated by the court in footnote 1, Wells Fargo sold the McFarland loan as part of a securitized trust package. The trusts were assembled by Wall Street investment banks and sold to large corporate investors. The case gives an example of the lending practices <span title="675" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-675">p. 675</span>that created inflated mortgage debt, leading to the Great Recession that began in 2008. See Andrew Ross Sorkin, Too Big to Fail (2009) and the movie of the same name (2011). See also Michael Lewis, <i>The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine</i> (2010) and the film <i>The Big Short</i> (2015).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="037e0ca6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>“Payday loans” and unconscionability limits</i>. The plaintiff in <i>McFarland</i> argued that the home loan was unconscionable because the amount of credit extended exceeded the value of his property. A different type of loan involves smaller, short-term, unsecured loans, commonly known as “payday loans,” and allegations that such loans are unconscionable or otherwise unlawful because of exorbitant fees or interest rates. The loans are usually for a few hundred dollars and are targeted toward low-income borrowers. They are typically offered from store-front lenders that have become as numerous as major fast food restaurants. See generally Lowell Ritter, Payday Lending: Friend or Foe?, 20 J. Consumer &amp; Com. L. 146, 147 (2017). Some courts have found such loan agreements unenforceable on statutory and unconscionability grounds. See, e.g., Johnson v. The Cash Store, 68 P.3d 1099 (Wash Ct. App. 2003) (holding that debtor who entered into series of fourteen transactions over seven months could prevail both on unconscionability and statutory violation grounds; plaintiff paid more than $1100 in interest while still owing original loan amount of $500, paying an annual interest rate of more than 600%). The <i>Johnson</i> court observed that the lender’s operations appeared to violate a statutory prohibition of “roll over” loans in which the debtor borrows more money to repay a prior loan and thereby incurs more fees, described as a “debt treadmill.” Id. at 1106. See also Drogorub v. Payday Loan Store of WI, Inc. 826 N.W.2d 123 (Wis. Ct. App. 2012) (finding unconscionable an “auto title loan” in which debtor took $994 to be repaid with $1242 in one month, but after six monthly extensions, debtor had paid $1491 and still owed $1242 for 294% interest rate).</p>
<p id="037e0ca7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A number of states have adopted regulations over the years to govern payday lending and this trend has fostered adaptions by lenders to avoid those limitations. This practice is reflected in De La Torre v. CashCall Inc., 422 P.3d 1004 (Cal. 2018), in which the loan product at issue required a minimum loan amount of $2600, repayable in 42 months at an annualized interest rate of 96% or 135%. The required minimum loan amount avoided California state usury laws, which capped maximum interest rates but only on consumer loans of less than $2500. The statutory framework, however, also made all consumer loans subject to the state law on unconscionability. See Cal. Fin. Code §22302. The lender argued that the absence of a statutory cap on the larger loans meant the <i>interest rates</i> could not be deemed unconscionable. The California Supreme Court rejected that view and held that “[a]n interest rate is the price charged for lending a particular amount of money to a given individual or entity. . . . As with any other price term in an agreement governed by California law, an interest rate may be deemed unconscionable.” 422 P.3d at 1009. Thus, while loans of $2500 or more were not subject to a specific interest rate cap, they were subject to the flexible test of unconscionability, requiring both procedural and substantive elements, taking into account the context and any possible <span title="676" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-676">p. 676</span>justification for the questioned terms. 422 P.3d at 1013-1015. See also James v. National Financial, LLC, 132 A.3d 799 (Del. Ch. 2016) (finding consumer loan agreement unconscionable that provided for a loan of $200 to be repaid in 26, bi-weekly, interest-only payments of $60 followed by a balloon payment of $260 for an interest rate of 838.5%; extreme bargaining imbalance and lack of meaningful choice for debtor also found).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="037e0ca8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Unconscionability as a basis for affirmative relief.</i> Over the years, many courts have construed UCC §2-302 as intended only as a defensive concept, not to be used to gain affirmative relief. This construction is based on the section’s indication that courts may “refuse to enforce” or may “limit the application of” an unconscionable contract or clause. See, e.g., Arthur v. Microsoft Corp., 676 N.W.2d 29, 38-39 (Neb. 2004) (purchasers could not claim damages based on allegation that price versus cost disparity was unconscionable). A few courts have allowed damages or restitution after finding that the contract or one of its clauses was unconscionable. See Langemeier v. National Oats, Inc., 775 F.2d 975, 977-978 (8th Cir. 1985) (section allows court to enforce contract without unconscionable term, which may lead to affirmative relief). In <i>In re Checking Account Overdraft Litigation</i>, cited above in Note 2, the court rejected the argument by the defendant banks that unconscionability could be used only defensively. The banks had allegedly charged the customers’ accounts excessive overdraft fees and retained those funds. The court reasoned that if unconscionability could not be the basis of a cause of action to recover the improper fees, the customers would not have a remedy for the banks’ unconscionable conduct.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="037e0ca9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Unconscionability in commercial cases</i>. Merchants or other commercial parties frequently allege that they are victims of unconscionable bargains, though the courts usually have been disinclined to give relief to those parties. On appropriate facts, however, courts have occasionally found unconscionability in such cases. A leading example is A &amp; M Produce v. FMC Corp., 186 Cal. Rptr. 114 (Ct. App. 1982) in which a contract for sale of faulty agricultural machinery included a warranty disclaimer and an exclusion of consequential damages. The court found procedural unconscionability on two grounds: (1) due to the disparity in size and bargaining power between the buyer, a local though relatively large farming business, and the seller, an international manufacturer; and (2) because the objectionable terms were located on the back side of the contract and were not pointed out by the salesperson. The court also found substantive unconscionability because the clauses shifted to the buyer the risk of lost crops due to failure of the machinery. Id. at 124-126. <i>See also</i> Johnson v. Mobil Oil Co., 415 F. Supp. 264 (E.D. Mich. 1976) (retailer had less than eighth grade education, was practically illiterate, signed the contract with clause excluding consequential damages while busily engaged with service station, and did not discuss any term other than amount of rent). <i>Cf.</i> Harry G. Prince, Unconscionability in California: A Need for Restraint and Consistency, 46 Hastings L. J. 460 (1995) (criticizing <i>A &amp; M Produce</i> and other California decisions finding parties with substantial business experience to be victims of unconscionability, asserting that merchants are more likely to have <span title="677" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-677">p. 677</span>resort to counsel, to read and understand contracts, and to have the ability to find alternative bargains).</p></li>

<p id="037e0cab-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The materials in this chapter examine a variety of judicially developed doctrines for dealing with the problems of coercion in the bargaining process or unfairness of the terms of a bargain. A number of commentators have argued, however, that judicial decision-making in individual cases is not the proper way to deal with such problems. To such critics, the judicial process is an inefficient, often ineffective way of attacking contractual abuses. Moreover, because regulation of such conduct involves important and difficult questions of social policy, legislatures rather than courts are said to be the appropriate institutions to determine the need for and scope of any such regulation. See Robert A. Hillman, Debunking Some Myths about Unconscionability: A New Framework for U.C.C. Section 2-302, 67 Cornell L. Rev. 1, 27-29 (1981); Arthur Allen Leff, Unconscionability and the Crowd — Consumers and the Common Law Tradition, 31 U. Pitt. L. Rev. 349, 356-357 (1970).</p>
<p id="037e0cac-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since the late 1960s, both Congress and the individual state legislatures have enacted a number of consumer protection statutes. In addition, administrative agencies and regulatory officials at both the federal and state levels have been increasingly active in dealing with consumer protection issues. Because such regulation covers a wide range of activities (such as consumer credit, sales practices, and collection activities), an exhaustive review is impossible. This comment will touch on some of the major statutory and administrative efforts in this area.</p>
<p id="037e0cad-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In broad terms, consumer protection legislation has aimed at accomplishing three goals. One of these goals has been to require commercial parties to disclose information to consumers in a meaningful fashion. <i>Disclosure legislation</i> is based on the theory that increased information gives consumers an opportunity to avoid entering into unfair contracts. Such legislation has undoubtedly improved the functioning of the marketplace to some degree. As a means of controlling unfair contracts, however, disclosure legislation has its limitations because abusive contractual provisions may be found in standard form contracts that are rarely read by consumers and are not subject to negotiation. Thus, some consumer protection legislation has a goal of <i>substantive regulation</i> rather than greater disclosure. Under such regulation, particular contractual provisions thought to be unfair are declared unlawful. Finally, since legal changes to protect consumers are meaningful only if enforced, most consumer protection statutes contain provisions designed to <i>improve enforcement.</i></p>
<p id="037e0cae-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1968 Congress enacted the Consumer Credit Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. §1601 et seq., commonly known as the Truth-in-Lending Act. Principally a disclosure statute, the Act requires lenders in consumer credit transactions to disclose by a uniform method the rate of interest on consumer loans (the annual percentage rate or APR) along with various other terms of the loan, such as the scope of any security interest that the creditor would obtain in the debtor’s property. To a limited extent, the Act engages in substantive regulation. <span title="678" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-678">p. 678</span>Consumers are granted a right to rescind within three business days any loan contract that involves a mortgage on the consumer’s principal residence. (First mortgage loans to acquire or construct the consumer’s dwelling are excepted from this right of rescission.) 15 U.S.C. §1635. In an effort to increase creditor compliance, the Act contains a private cause of action for violation of its provisions, including authorization of class actions and the recovery of attorney’s fees. 15 U.S.C. §1640. (Since 1968 the Act has been amended on a number of occasions to include provisions dealing with credit reporting, discrimination in extensions of credit, and collection practices.)</p>
<p id="037e0caf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the same year that Congress passed the Truth-in-Lending Act, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws adopted the Uniform Consumer Credit Code; six years later the Conference issued a revised version of the UCCC. Although the 1968 version of the UCCC contained disclosure provisions similar to those found in the Truth-in-Lending Act, the 1974 version eliminated those provisions on the theory that the federal legislation had as a practical matter preempted the field of disclosure. 7A U.L.A., Prefatory Note at 12 (1999). The principal thrust of the revised UCCC is substantive regulation rather than disclosure. In an effort to protect consumers from exorbitant interest charges, the UCCC sets maximum interest rates for various types of consumer loans. Within the bounds set by these rates, market forces are to determine the cost of credit. In addition, the UCCC prohibits a number of creditor practices, such as assignments of wages and confession of judgment clauses. UCCC §§3.305, 3.306. Interestingly, the UCCC allows (with some modification) the cross-collateral clause that was involved in Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co. UCCC §3.302. See Note 1 following the <i>Williams</i> case. As we have seen, the UCCC also contains a provision outlining factors a court should consider in deciding whether a clause is unconscionable. UCCC §5.108. As of October 2018, eleven states have adopted the UCCC.</p>
<p id="037e0cb0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1975 Congress enacted the Magnuson-Moss Warranty — Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act, 15 U.S.C. §2301 et seq. The portion of the Act dealing with consumer product warranties contains provisions requiring increased disclosure of warranty terms, regulating to some degree the substance of warranty obligations, and improving consumer remedies for breach of warranty. The other portion of the Act grants increased regulatory power to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Created by Congress in 1914, the FTC had been inactive in consumer protection until the 1970s, when several critical studies of its activities, along with a growing consumer movement, combined to produce political pressure on the Commission to become more aggressive. The 1975 legislation increased the Commission’s power by granting it authority to promulgate rules defining unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. One of the most significant rules adopted by the Commission is designed to prevent creditors from relying on the “holder-in-due-course doctrine” to overcome various consumer defenses against debt enforcement. 40 Fed. Reg. 53,506 (1975) (codified in 16 C.F.R. pt. 433). The Commission also adopted a rule declaring unlawful a variety of creditor practices: confession of judgment clauses, wage assignments, security interests in household goods, <span title="679" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-679">p. 679</span>waivers of exemptions of property from creditor remedies, pyramiding of late charges, and cosigner liability. 49 Fed. Reg. 7740 (1984) (codified in 16 C.F.R. pt. 444). See American Financial Services Assn. v. FTC, 767 F.2d 957 (D.C. Cir. 1985), <i>cert. denied</i>, 475 U.S. 1011 (1986) (2-1 decision upholding FTC’s authority to promulgate the Credit Practices Rule).</p>
<p id="037e33c1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A number of states have enacted consumer protection statutes, many of which are modeled on the FTC Act (such statutes are often referred to as “little FTC” or “consumer fraud” acts). These acts typically give some state governmental agency, such as the office of the attorney general or the department of consumer affairs, regulatory power in consumer matters, usually including the right to bring lawsuits to protect consumers from improper conduct by sellers and creditors. See, e.g., In re National Credit Management Group, L.L.C., 21 F. Supp. 2d 424 D.N.J. 1998) (action by attorney general under New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act to enjoin certain practices in connection with the sale of credit monitoring services); People ex rel. Hartigan v. Knecht Services, Inc., 575 N.E.2d 1378 (Ill. App. Ct. 1991) (unconscionably high prices alone do not constitute an unfair practice under the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act, but the combination of an unconscionably large price, little or no service, and the absence of reasonable alternatives does violate the Act). In 2012, the attorneys general from 49 states participated with the Justice Department in a $25 billion settlement against major banks involved in abusive and fraudulent lending practices in connection with the residential mortgage crisis that began in 2007.

The statutory provisions frequently give consumers a right to recover double or treble damages for willful violations, along with attorney fees. E.g., Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 93A, §9; S.C. Code Ann. §39-5-140; Texas Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. §17.50.

<p id="037e33c2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During the 1980s and 1990s, a general social trend toward deregulation and emphasis on free-market economics made for a lessened interest in consumer protective laws and administrative oversight of the economy. In the new century, however, this began to change, particularly when the most severe financial crisis in the United States since the Great Depression reached a perilous point beginning in 2007. Home values around the country dropped precipitously and record numbers of homes went into foreclosure; life savings counted on for retirement shrank drastically; a great many people lost their jobs and had trouble finding other employment. There was a widespread feeling that failure and inadequacy of consumer protection laws and abuses by lenders and other parties during the 2000s contributed to the economic calamity. As a response, President Barack Obama proposed the establishment of a new federal consumer protection agency that would consolidate responsibility for supervision and enforcement of laws governing consumer financial products and services. In July 2010, Congress passed and President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. This Act created the Consumer Financial <span title="680" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-680">p. 680</span>Protection Bureau (CFPB), which assumed responsibility for a number of federal consumer protection efforts that had previously rested with the Federal Trade Commission or other agencies, as well as taking on new watchdog efforts. For a brief description of the creation of the CFPB, see Administrative Law — Agency Design — Dodd-Frank Act Creates the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 124 Harv. L. Rev. 2123 (2011).

<p id="037e33c5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the most part, this chapter has focused on situations in which a party may have a defense against enforceability of a contract because of some bargaining misconduct by the other party. In this section, we examine situations in which, although the process of contract formation is untainted, a contract may still be unenforceable because the contract itself either violates or runs directly contrary to some public policy. Such contracts are often said to be unenforceable because of “illegality,” but that term is a misnomer because in many situations the contract itself is not, strictly speaking, illegal. See E. Allan Farnsworth, Contracts §5.1, at 315 (4th ed. 2004).</p>
<p id="037e33c6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Judicial refusal to enforce a promise because it violates some standard of public policy has early roots in the common law. Fifteenth and sixteenth century courts refused to enforce contracts that involved usury. Similarly, contracts in “restraint of trade” were held invalid. For example, in John Dyer’s Case, 2 Hen. V, f. 5, p. 26 (1414), an action on a bond, the defendant pleaded by way of defense that he had satisfied his obligation to refrain from engaging in his profession of dyer in a certain town for one-half a year. Commenting on the pleadings, the judge stated that the defendant could have demurred to the bond because the condition was against the common law and thereby void. See Alfred W. B. Simpson, A History of the Common Law of Contract 506-524 (1987). The materials that follow examine some contemporary aspects of public policy limitations on the enforceability of contractual obligations.</p>

<p id="037e5ae5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1985, Valley Medical Specialists (“VMS”), a professional corporation, hired Steven S. Farber, D.O., an internist and pulmonologist who, among other things, treated AIDS and HIV-positive patients and performed brachytherapy—a procedure that radiates the inside of the lung in lung cancer patients. Brachytherapy can only be performed at certain hospitals that have the necessary equipment. A few years after joining VMS, Dr. Farber became a shareholder and subsequently a minority officer and director. In 1991, the three directors, including Dr. Farber, entered into new stock and employment agreements. The employment agreement contained a restrictive covenant, the scope of which was amended over time.</p>

<p id="037e8201-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">VMS filed a complaint against Dr. Farber seeking (1) preliminary and permanent injunctions enjoining Dr. Farber from violating the restrictive covenant, (2) liquidated damages for breach of the employment agreement, and (3) damages for breach of fiduciary duty, conversion of patient files and confidential information, and intentional interference with contractual and/or business relations.</p>
<p id="037e8202-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Following six days of testimony and argument, the trial court denied VMS’s request for a preliminary injunction, finding that the restrictive covenant violated public policy or, alternatively, was unenforceable because it was too broad. Specifically, the court found that: any covenant over six months would be unreasonable; the five-mile radius from each of the three VMS offices was unreasonable because it covered a total of 235 square miles; and the restriction was unreasonable because it did not provide an exception for emergency medical aid and was not limited to pulmonology.</p>
<p id="037e8203-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="683" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-683">p. 683</span>The court of appeals reversed, concluding that a modified covenant was reasonable. Valley Med. Specialists v. Farber, 190 Ariz. 563, 950 P.2d 1184 (App. 1997). The court noted that there were eight hospitals outside the restricted area where Dr. Farber could practice. Id. at 567, 950 P.2d at 1188. Although the covenant made no exceptions for emergency medicine, the court held that the severability clause permitted the trial court to modify the covenant so Dr. Farber could provide emergency services within the restricted area. Id. (citing Phoenix Orthopaedic Surgeons, Ltd. v. Peairs (<i>“Peairs”)</i>, 164 Ariz. 54, 61, 790 P.2d 752, 759 (App. 1989)). Moreover, VMS was allowed to stipulate that Dr. Farber could perform brachytherapy and treat AIDS and HIV patients within the restricted area, again even though the covenant contained no such exceptions. <i>Valley Med.

<p id="037e8204-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court of appeals found the restriction, when so modified, reasonable as to time and place.

Three years was reasonable because the record contained testimony that it might take Dr. Farber’s replacement three to five years to develop his pulmonary practice referral sources to the level they were when Dr. Farber resigned.

<p id="037e820a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A brief reference to basic principles is appropriate. Historically, covenants not to compete were viewed as restraints of trade and were invalid at common law. Ohio Urology, Inc. v. Poll, 72 Ohio App. 3d 446, 594 N.E.2d 1027, 1031 (Ohio App. 1991); see generally Harlan M. Blake, Employee Agreements not to Compete, 73 Harv. L. Rev. 625 (1960); Serena L. Kafker, Golden Handcuffs: Enforceability of Noncompetition Clauses in Professional Partnership Agreements of Accountants, Physicians, and Attorneys, 31 Am. Bus. L. J. 31, 33 (1993). Eventually, ancillary restraints, such as those incident to employment or partnership agreements, were enforced under the rule of reason. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts §188 (hereinafter “Restatement”). Given the public interest in doctor-patient relationships, the validity of restrictive covenants between physicians was carefully examined long ago in Mandeville v. Harman:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="037ea91b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rule is not that a limited restraint is good, but that it may be good. It is valid when the restraint is reasonable; and the restraint is reasonable when it imposes no shackle upon the one party which is not beneficial to the other.<span title="684" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-684">p. 684</span></p>
<p id="037ea91c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The authorities are uniform that such contracts are valid when the restraint they impose is reasonable, and the test to be applied, . . . is this: To consider whether the restraint is such only as to afford a fair protection to the interest of the party in favor of whom it is given, and not so large as to interfere with the interest of the public. Whatever restraint is larger than the necessary protection of the party can be of no benefit to either; it can only be oppressive, and, if oppressive, it is, in the eye of the law, unreasonable and void, on the ground of public policy, as being injurious to the interests of the public.</p>
</div>
<p id="037ea91d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">42 N.J. Eq. 185, 7 A. 37, 38-39 (N.J. 1886) (citations omitted); see also Karlin v. Weinberg, 77 N.J. 408, 390 A.2d 1161, 1165 (N.J. 1978). To be enforced, the restriction must do more than simply prohibit fair competition by the employee. Bryceland [v. Northey, 160 Ariz. 213, 216, 772 P.2d 36, 39 (App. 1989)]. In other words, a covenant not to compete is invalid unless it protects some legitimate interest beyond the employer’s desire to protect itself from competition. Amex Distrib. Co. v. Mascari, 150 Ariz. 510, 518, 724 P.2d 596, 604 (App. 1986). The legitimate purpose of post-employment restraints is “to prevent competitive use, for a time, of information or relationships which pertain peculiarly to the employer and which the employee acquired in the course of the employment.” Blake, supra, 73 Harv. L. Rev., at 647. Despite the freedom to contract, the law does not favor restrictive covenants. <i>Ohio Urology, Inc.,</i> 594 N.E.2d at 1031. This disfavor is particularly strong concerning such covenants among physicians because the practice of medicine affects the public to a much greater extent. Id. In fact, “for the past 60 years, the American Medical Association (AMA) has consistently taken the position that noncompetition agreements between physicians impact negatively on patient care.” Paula Berg, Judicial Enforcement of Covenants not to Compete Between Physicians: Protecting Doctors’ Interests at Patients’ Expense, 45 Rutgers L. Rev. 1, 6 (1992).</p>
<p id="037ea91e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>C. Level of Scrutiny–Public Policy Considerations</b></p>
<p id="037ea91f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We first address the level of scrutiny that should be afforded to this restrictive covenant. Dr. Farber argues that this contract is simply an employer-employee agreement and thus the restrictive covenant should be strictly construed against the employer. See <i>Amex Distrib. Co.,</i> 150 Ariz. at 514, 724 P.2d at 600 (noting employer-employee restrictive covenants are disfavored and strictly construed against the employer). This was the approach taken by the trial court. VMS contends that this is more akin to the sale of a business; thus, the noncompete provision should not be strictly construed against it. See id. (courts more lenient in enforcing restrictive covenants connected to sale of business because of need to effectively transfer goodwill). Finding the agreement here not on all fours with either approach, the court of appeals applied a standard “somewhere between” the two. <i>Valley Med. Specialists,</i> 190 Ariz. at 566, 950 P.2d at 1187.</p>
<p id="037ea920-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although this agreement is between partners, it is more analogous to an employer-employee agreement than a sale of a business. See Restatement §188 cmt. <i>h</i> (“A rule similar to that applicable to an employee or agent applies to a partner who makes a promise not to compete that is ancillary to the partnership agreement or to an agreement by which he disposes of his partnership interest.”). Many of the <span title="685" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-685">p. 685</span>concerns present in the sale of a business are not present or are reduced where, as here, a physician leaves a medical group, even when that physician is a partner. When a business is sold, the value of that business’s goodwill usually figures significantly into the purchase price. The buyer therefore deserves some protection from competition from the former owner. See Kafker, supra, 31 Am. Bus. L.J. at 33. A restraint accompanying the sale of a business is necessary for the buyer to get the full goodwill value for which it has paid. Blake, supra, 73 Harv. L. Rev., at 647.</p>
<p id="037ea921-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is true that in this case, unlike typical employer-employee agreements, Dr. Farber may not have been at a bargaining disadvantage, which is one of the reasons such restrictive covenants are strictly construed. See, e.g., Rash v. Toccoa Clinic Med. Assocs., 253 Ga. 322, 320 S.E.2d 170, 172-173 (Ga. 1984). Unequal bargaining power may be a factor to consider when examining the hardship on the departing employee. But in cases involving the professions, public policy concerns may outweigh any protectable interest the remaining firm members may have. Thus, this case does not turn on the hardship to Dr. Farber.</p>
<p id="037ea922-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By restricting a physician’s practice of medicine, this covenant involves strong public policy implications and must be closely scrutinized. See <i>Peairs,</i> 164 Ariz. at 60, 790 P.2d at 758; <i>Ohio Urology, Inc.,</i> 594 N.E.2d at 1032 (restrictive covenant in medical context “strictly construed in favor of professional mobility and access to medical care and facilities”). Although stopping short of banning restrictive covenants between physicians, the American Medical Association (“AMA”) “discourages” such covenants, finding they are not in the public interest.</p>

<p id="037ed040-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reasonableness is a fact-intensive inquiry that depends on the totality of the circumstances. <i>Bryceland,</i> 160 Ariz. at 217, 772 P.2d at 40 (“Each case hinges on its own particular facts.”); Olliver/Pilcher Ins. [v. Daniels, 148 Ariz. 530, 532, 715 P.2d 1218, 1220 (1986)]. A restriction is unreasonable and thus will not be enforced: (1) if the restraint is greater than necessary to protect the employer’s legitimate interest; or (2) if that interest is outweighed by the hardship to the employee and the likely injury to the public. See Restatement §188 cmt. <i>a</i>.; see also Blake, supra, 73 Harv. L. Rev., at 648-649; Ferdinand S. Tinio, Annotation, Validity and Construction of Contractual Restrictions on Right of Medical Practitioner to Practice, Incident to Partnership Agreement, 62 A.L.R.3d 970, 984 (1975). Thus, in the present case, the reasonableness inquiry requires us to examine the interests of the employer, employee, patients, and public in general. See 62 A.L.R.3d at 976; see also <i>Peairs,</i> 164 Ariz. at 57, 790 P.2d at 755; <i>Amex Distrib. Co.,</i> 150 Ariz. at 514, 724 P.2d at 600 (accommodating right to work, right to contract, and public’s right to competition); see generally Blake, supra. <span title="687" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-687">p. 687</span>Balancing these competing interests is no easy task and no exact formula can be used.

<p id="037ed041-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In holding this restrictive covenant enforceable, the court of appeals relied heavily on <i>Peairs,</i> noting the restriction here was “very similar to the one in <i>Peairs,</i> which restricted a doctor from practicing orthopedic medicine and surgery within a five-mile radius of each of three offices for three years.” <i>Valley Med. Specialists,</i> 190 Ariz. at 567, 950 P.2d at 1188. As noted, however, each case must be decided on its own unique facts. <i>Bryceland,</i> 160 Ariz. at 217, 772 P.2d at 40. Here, the facts are sufficiently distinguishable from <i>Peairs</i> to warrant different treatment. For instance, in <i>Peairs</i> the three offices were “clustered,” and the total restricted area was thus much smaller. 164 Ariz. at 60, 790 P.2d at 758. The <i>Peairs</i> restrictive covenant prevented the practice of “orthopedic medicine and surgery.” Id. at 56, 790 P.2d at 754. Here, however, the covenant prohibited Dr. Farber from providing any and all forms of “medical care,” including not only pulmonology, but emergency medicine, brachytherapy treatment, and HIV-positive and AIDS patient care. Finally, the trial court in <i>Peairs</i> granted the preliminary injunction, while the trial court here denied it. Because we review the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion, the trial judge’s ruling after hearing the evidence in both cases is another factor that distinguishes the two cases.</p>

<p id="037ef753-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">VMS contends, and the court of appeals agreed, that it has a protectable interest in its patients and referral sources. In the commercial context, it is clear that employers have a legitimate interest in retaining their customer base. See, e.g., <i>Bryceland,</i> 160 Ariz. at 217, 772 P.2d at 40. “The employer’s point of view is that the company’s clientele is an asset of value which has been acquired by virtue of effort and expenditures over a period of time, and which should be protected as a form of property.” Blake, supra, 73 Harv. L. Rev. at 654. In the medical context, however, the personal relationship between doctor and patient as well as the patient’s freedom to see a particular doctor, affects the extent of the employer’s interest. See <i>Ohio Urology Inc.,</i> 594 N.E.2d at 1031-1032. “The practice of a physician is a thing so purely personal, depending so absolutely on the confidence reposed in his personal skill and ability, that when he ceases to exist it necessarily ceases also. . . .” <i>Mandeville,</i> 7 A. at 40-41 (holding medical practice’s patient base is not protectable interest); see also Berg, supra, 45 Rutgers L. Rev. at 17.</p>
<p id="037ef754-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even in the commercial context, the employer’s interest in its customer base is balanced with the employee’s right to the customers. Where the employee took an active role and brought customers with him or her to the job, courts are more reluctant to enforce restrictive covenants. Blake, supra, 73 Harv. L. Rev. at 664, 667. Dr. Farber was a pulmonologist. He did not learn his skills from VMS. Restrictive covenants are designed to protect an employer’s customer base by preventing “a skilled employee from leaving an employer and, based on his skill acquired from that employment, luring away the employer’s clients or business while the employer is vulnerable—that is—before the employer has had a chance to replace the employee with someone qualified to do the job.” <i>Bryceland,</i> 160 <span title="688" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-688">p. 688</span>Ariz. at 217, 772 P.2d at 40. These facts support the trial judge’s conclusion that VMS’s interest in protecting its patient base was outweighed by other factors.</p>
<p id="037ef755-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree with VMS, however, that it has a protectable interest in its referral sources. See Medical Specialists, Inc. v. Sleweon, 652 N.E.2d 517, 523 (Ind. App. 1995) (“Clearly, the continued success of [a specialty] practice, which is dependent upon patient referrals, is a legitimate interest worthy of protection.”); Ballesteros v. Johnson, 812 S.W.2d 217, 223 (Mo. App. 1991).</p>

<p id="037ef757-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The restriction cannot be greater than necessary to protect VMS’s legitimate interests. A restraint’s scope is defined by its duration and geographic area. The frequency of contact between doctors and their patients affects the permissible length of the restraint. Blake, supra, 73 Harv. L. Rev. at 659. The idea is to give the employer a reasonable amount of time to overcome the former employee’s loss, usually by hiring a replacement and giving that replacement time to establish a working relationship. Id. Even in the commercial context, “[w]hen the restraint is for the purpose of protecting customer relationships, its duration is reasonable only if it is no longer than necessary for the employer to put a new man on the job and for the new employee to have a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate his effectiveness to the customers.” <i>Amex Distrib. Co.,</i> 150 Ariz. at 518, 724 P.2d at 604 (quoting Blake, supra, 73 Harv. L. Rev. at 677).</p>
<p id="037ef758-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, the trial judge found that the three-year period was an unreasonable duration because</p>

<p id="037ef759-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">all of the experts agree that the practice of pulmonology entails treating patients with chronic conditions which require more hospital care than office care and which requires regular contact with the treating physician at least once within each six-month period so that any provision over six months is onerous and unnecessary to protect VMS’s economic interests where virtually all of Dr. Farber’s VMS patients had an opportunity by late 1994 or early 1995 (Farber left September 12, 1994) to decide which pulmonologist . . . they would consult for their ongoing treatment[.]</p>

<p id="037ef75b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The activity prohibited by the restraint also defines the covenant’s scope. The restraint must be limited to the particular speciality of the present employment. See Blake, supra, 73 Harv. L. Rev. at 676. On its face, the restriction here is not limited to internal medicine or even pulmonology. It precludes any type of practice, even in fields that do not compete with VMS. Thus, we agree with the trial judge that this restriction is too broad. Compare <i>Peairs,</i> 164 Ariz. at 56, 790 P.2d at 754 (upholding injunction that enforced restrictive covenant preventing doctor from practicing only orthopaedic medicine and orthopaedic surgery).</p>

Even if we assume other pulmonologists will be available to cover Dr. Farber’s patients, we disagree with this view. It ignores the significant interests of individual patients within the restricted area. Kafker, supra, 31 Am. Bus. L.J. at 39-40. A court must evaluate the extent to which enforcing the covenant would foreclose patients from seeing the departing physician if they desire to do so. See <i>Karlin,</i> 390 A.2d at 1170; see also AMA Opinions, Section 9.06.</p>

On its face, however, the restriction is broader than that, restricting him from providing “medical care or medical assistance for any person or persons who were <span title="690" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-690">p. 690</span>patients or [sic] Employer during the period that Employee was in the hire of Employer.” Arizona courts will “blue pencil” restrictive covenants, eliminating grammatically severable, unreasonable provisions. See <i>Amex Distrib. Co.,</i> 150 Ariz. at 514, 724 P.2d at 600; <i>Olliver/Pilcher Ins.,</i> 148 Ariz. at 533, 715 P.2d at 1221 (“If it is clear from its terms that a contract was intended to be severable, the court can enforce the lawful part and ignore the unlawful part.”). Here, however, the modifications go further than cutting grammatically severable portions. The court of appeals, in essence, rewrote the agreement in an attempt to make it enforceable. This goes too far. “Where the severability of the agreement is not evident from the contract itself, the court cannot create a new agreement for the parties to uphold the contract.” <i>Olliver/Pilcher Ins.,</i> 148 Ariz. at 533, 715 P.2d at 1221.</p>
<p id="037f1e78-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even the blue pencil rule has its critics. For every agreement that makes its way to court, many more do not. Thus, the words of the covenant have an <i>in terrorem</i> effect on departing employees. See Blake, supra, 73 Harv. L. Rev. at 682-83. Employers may therefore create ominous covenants, knowing that if the words are challenged, courts will modify the agreement to make it enforceable. Id. Although we will tolerate ignoring severable portions of a covenant to make it more reasonable, we will not permit courts to add terms or rewrite provisions.</p>
<p id="037f1e79-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In modifying the agreement, the court of appeals cited <i>Peairs,</i> which indeed allowed the trial court to alter the restrictive covenant in a contract “between medical professionals whose services are necessary for the welfare of the public.” 164 Ariz. at 61, 790 P.2d at 759. We disapprove of the portion of <i>Peairs</i> that permits courts to rewrite and create a restrictive covenant significantly different from that created by the parties.</p>

<p id="037f1e7b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We hold that the restrictive covenant between Dr. Farber and VMS cannot be enforced. Valley Medical Specialists’ interest in enforcing the restriction is outweighed by the likely injury to patients and the public in general. See Restatement §188. In so holding, we need not reach the question of the hardship imposed on Dr. Farber. The public policy implications here are enough to invalidate this particular agreement. We stop short of holding that restrictive covenants between physicians will never be enforced, but caution that such restrictions will be strictly construed. The burden is on the party wishing to enforce the covenant to demonstrate that the restraint is no greater than necessary to protect the employer’s legitimate interest, and that such interest is not outweighed by the hardship to the employee and the likely injury to the public. Here VMS has not met that burden. The restriction fails because its public policy implications outweigh the legitimate interests of VMS.</p>
<p id="037f1e7c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dr. Farber listed in his petition for review several issues “presented to, but not decided by, the court of appeals.” Valley Medical Specialists’ response also contained “additional issues if the court accepts review.” None of the issues were briefed in this court. We thus remand to the court of appeals for a determination of those issues that are capable of decision and still need to be decided.</p>

See, e.g., Swavely v. Freeway Ford Truck Sales, 700 N.E.2d 181 (Ill. App. Ct. 1998) (because public policy strongly favors freedom to contract, courts should refuse enforcement only if contract is clearly contrary to public policy found in constitutions, statutes, or court decisions); Beacon Hill Civic Ass’n. v. Ristorante Toscano, Inc., 662 N.E.2d 1015 (Mass. 1996) (freedom of contract is in the public interest; courts should “not go out of their way” to find inconsistency with public policy). Does the court reveal any evidence that the parties in <i>Valley Medical</i> did not freely enter into the contract?

The rationale for this prohibition was that such agreements tend to restrain competition and thereby harm the public interest. John E. Murray, Jr., Murray on Contracts 571 (5th ed. 2011). However, the common law also recognized a number of exceptions to this prohibition. In United States v.

<p id="037f4594-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Restatement (Second) preserves the common law rule that a covenant not to compete is unenforceable unless it is “ancillary” to a valid transaction. <span title="692" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-692">p. 692</span>Restatement (Second) §187. Section 188 defines restraints that are ancillary to a valid transaction or relationship to include the following: a promise by a seller of a business not to compete with the buyer so as to injure the business sold; a promise by an employee or agent not to compete with his employer or principal; and a promise by a partner not to compete with the partnership. The clearest example of a nonancillary covenant is an agreement between competitors to fix prices.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="037f4595-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Reasonableness of covenant.</i> Consistent with Restatement (Second) Contracts §188, Comments <i>f</i> and <i>g</i>, the <i>Valley Medical</i> court recognized the level of scrutiny used in examining an ancillary covenant not to compete will depend on the type of transaction involved. A covenant related to partnership or sale of business contracts will not be scrutinized as strictly or closely as a covenant related to employment because employees are usually at a greater bargaining disadvantage and therefore need more protection from the court. The court also indicates that the assessment of the enforceability of the covenant would depend on the nature of Valley Medical’s valid protectable interest, if any. In assessing the reasonableness of the covenant, the court indicates that the general considerations are its scope, the hardship imposed on the promisor, and the public interest. More specifically, the court examines the scope of the covenant with regard to the time period covered, the geographical reach, and the scope of activities prohibited. (See also Comment <i>d</i> to Restatement (Second) §188.) What conclusions does the court reach on these issues? Are you persuaded by the court’s analysis?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="037f4596-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Covenants restraining medical practice.</i> Even though the public interest in the practice of medicine is significant, a majority of courts, like the Arizona Supreme Court in <i>Valley Medical</i>, have declined to adopt “per se” rules that would invalidate all such covenants. See, e.g., Deutsch v. Barsky, 795 A.2d 669 (D.C. 2002) (stating that court has never held that ancillary covenants between dentists are per se violation of public policy; rule of reason to be applied); Pierson v. Medical Health Centers, P.A., 869 A.2d 901 (N.J. 2005) (rejecting argument that covenants by doctors should be invalid per se). Notwithstanding the majority approach, some state legislatures have enacted statutes that expressly prohibit covenants not to compete among physicians, and courts in other states have construed more general statutory prohibitions on non-compete covenants to apply to physicians. See Murfreesboro Medical Clinic, P.A. v. Udom, 166 S.W.3d 674 (Tenn. 2005) (citing express statutory prohibitions in Colorado, Delaware, and Massachusetts and judicial construction banning covenants not to compete among physicians in six other states; court decided that such covenants are per se unenforceable in Tennessee except as specifically allowed by statute).</p>
<p id="037f4597-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As <i>Valley Medical</i> illustrates, of course, a covenant restraining medical practice may still be unreasonable even though not unenforceable per se. See, e.g., Nalle Clinic Co. v. Parker, 399 S.E.2d 363 (N.C. Ct. App. 1991) (covenant by doctor not to practice medicine or surgery for two years in particular county was invalid because of harm to public when county had only one other pediatric endocrinologist).

<li class=""><p id="037f4598-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Public policy based on statutes.</i> As the prior note indicates, some states have enacted statutes that govern covenants not to compete among physicians. The Restatement (Second) §179, Comment <i>b</i>, states that “the declaration of public policy has now become largely the province of legislators rather than judges” and courts may refuse to enforce contracts that conflict with statutory law. When statutes explicitly declare that certain contracts are unenforceable or void, courts will obey the legislative mandate. Restatement (Second) §178, Comment <i>a.</i> See, e.g., K&amp;K Services, Inc. v. City of Irwindale, 54 Cal. Rptr. 2d 836 (Ct. App. 1996) (statute provides contractor may not “bring or maintain any action” to enforce a contract unless “duly licensed” at all times during performance). In the more typical situation, the making of the contract violates or is inconsistent with a statute, but the statute is silent on the question of whether the contract is unenforceable. Generally a distinction is drawn between regulatory statutes, which are designed to protect the public, and revenue-raising measures. Violation of the latter will not generally prevent the enforceability of a contract. Grace McLane Giesel, 15 Corbin on Contracts §88.3 (Joseph M. Perillo ed. 2003). Compare Professional Property Services, Inc. v. Agler Green Townhouses, Inc., 998 F. Supp. 831 (S.D. Ohio 1998) (state requirement of license for property managers rendered contract void because statute was designed for “police or regulatory” purposes), with Benjamin v. Koeppel, 650 N.E.2d 829 (N.Y. 1995) (statute requiring that attorneys admitted to practice also register with court office and pay fee was primarily intended to raise revenue; failure to pay fee would not render attorney’s contracts unenforceable).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="037f4599-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Covenants restraining legal practice.</i> As recognized by the <i>Valley Medical</i> court, covenants by lawyers not to compete with their firms after their departure are a special case because of restrictions found in the rules of professional ethics. See Model Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 5.6, quoted in the <i>Valley Medical</i> opinion. Courts also tend to disallow provisions which apply a financial penalty to competition without purporting to prohibit practice directly. In Cohen v. Lord, Day &amp; Lord, 550 N.E.2d 410 (N.Y. 1989), the New York Court of Appeals ruled that a partnership agreement that conditioned payment of a departing partner’s share of earned but uncollected revenues on noncompetition by the former partner was unenforceable because of the ethical prohibition on restriction of practice by lawyers. The denial of enforcement to lawyers’ restrictive covenants usually is based on the strong public interest in allowing clients to retain counsel of their choice. Id. at 411.</p>

See CPG Int’l LLC v. Georgelis, 2015 U.S. Dist. Lexis 51712 (M.D. Pa.)

The Arizona Supreme Court strongly disagreed with this approach, disapproving its earlier decision that seemed to permit such modification of a covenant. At the same time, the Arizona Supreme Court endorsed a mechanical approach to possible reduction of a covenant which allows severance or reduction only if the objectionable term can literally be “lined out” and the remainder enforced. For example, in a covenant that prohibited a former employee from working for competitors in “Stephens or Comanche County,” the court could “blue pencil” or line out one of the two counties to make the geographical scope reasonable.</p>
<p id="037f459f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Reporter’s Note to Restatement (Second) §184 makes it clear that the section rejects the mechanical approach and endorses a more flexible method which allows reduction of the effect or scope of a clause to make it reasonable. Comment <i>b</i> to §184 indicates, however, that the court’s discretion to reduce a covenant should be exercised only when there is no evidence of overreaching or bad faith by the promisee. This qualified approach to granting partial enforcement allows the courts to guard against the possibility recognized by the <i>Valley Medical</i> court that employers may intentionally write overbroad covenants not to compete in anticipation that few employees will have the inclination or <span title="695" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-695">p. 695</span>ability to challenge them. Notably, however, some courts refuse to use either the traditional or more modern approach to severance to save a covenant not to compete that is flawed. See Quality Liquid Feeds, Inc. v. Plunkett, 199 S.W.3d 700, 705 (Ark. Ct. App. 2004) (covenant must be valid as written; court will not make new contract for parties); Ceramic &amp; Metal Coatings Corp. v. Hizer, 529 S.E.2d 160, 163 (Ga. Ct. App. 2000) (completely rejecting the “blue pencil theory of severability” with regard to employment contracts even if contract has severability clause).</p></li>

<p id="037f6cb7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this appeal, we must decide a question of first impression: whether gestational surrogacy contracts are enforceable under Iowa law. The plaintiffs, the intended parents, are a married couple unable to conceive their own child. They signed a contract with the defendants, the surrogate mother and her husband, who, in exchange for future payments of up to $13,000 and medical expenses, agreed to have the surrogate mother impregnated with embryos fertilized with the plaintiff-father’s sperm and the ova (eggs) of an anonymous donor. The defendants agreed to deliver the baby at birth to the intended parents. The surrogate mother became pregnant with twins, but after demanding additional payments, refused to honor the agreement. The babies were born prematurely, and one died. The intended parents sued to enforce the contract and gain custody of the surviving child. The district court, after genetic testing, ruled the contract is enforceable, terminated the presumptive parental rights of the surrogate mother and her husband, established paternity in the biological father, and awarded him permanent legal and physical custody. The defendants appealed, and we retained the case.</p>
<p id="037f6cb8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the reasons explained below, we affirm the rulings of the district court. We hold this gestational surrogacy contract is legally enforceable in favor of the intended, biological father against a surrogate mother and her husband who are not the child’s genetic parents. The intended parents would not have entrusted their embryos to the surrogate mother, and this child would not have been born, without their reliance on the surrogate’s contractual commitment. A contrary holding invalidating surrogacy contracts would deprive infertile couples of the opportunity to raise their own biological children and would limit the personal autonomy of women willing to serve as surrogates to carry and deliver a baby to be raised by other loving parents. The district court properly established paternity in the biological father based on the undisputed DNA evidence and terminated the presumptive parental rights of the surrogate mother and her husband. The district court correctly awarded permanent custody of the child to the biological, intended father.<span title="696" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-696">p. 696</span></p>

<p id="037f6cba-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">P.M. and C.M. were high school sweethearts but parted ways when P.M. joined the Navy upon graduation. After marrying and divorcing other spouses, they reconnected and married each other in 2013. They now live in Cedar Rapids. P.M. had two children from his first marriage, and C.M. had four children from hers. The Ms were nearing age fifty and wanted to have a child together. C.M. was no longer able to conceive, so the Ms placed an advertisement on Craigslist in 2015 seeking a woman willing to act as a surrogate mother.</p>
<p id="037f6cbb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">T.B. and D.B. married each other in January 2009 and live in Muscatine. T.B. has four children from a prior marriage; D.B. has no children and had never been married. The Bs want to have children together. In 2010, T.B. had a tubal pregnancy which was life-threatening and incapable of leading to the birth of a viable child, so she surgically terminated the pregnancy. T.B. and D.B. continued to try to conceive without success. The Bs realized they would need the services of a reproductive endocrinologist in order to have a child. T.B. learned that the Bs’ insurance would not cover infertility treatment or in vitro fertilization (IVF). They decided they needed to supplement D.B.’s income to pay for assisted reproduction procedures.</p>
<p id="037f6cbc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">T.B. responded to the Ms’ Craigslist advertisement. The four met for dinner in Coralville and got along well at first. They agreed that T.B. would gestate two embryos fertilized in vitro with P.M.’s sperm and the eggs of an anonymous donor. The Ms selected Midwest Fertility Clinic (Midwest) in Downers Grove, Illinois, to perform the IVF and embryo transfers. Midwest required a written contract between the parties, so the Ms hired a lawyer to draft the agreement. Its stated purpose was “to enable the Intended Father [P.M.] and the Intended Mother [C.M.] to have a child who is biologically related to one of them.” In exchange for the gestational service, the Ms agreed to pay up to $13,000 for an IVF procedure for T.B. to enable her and D.B. to conceive their own child. This payment was conditioned upon T.B. surrendering custody of a live child upon birth.</p>

<p id="037f6cc7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On March 27, Midwest implanted two embryos into T.B.’s uterus. The embryos were the ova of an anonymous donor fertilized with P.M.’s sperm. On April 4, blood testing confirmed T.B.’s pregnancy. The parties’ relationship soon began to break down over their disagreement as to payment of medical expenses. All four attended the first ultrasound, which D.B. videotaped. The Ms later objected to his videotaping and to T.B. posting information about the baby on social media.</p>
<p id="037f6cc8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Their relationship worsened after the women exchanged text messages on April 13 [in a dispute about scheduling a doctor’s appointment during which each woman called the other “crazy.”] The Bs retained an attorney to speak for them and cut off direct communication with the Ms, who nevertheless persisted in trying to reach them for updates on the pregnancy.</p>
<p id="037f6cc9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a May 20 letter from her attorney, T.B. sought more money from the Ms beyond the $13,000 agreed to in their contract so she could use a costlier clinic for her own IVF. T.B. wanted to replace Midwest because it insisted she use her own medical insurance and because C.M. told her Midwest employees said T.B. was crazy. The clinic T.B. wanted to use charged over twice as much—$30,000—for IVF. T.B. insisted that the Ms pay the higher cost for her to continue to serve as a gestational carrier.</p>
<p id="037f93da-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On August 19, P.M. sent Facebook messages to D.B.’s sister, using racial slurs and profanity to insult D.B. D.B.’s sister shared the communication with T.B. On August 24, C.M. sent an email to T.B. and T.B.’s attorney, triggering a lengthy exchange, during which C.M. called T.B. the “N” word. That statement, along with the comments P.M. sent to D.B.’s sister, convinced T.B. that the Ms <span title="698" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-698">p. 698</span>were racist. T.B. then called the Ms’ attorney. When T.B. expressed concern that the Ms would not pay her, the Ms’ attorney assured T.B. that the money for the Bs had already been set aside. The Ms’ attorney attempted to make payment arrangements with T.B. and arrange P.M.’s listing on the birth certificate, but those matters remained unresolved. Later that day, T.B. decided that she would not turn over the babies to the Ms.</p>
<p id="037f93db-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Twin babies were born thirteen weeks prematurely on August 31. T.B. did not tell the Ms about the birth. The babies were placed in the neonatal intensive care unit. One died eight days after birth. T.B. did not inform the Ms about the baby’s illness or death. The Bs unilaterally arranged for the deceased baby’s cremation.</p>
<p id="037f93dc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On October 24, the Ms, still unaware of the birth, filed a petition for declaratory judgment and temporary and permanent injunction. On October 31, the Ms filed a motion for an emergency ex parte injunction, alleging their belief that the babies had been born. The same day, the district court entered an order granting a temporary injunction that ordered T.B. and D.B. to surrender custody of “Baby H” to the Ms. The order prohibited T.B. and D.B. from acting inconsistently with the terms of the Surrogacy Agreement. The Ms have had physical custody of Baby H since that date.</p>
<p id="037f93dd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After an evidentiary hearing on November 28, the district court entered a ruling on December 7 denying the Bs’ application for temporary custody. At the hearing, the GAL [guardian ad litem for the child] expressed hesitation about agreeing to a shared care arrangement based on her inability to learn more about one of T.B.’s children aging out of foster care and the lack of a custodial arrangement with T.B.’s other children.

Walsh, <i>Wisconsin’s Undeveloped Surrogacy Law</i>, 85-Mar. Wis. Law. 16, 16 (2012) [hereinafter Walsh]). The woman who carries the child is the “surrogate mother.” An “intended parent” is “an individual . . . who manifests the intent . . . to be legally bound as the parent of a child resulting from assisted or collaborative reproduction.” <i>Id.</i>. . . . Surrogacies are categorized as “traditional” or “gestational.” <i>Id.</i></p>

In a gestational surrogacy, the surrogate is not genetically related to the child; instead, “sperm is taken from the father (or from a donor) and an egg is taken from the mother (or from a donor), fertilization happens outside the womb (called <i>in vitro</i> fertilization), and the fertilized embryos are then implanted into the surrogate mother’s uterus.”</p>

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="037fbafe-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, some states have legislatively prohibited all surrogacy contracts, declaring their terms unenforceable and, in some instances, imposing criminal penalties for those who attempt to enter into or assist in creating such a contract. <i>See, e.g.</i>, D.C. Code §§ 16–401(4)(A)–(B),–402(a) (prohibiting all “[s]urrogate parenting contracts” as defined by statute); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §§ 722.851–.863 (declaring surrogate parentage contracts, as defined by statute, to be “void and unenforceable” and imposing criminal penalties for participation in a “surrogate parentage contract for compensation” or a surrogacy contract involving a surrogate who is an unemancipated minor or who has “a mental illness or developmental disability”). A second category of states prohibit only certain types of surrogacy contracts—typically those involving a traditional surrogacy. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 199.590(4) (prohibiting traditional surrogacy contracts, as defined by statute, without addressing gestational surrogacies); N.D. Cent. Code §§ 14–18–05, –08 (declaring traditional surrogacy agreements void but allowing gestational surrogacies by providing that “[a] child born to a gestational carrier is a child of the intended parents for all purposes and is not a child of the gestational carrier and the gestational carrier’s husband, if any”). Finally, states in the third category authorize both traditional and gestational surrogacy contracts, subject to regulation and specified limitations. <i>See, e.g.</i>, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 168–B:1 to –B:32 (generally permitting traditional and gestational surrogacy agreements subject to certain conditions, including a traditional surrogate’s right to revoke the agreement within seventy-two hours of birth); Va. Code Ann. §§ 20–156 to 20–165 (generally permitting surrogacy contracts, as defined by statute, and providing a multi-step process for judicial pre-approval of such contracts); Wash. Rev. Code Ann. §§ 26.26.210–.260 (generally permitting traditional and gestational surrogacy agreements but prohibiting compensation beyond reasonable expenses and agreements involving a surrogate who is “an unemancipated minor female or a female diagnosed as having an intellectual disability, a mental illness, or developmental disability”).</p>

<p id="03800930-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Baby M</i>, a married couple, William and Elizabeth Stern, wanted to raise a child, but Elizabeth feared her medical condition rendered pregnancy a serious health risk. <i>Id.</i> Mr. Stern’s family had perished in the Holocaust, and as the “only survivor, he very much wanted to continue his bloodline.” <i>Id.</i> He responded to the advertisements of a fertility clinic. <i>Id.</i> at 1236. So did Mary Beth Whitehead, who was motivated by “her sympathy with family members and others who could have no children (she stated that she wanted to give another couple the ‘gift of life’); she also wanted . . . $10,000 to help her family.” <i>Id.</i> Stern and Whitehead entered into a surrogacy contract. <i>Id.</i> “The contract provided that through artificial insemination using Mr. Stern’s sperm, Mrs. Whitehead would become pregnant, carry the child to term, . . .

Whitehead, however, had developed a strong emotional attachment. <i>Id.</i> When the Sterns arrived at the hospital to see the baby, Whitehead “broke into tears and . . . talked about how the baby looked like her other daughter.” <i>Id.</i> She made clear to the Sterns that she was unsure she could give up the child. <i>Id.</i> Three days after the birth, she turned the baby over to the Sterns, who “were thrilled with their new child.” <i>Id.</i> But their legal battle ensued over custody and contract rights, with the New Jersey Supreme Court ultimately invalidating the surrogacy contract, awarding custody of the child to the Sterns, and allowing Whitehead visitation. <i>Id.</i> at 1234, 1263. While concluding that New Jersey’s “present laws do not permit the surrogacy contract used in this case[,]” the court held “the Legislature remains free to deal with this most sensitive issue as it sees fit, subject only to constitutional restraints.” <i>Id.</i> at 1264.</p>
<p id="03800931-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude, based on the timing of the enactment of Iowa Code section 710.11, the very next legislative session, that our state’s general assembly chose in 1989 to allow surrogacy arrangements, not prohibit them. Section 710.11 specifically mentions artificial insemination of the birth mother (who is the genetic or biological mother, as in <i>Baby M</i>), but we decline to infer the legislature intended to allow only traditional surrogacy when the birth mother is the genetic mother and yet criminalize gestational surrogacy arrangements. IVF, allowing implantation in the surrogate mother of embryos from donor eggs, was then in its infancy and had not been the subject of a court decision of national prominence. As other courts have noted, a gestational surrogacy in <span title="704" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-704">p. 704</span>which the birth mother lacks a genetic connection to the child raises fewer concerns than the traditional surrogacy expressly mentioned in section 710.11. The legislature’s decision to allow traditional surrogacy arrangements can be taken as a signal that it would also allow gestational surrogacy arrangements. We conclude that neither traditional nor gestational surrogacy contracts are prohibited under section 710.11.</p>
<p id="03800932-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our conclusion is reinforced by the regulations adopted by the DPH that specifically contemplate IVF gestational surrogacy agreements. The regulations are entitled “Establishment of new certificate of live birth following a birth by gestational surrogate arrangement.” <i>See</i> Iowa Admin. Code r. 641—99.15.

Certainly in the present case it cannot seriously be argued that Anna, a licensed vocational nurse who had done well in school and who had previously borne a child, lacked the intellectual wherewithal or life experience necessary to make an informed decision to enter into the surrogacy contract.</p>

<li class=""><p id="03803060-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Public policy and surrogacy contracts.</i> The <i>P.M. v. T.B.</i> court emphatically stated that the public policy favoring freedom of contract is very strong and thus courts should be reluctant to deny enforcement of a contract that was properly made by consenting adults. Nevertheless, the <i>P.M. v. T.B.</i> decision raised a number of potential public policy concerns that might justify a refusal to enforce a surrogacy contract, including statutory prohibitions against “baby selling,” statutorily mandated waiting-periods before a mother can consent to adoption, possible adverse effect on the children, potential exploitation of women, and laws favoring preservation of families and restricting termination of parental rights. On the other hand, the Iowa state legislature specifically exempted traditional or genetic surrogacy contracts from the criminal law prohibiting baby selling and arguably exempted gestational surrogacy as well. The <i>P.M. v. T.B.</i> court also underscored the beneficial effects of surrogacy arrangements in allowing parents to have biological children when they <span title="708" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-708">p. 708</span>otherwise might not be able to do so. Do you agree with the <i>P.M. v. T.B.</i> court’s conclusion that gestational surrogacy contracts should not be deemed to violate public policy? What about traditional or genetic surrogacy contracts?</p>
<p id="03803061-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As suggested by the <i>P.M. v. T.B.</i> opinion, there is reason to believe that numerous surrogacy contracts are performed by the parties without difficulty. See Julia Dalzell, The Enforcement of Selective Reduction Clauses in Surrogacy Contracts, 27 Widener Commonwealth L. Rev. 83, 83-84 (2018) (reporting estimate of 2,000 gestational surrogacy births in 2014, most of them completed without problem). The development of the extreme animosity between the parties in <i>P.M. v. T.B.</i>, however, reveals how much conflict can arise when the surrogacy contract does not go well. Indeed, the cases from other jurisdictions cited in the <i>P.M. v. T.B.</i> opinion, such as the <i>Baby M</i> case from New Jersey and <i>Calvert v. Johnson</i> from California, also involved severe disruptions in relations between the surrogate and the intended parents. Does the occurrence of this type of problem provide another potential policy argument for denying enforcement to surrogacy contracts?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03805672-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Public policy and family relations.</i> The courts recognize a general public policy limit on contracts that are deemed to impair or harm family relations. Restatement (Second) §§189, 190 address promises that are unreasonably in restraint of marriage and promises that are detrimental to marital relationships. The Restatement (Second) §191 provides, more specifically, that a contract affecting the custody of a child is unenforceable on grounds of public policy unless it is consistent with the “best interest of the child.” Note that the trial court in <i>P.M. v. T.B.</i> ruled that granting the intended father custody was in the best interest of the child in addition to holding that the surrogacy contract was enforceable. What should the court have done if it concluded that the intended father was not well-suited to have custody?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03805673-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Judicial and legislative roles.</i> The court in <i>P.M. v. T.B.</i> cites both legislation and court decisions from other jurisdictions in support of its approach to determining the enforceability of the surrogate-parenting contract. Based on the description of state statutory laws given in <i>P.M. v. T.B.</i>, do you favor legislation to govern the validity of surrogacy contracts? If so, what form of legislation would you support? Why? Consider the two model acts referred to by the court in its opinion. The ABA Model Act is discussed and favorably evaluated in Charles P. Kindregan, Jr. &amp; Steven H. Snyder, Clarifying the Law of ART: The New American Bar Association Model Act Governing Assisted Reproductive Technology, 42 Fam. L.Q. 203 (2008).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03805674-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The</i> Baby M <i>case.</i> The <i>P.M. v. T.B.</i> court refers in some detail to the <i>Baby M</i> case, one of the earliest and best known traditional surrogacy contract decisions. In re Baby M., 537 A.2d 1227 (N.J. 1988). The contract in that case called for payment of $10,000 to the surrogate and, as noted by the court in <i>P.M. v. T.B.</i>, stipulated that Mrs. Whitehead, the surrogate, would not “form or attempt to form a parent-child relationship” with the baby she had agreed to bear and would permit Mrs. Stern, the biological father’s wife, to become the baby’s legal mother. After giving birth, the surrogate decided she could not part with the child and engaged in a protracted custody battle. In deciding that the <span title="709" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-709">p. 709</span>contract was unenforceable, the New Jersey Supreme Court concluded that the agreement was inconsistent with statutory provisions that prohibit payment of money in connection with adoptions, that require proof of parental unfitness or abandonment before termination of parental rights, and that make consent to private adoptions revocable for a period after birth. Id. at 1240. In addition, however, the court ruled that the contract was fundamentally at odds with public policy. The <i>Baby M</i> case and subsequent developments in the area of surrogacy are surveyed and evaluated in J. Herbie Difonzo &amp; Ruth C. Stern, The Children of Baby M., 39 Cap. U. L. Rev. 345 (2011).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03805675-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Gestational surrogacy and public policy.</i> The <i>P.M. v. T.B.</i> case dealt with a gestational surrogacy contract and the court relied heavily on an earlier California Supreme Court case holding a gestational surrogate parenting agreement to be enforceable. Johnson v. Calvert, 851 P.2d 776, <i>cert. denied,</i> 510 U.S. 874, and <i>cert. dismissed sub nom.</i> Baby Boy J. v. Johnson, 510 U.S. 938 (1993). Anna Johnson, the surrogate, did not supply the egg for the baby. Rather, the Calverts provided both the sperm and the egg that were used to form an embryo, which was implanted by in vitro fertilization. The California Supreme Court held that state law would recognize only one natural mother and framed the key issue as whether Crispina Calvert, as the egg donor, or Anna Johnson, as the gestational surrogate, was “the mother” of the resulting child. Id. at 781. The case thus presented the challenge of applying traditional policy concepts to advances in assisted reproductive technology.</p>
<p id="03805676-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Johnson</i> court stated that it would use the surrogacy contract to decide who had the better claim as mother of the child. In contrast to the <i>Baby M</i> court, the California court rejected a number of public policy arguments against the enforceability of the contract. As noted in the <i>P.M. v. T.B.</i> opinion, the California court reasoned that gestational surrogacy does not involve surrender of parental rights for money because the surrogate is being paid only for gestating services.</p>
<p id="03805677-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notably, the only woman on the California Supreme Court at that time, Justice Joyce Kennard, filed the lone dissent in the <i>Johnson</i> case. Justice Kennard agreed with the majority that both the genetic and the gestational mothers had valid claims to be the legal mother of the child but rejected the idea that the surrogacy contract should be used to break the tie. Justice Kennard reasoned instead that the best interest of the child should be used to determine parental rights. 851 P.2d at 799. Justice Kennard emphasized that children are not “the personal property of anyone, and their delivery cannot be ordered as a contract remedy on the same terms as a court would, for example, order a breaching party to deliver a truckload of nuts and bolts.” Id. at 796-797. Justice Kennard agreed with the majority, however, that the legislature should act to provide guidance in this area. Do you think that gender differences between judges are likely to affect how such a case is viewed?</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="03805679-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Remedial options in public policy cases.</i> Courts will not necessarily deem void and completely unenforceable a contract that is inconsistent with a statute or other basis of public policy. Rather, the courts may enforce the contract or, more likely yet, may grant restitutionary relief to one of the parties if a benefit has been conferred. The Restatement (Second) adopts an approach that requires the weighing of a number of factors before denying enforcement of a contract or refusing restitutionary relief on public policy grounds, including assessing the nature of the public policy involved, the degree of resulting forfeiture, and whether denial of relief would further the policy. Restatement (Second) of Contracts §§178, 197. See Trees v. Kersey, 56 P.3d 765 (Idaho 2002) (contracts made in violation of public works licensing act were void, but court would not allow party who committed fraud to keep benefit of performance without liability); CitaraManis v. Hallowell, 613 A.2d 964 (Md. 1992) (lease for rental property made without proper license would not necessarily be unenforceable; courts must consider strength of public policy, degree of violation, and whether refund of rent would be disproportionate penalty).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0380567a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>“In pari delicto.”</i> If both parties willfully engage in wrongful conduct, and therefore are “in pari delicto” (equally culpable), the courts usually take the position that the parties should be left where the court finds them and will give no remedy to either party, even if one has received a benefit from the other. See Joseph M. Perillo, Contracts, §§22.1, 22.7 (7th ed. 2014). This rule is applied particularly where the contract involves serious illegal conduct. See, e.g., Al-Ibrahim v. Edde, 897 F. Supp. 620 (D.D.C. 1995) (employee who claimed gambling winnings of employer in plan to avoid federal income tax could not enforce employer’s promise of reimbursement of taxes paid; judicial process cannot be used to further illegal acts); but see Maudlin v. Pacific Decision Sciences Corp., 40 Cal. Rptr. 3d 724 (Ct. App. 2006) (former employee who resold stock to company was not in pari delicto where he was aware that employer structured deferred payments to evade taxes but employee derived no benefit from scheme and would have suffered forfeiture of almost $1.7 million if court left the parties where found). See generally Stewart v. Wilmington Trust SP Servs., 112 A.3d 271 (Del. Ch. 2015) (discussing the doctrine and its exceptions).</p></li>

At that time Marta was a sixty-year-old widow and mother to three children: Ben, who was thirty years old, Sara, who was twenty-five years old, and Kristin who was twenty years old. Marta’s husband, Frank, died in an accident ten years earlier <span title="711" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-711">p. 711</span>and Marta used the proceeds from his life insurance policy to pay the balance on her mortgage so that she owned the house free of debt. The family home was located at 675 Park Street in the city of Clearview and had a fair market value of about $250,000.</p>
<p id="0380567e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ben and Sara each left home as soon as they graduated from high school and, due to very strained relations with Marta, they both rarely visited the family home or spoke with their mother. Kristin continued to live in the family home with Marta while she attended college and worked part-time at a coffee shop. Ben attended college for a year before taking a job as a salesperson for a bakery company. Sara completed an Associate’s Degree program in business administration and worked as a real estate paralegal.</p>
<p id="0380567f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">About two years earlier, in July 2016, Marta suffered a sudden heart attack. Though she recovered well enough to leave the hospital after a week-long stay, her doctor advised Marta that permanent physical damage had been done and that she was at high risk for a recurrence of heart problems. Marta spent most of her savings on medical bills and realized that the only significant asset she owned was the family home. On August 11, 2016, Marta went to see an attorney and executed a deed conveying the family home to her youngest child, Kristin, reserving a life estate for herself. The deed was recorded that day. Neither Marta nor Kristin informed Ben or Sara about the transfer of ownership. Marta did not have a will.</p>
<p id="03805680-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On hearing of Marta’s death, Ben and Sara came to the family home on Monday evening to make funeral arrangements. All three agreed that Marta should be interred next to Frank in the local cemetery after funeral services the following Friday, September 7. The funeral parlor quoted a total price of $12,000 for all services, including posting an advance notice in the newspaper. The three siblings began to discuss how that cost would be paid. Marta died with only $700 in her bank account. Kristin had only about $3000 that she needed to pay her next tuition bill. Ben and Sara then said they would split the funeral cost and take reimbursement when the family home was sold and the proceeds divided into three equal shares.</p>
<p id="03805681-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At that point, Kristin told Ben and Sara that Marta had given the house to Kristin, alone, and that she did not plan to sell it. Kristin said she could work extra hours to get the money to pay Ben and Sara back for her share of the funeral expenses, but it would take several months. Ben and Sara were outraged to hear that they had been excluded from ownership of the family home. Sara said heatedly, “I work with lawyers who can undo the deed and you will end up with nothing.” Ben added, “Kristin, you need to do the right thing and share the value of the house.” Ben and Sara came back to see Kristin the next two evenings and they restated their objections to Kristin keeping the family home for herself. Kristin’s response was always the same, “I need time to think about it.”</p>
<p id="03805682-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On Thursday evening, the night before the scheduled funeral services, Ben and Sara came back to the family home once again to speak with Kristin about selling the house. This time Sara came with a typewritten document which read,<span title="712" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-712">p. 712</span></p>

<p id="03807d94-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sara told Kristin, “If you do not sign this contract, I will call the funeral home this evening and cancel the funeral services and burial.

And I will still have the deed voided.” Kristin asked Ben if he agreed with Sara. Ben replied, “It is only right for you to share the value of the house with us.” Kristin then signed the document.

<p id="03807d98-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Arturo Guillen is president and the majority stockholder in Hydrazone Systems, Inc., a small company that manufactures and installs patented equipment designed to simulate ocean waves. Hydrazone is incorporated in the state of New London and is a duly licensed contractor in that state. Mirage Waterpark Company owns and operates a water-oriented amusement park in the neighboring state of Ada. On January 15, 2019, Guillen contracted on behalf of Hydrazone with Mirage to design and manufacture for the park a 29,000-square-foot “surfing pool” using Hydrazone wave equipment. Mirage was represented by its president, Anna Patton. The contract provided for a price of “$750,000 for equipment” and “a maximum of $250,000 in fees for services as necessary to assist in installation.” The contract provided that Hydrazone would charge an agreed hourly rate for the services of its employees in assisting with installation. The contract stated that delivery was to be completed in time to allow for installation by May 15, 2019. Patton said that Mirage would primarily use its staff in installation and use a local contractor, if necessary. Mirage was entitled to hold back “10% of total charges as retainage,” pending satisfactory completion and operation of the pool.</p>
<p id="03807d99-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After signing the contract with Mirage, Guillen became concerned about Ada’s contractor licensing statute, which he understood would apply to the new installation. Guillen wrote to Patton on February 1, 2019, stating that Hydrazone wished only to sell and deliver its equipment and to avoid involvement in installation or construction of the pool because of the licensing law. In a letter dated February 9, 2019, Patton responded that “Hydrazone’s expertise is essential to proper installation of the equipment” and that Mirage would “hold Hydrazone to its commitment to assist in construction.” Patton also promised that she would arrange for a friend who was an Ada licensed <span title="713" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-713">p. 713</span>contractor “to sign any necessary paperwork and accept any formal liability for the work.” After this exchange of correspondence, Hydrazone started delivery of the equipment and began assisting Mirage staff in initial layout on March 1, 2019.</p>
<p id="03807d9a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By March 15, Guillen became concerned again that no state licensed contractor was involved in the installation. Upon inquiry by Guillen, Patton stated that her friend was tied up but would start assisting later. Guillen then stated that Hydrazone would cease any work until a licensed contractor was brought on board. Patton responded by stating that Mirage would refuse further payment, even for the $250,000 of equipment that had been delivered, and would hold Hydrazone liable for any lost profits if the wave pool was not operational by the beginning of the 2019 summer season. Because his company was fully extended financially due to three concurrent projects, Guillen needed prompt payment from Mirage to meet his regular operating expenses. Thus, although he continued to complain regularly, Guillen directed Hydrazone employees to continue with the installation. By May 15, the pool was completely installed, primarily by Hydrazone employees. Guillen had charged the full $1,000,000 for equipment and services, and had been paid $800,000. Patton never arranged for an Ada contractor to work with Hydrazone.</p>
<p id="03807d9b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The wave pool performed as specified in the contract during the 2019 summer season. After requesting payment of the $200,000 balance, Guillen received on August 1, 2019, a check for $100,000, which he had his financial manager deposit. Patton, however, refused to release the final $100,000 in retainage that had not been paid to Hydrazone. When Guillen complained to Patton, she told him that his last progress payment of $100,000 had been accompanied by a letter that stated it was final payment in full discharge of the contract. Guillen checked his files and discovered in fact that a form letter with a great deal of fine print had been enclosed with the check and that it had included such language. Neither Guillen nor his financial officer had read the form letter before negotiating the check. Hydrazone then filed suit against Mirage to collect the final $100,000.</p>

<p id="03807da4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You are an attorney with the local legal services program, where you handle a general caseload comprising consumer, welfare, and domestic matters. A 17-year-old girl, Samantha Brown, has come into your office and tells you the following story.</p>
<p id="03807da5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">About 18 months ago, Samantha became pregnant. When her mother learned about this, she was furious. Her boyfriend offered to get her an abortion, but Samantha refused, saying that it was wrong. Her pregnancy was extremely difficult, and she was hospitalized for two weeks before giving birth to a daughter, named DeAnna. Because of Samantha’s difficult pregnancy, her doctor said that she would need to take it easy for several weeks and that she must have someone to take care of the baby. Unfortunately, Samantha did not have anyone who could help her. (Samantha’s mother, who works full time, was unable to do so.)</p>
<p id="03807da6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The next few weeks were almost a total disaster for Samantha. The baby seemed to cry nonstop. Samantha couldn’t sleep at night and was constantly exhausted during the day. Samantha lost weight. The baby wouldn’t eat properly and hardly gained any weight at all. About a month after the baby was born, a Mrs. Wallace, who said she was from the welfare department, came with Samantha’s mother to visit her. Her mother said that Mrs. Wallace had come to take care of the baby because Samantha couldn’t do so and the baby was getting sick. Samantha agreed she needed help. Mrs. Wallace told Samantha that Samantha needed to sign a paper to allow Mrs. Wallace to take care of the baby, which Samantha did. Mrs. Wallace left, taking DeAnna with her.</p>
<p id="03807da7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A few weeks of rest did wonders for Samantha. When she felt better, she told her mother that she was going to see DeAnna. On the paper that Mrs. Wallace left with her was the name of an agency where she was able to reach Mrs. Wallace on the telephone. When Samantha said that she would like to visit DeAnna, Mrs. Wallace said that was not possible because once a baby was placed for adoption, the natural mother was not allowed to visit the baby. Samantha cried out that she had not given her baby for adoption. Mrs. Wallace explained that the paper she signed gave up her parental rights and authorized the agency to place the baby for adoption. Confused, Samantha turned to her mother, who said that she had contacted the agency because Samantha was too young to have a child, that she couldn’t take care of the baby, and that being a single mother would ruin her life. Samantha said she wanted her baby back, that she could take care of her. Her mother asked her to wait, and think about it for a while.</p>
<p id="03807da8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="715" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-715">p. 715</span>That was about six months ago. Samantha says she didn’t do anything about the baby during that time. For a while she didn’t know what to do. Then she returned to high school and found a part-time job that took up a lot of her time. Now she really wants the baby back, she says. She wants to know whether you can help her regain custody of DeAnna.</p>
<p id="03807da9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At this point, of course, you as an attorney could not yet give an opinion; fact investigation and legal research would be necessary before doing so. Suppose you begin by contacting Mrs. Wallace; she gives you a copy of the paper that Samantha signed, which is entitled “Consent to Adoption.” The document states that by signing the paper the mother is authorizing the agency to place the child for adoption and that the mother is releasing all parental rights, including any right to visit the child or know the name of the parents. Mrs. Wallace tells you that she explained the adoption to Samantha, who fully understood what she was doing. Mrs. Wallace says that it is not unusual for the mother in such cases to change her mind later. She also informs you that the adoptive parents have begun judicial proceedings, as required by local law, to adopt DeAnna legally.</p>
<p id="03807daa-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You then research the state statute governing adoption by consent. Its provisions include the following:</p>

Elaine tells the lawyer that her mother has started to engage in behavior that Elaine finds strange and financially risky. Recently, her mother has started to go on “buying sprees” in which she spends literally thousands of dollars acquiring new clothes, jewelry, shoes, etc. She has talked with her mother about the situation, and her mother says that sometimes she gets very depressed and lonely, and going shopping makes her feel better. She realizes that she doesn’t need a lot of the items that she is buying, but that doesn’t seem to stop her behavior. Elaine states that other than the overspending her mother seems perfectly normal. A recent doctor visit resulted in a diagnosis of bi-polar disorder which causes Natalie to be unable to make rational decisions at times. Many of the items that Natalie has purchased are unused. In addition, most of the items were purchased from a large department store, Northrop’s. Elaine has talked with the store about return of the items, but they have refused to take them back because the return dates in the sales slips have passed.

This fact was vaguely recognized in the common law doctrine of intrinsic fraud, that is, fraud which can be presumed from the grossly unfair nature of the terms of the contract.

In Quicken Loans, Inc. v. Brown, 230 W.Va. 306, 737 S.E.2d 640, 656–59 (2012) (“<i>Quicken Loans I</i>”), the court was presented with evidence that a loan was based on an inflated appraisal. But the loan also contained significant fees, a particularly high interest rate, and an undisclosed balloon payment. <i>See id.</i> So when the court found the loan to be unconscionable because its “total cost . . . was exorbitant,” its holding turned on much more than the principal amount of the loan. <i>See id.</i> at 659. And in Herrod v. First Republic Mortgage Corp., 218 W.Va. 611, 625 S.E.2d 373, 379–81 (2005), although the court reversed summary judgment where it found evidence that the “house was worth at least $20,000 less than the amount for which it was mortgaged,” its analysis concentrated singularly upon issues of fact relating to <i>procedural</i> unconscionability—namely, whether the loan was based on a fraudulent appraisal—and the decision never mentions substantive unconscionability. <i>See id.</i></p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="037d7141-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN1139A_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" id="note-N1139A_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">3</a></span>&nbsp;McFarland is joined in this argument by amici curiae The National Consumer Law Center, AARP, The National Association of Consumer Advocates, and The Center for Responsible Lending.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="037d9754-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN113B4_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" id="note-N113B4_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">4</a></span>&nbsp;McFarland contends that today this risk is more illusory than real, given that mortgage lenders can sell their loans on the secondary market and remove them from their balance sheets. But as the Banks explain, they remain accountable to the purchasers of their loans, and in some circumstances even may have to repurchase loans that prove “defective.” And indeed, many banks experienced a solvency crisis during the recent economic downturn because of the number of “bad loans” they had issued. . . . </p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="037d9756-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN113D5_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" id="note-N113D5_2c3aa387-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">5</a></span>&nbsp;Like the district court, we acknowledge that some federal courts in West Virginia appear to have reached a different conclusion, holding or assuming, without significant analysis, that a mortgage’s size may be evidence of substantive unconscionability. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Petty v.

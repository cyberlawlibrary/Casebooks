<p id="038a41d7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many of the various defenses surveyed in Chapter 7 have a common basis in the asserted misconduct of one party — misconduct resulting in the bargain being either surprisingly different from what the other party believed it to be or oppressively unfair to that party (perhaps both). Although suggestions of such misconduct may also be found in some of the cases in this chapter, the kinds of excuses from performance here at issue are those arising not from overreaching or deception by either party, but from changes in circumstance that have either occurred or come to light since the original agreement was made.</p>
<p id="038a41d8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is clear from our study thus far that executory contracts are frequently entered into for the purpose of protecting against various risks. Indeed, an insurance contract has (at least for the insured party) no other purpose. Even contracts that have as their main purpose the definition of some mutually beneficial exchange of performances (the sale of goods for money, for instance) may have as a subsidiary function the protection of one or both parties against the risk that certain unfavorable events may occur before the time when performance is to take place (a rise in the market price of the goods, for instance, which in the absence of an existing fixed-price contract would require the buyer to pay more than the presently available price, or a fall in the market, which could similarly force the seller to sell his goods at less profit, or even at a loss). In light of this risk-shifting function that contracts perform, it would not be surprising to find contract law generally resistant to the suggestion that a contractual obligation might be avoided just because unforeseen or unprovided-for circumstances made it less favorable to one of the parties than had been originally contemplated. And indeed it is resistant to such excuses, as we shall see. Nevertheless, there are a variety of established legal categories that hold out the possibility of such an excuse from performance, in appropriate cases.</p>

<p id="038a41dc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Like most words, <i>mistake</i> can be used to describe a variety of things. It may refer simply to a decision that with hindsight turns out to have been clearly wrong. (It was a mistake, for instance, for Napoleon to invade Russia; it was a mistake to have that fourth piece of pizza at bedtime.) Or it may describe a decision that, although not clearly disastrous, has nevertheless turned out to be at least arguably not the best choice that could have been made. Even if not always “20/20,” as popular wisdom would have it, hindsight is at least apt to be clearer than foresight, and many a contracting party has later regretted her choice to enter into a particular deal, wishing that she had insisted on better terms, expressly protected herself against some contingency, or even forgone the deal entirely.</p>
<p id="038a41dd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have seen already that contract law sometimes has to deal with the parties’ mistaken belief that they were using language with the same intention when in fact they attached different meanings to the terms they employed (recall the <i>Frigaliment</i> case in Chapter 5). Occasionally such a misunderstanding will cause the court to hold that no binding contract exists, although as we have seen the more usual judicial response is to choose one of the intended meanings and apply it in enforcing the contract. Should the law permit one party to escape a contractual obligation merely because she later regrets the deal she has made — views it, in effect, as a mistake? Ordinarily, the answer would be “No,” for the reason suggested in the introduction to this chapter: Parties make contracts with the aim of binding each other <i>despite</i> the myriad changes of circumstance that may occur before the time for performance arrives. Sometimes, however, the court finds that a more particular type of mistake has been made, which lifts the case above the ordinary run. The materials that follow explore various situations in which this extraordinary type of relief has been sought and, sometimes, awarded.</p>

<p id="038a68f4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In March of 1977, Carl and Nancy Pickles, appellees, purchased from appellants, William and Martha Messerly, a 600-square-foot tract of land upon <span title="721" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-721">p. 721</span>which is located a three-unit apartment building.

<p id="038a68f7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The facts of the case are not seriously in dispute. In 1971, the Messerlys acquired approximately one acre plus 600 square feet of land. A three-unit apartment building was situated upon the 600-square-foot portion. The trial court found that, prior to this transfer, the Messerlys’ predecessor in title, Mr. Bloom, had installed a septic tank on the property without a permit and in violation of the applicable health code. The Messerlys used the building as an income investment property until 1973 when they sold it, upon land contract, to James Barnes who likewise used it primarily as an income-producing investment.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10080_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10080_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">1</a></span></p>
<p id="038a68f9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. and Mrs. Barnes, with the permission of the Messerlys, sold approximately one acre of the property in 1976, and the remaining 600 square feet and building were offered for sale soon thereafter when Mr. and Mrs. Barnes defaulted on their land contract. Mr. and Mrs. Pickles evidenced an interest in the property, but were dissatisfied with the terms of the Barnes-Messerly land contract. Consequently, to accommodate the Pickleses’ preference to enter into a land contract directly with the Messerlys, Mr. and Mrs. Barnes executed a quit-claim deed which conveyed their interest in the property back to the Messerlys. After inspecting the property, Mr. and Mrs. Pickles executed a new land contract with the Messerlys on March 21, 1977. It provided for a purchase price of $25,500. A clause was added to the end of the land contract form which provides:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="038a68fa-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">17. Purchaser has examined this property and agrees to accept same in its present condition. There are no other or additional written or oral understandings.</p>
</div>
<p id="038a68fb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Five or six days later, when the Pickleses went to introduce themselves to the tenants, they discovered raw sewage seeping out of the ground. Tests conducted by a sanitation expert indicated the inadequacy of the sewage system. The Lenawee County Board of Health subsequently condemned the property and initiated this lawsuit in the Lenawee Circuit Court against the Messerlys as land contract vendors, and the Pickleses, as vendees, to obtain a permanent injunction proscribing human habitation of the premises until the property was brought into conformance with the Lenawee County sanitation code. The <span title="722" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-722">p. 722</span>injunction was granted, and the Lenawee County Board of Health was permitted to withdraw from the lawsuit by stipulation of the parties.</p>
<p id="038a900c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When no payments were made on the land contract, the Messerlys filed a cross-complaint against the Pickleses seeking foreclosure, sale of the property, and a deficiency judgment. Mr. and Mrs. Pickles then counterclaimed for rescission against the Messerlys, and filed a third-party complaint against the Barneses, which incorporated, by reference, the allegations of the counterclaim against the Messerlys. In count one, Mr. and Mrs. Pickles alleged failure of consideration. Count two charged Mr. and Mrs. Barnes with willful concealment and misrepresentation as a result of their failure to disclose the condition of the sanitation system. Additionally, Mr. and Mrs. Pickles sought to hold the Messerlys liable in equity for the Barneses’ alleged misrepresentation. The Pickleses prayed that the land contract be rescinded.</p>
<p id="038a900d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After a bench trial, the court concluded that the Pickleses had no cause of action against either the Messerlys or the Barneses as there was no fraud or misrepresentation. This ruling was predicated on the trial judge’s conclusion that none of the parties knew of Mr. Bloom’s earlier transgression or of the resultant problem with the septic system until it was discovered by the Pickleses, and that the sanitation problem was not caused by any of the parties. The trial court held that the property was purchased “as is,” after inspection and, accordingly, its “negative . . . value cannot be blamed upon an innocent seller.” Foreclosure was ordered against the Pickleses, together with a judgment against them in the amount of $25,943.09.</p>
<p id="038a900e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. and Mrs. Pickles appealed from the adverse judgment. The Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed the trial court’s ruling with respect to Mr. and Mrs. Barnes but, in a two-to-one decision, reversed the finding of no cause of action on the Pickleses’ claims against the Messerlys. Lenawee County Board of Health v. Messerly, 98 Mich. App. 478, 295 N.W.2d 903 (1980). It concluded that the mutual mistake between the Messerlys and the Pickleses went to a basic, as opposed to a collateral, element of the contract,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100A2_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N100A2_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">6</a></span> and that the parties intended to transfer income-producing rental property but, in actuality, the vendees paid $25,500 for an asset without value.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100A8_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N100A8_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">7</a></span></p>

The erroneous belief of one or both of the parties must relate to a fact in existence at the time the contract is executed. Richardson Lumber Co. v. Hoey, 219 Mich. 643, 189 N.W. 923 (1922); Sherwood v. Walker, 66 Mich. 568, 580, 33 N.W. 919 (1887) (Sherwood, J., dissenting). That is to say, the belief which is found to be in error may not be, in substance, a prediction as to a future occurrence or non-occurrence. . . . </p>
<p id="038a9015-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeals concluded, after a de novo review of the record, that the parties were mistaken as to the income-producing capacity of the property in question. 98 Mich. App. 487-488, 295 N.W.2d 903. We agree. The vendors and the vendees each believed that the property transferred could be utilized as income-generating rental property. All of the parties subsequently learned that, in fact, the property was unsuitable for any residential use.</p>
<p id="038a9016-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants assert that there was no mistake in the contractual sense because the defect in the sewage system did not arise until after the contract was executed. The appellees respond that the Messerlys are confusing the date of the inception of the defect with the date upon which the defect was discovered.</p>
<p id="038a9017-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is essentially a factual dispute which the trial court failed to resolve directly. Nevertheless, we are empowered to draw factual inferences from the facts found by the trial court. GCR 1963, 865.1(6).</p>
<p id="038a9018-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An examination of the record reveals that the septic system was defective prior to the date on which the land contract was executed. The Messerlys’ grantor installed a nonconforming septic system without a permit prior to the transfer of the property to the Messerlys in 1971. Moreover, virtually undisputed testimony indicates that, assuming ideal soil conditions, 2,500 square feet of property is necessary to support a sewage system adequate to serve a three-family dwelling. Likewise, 750 square feet is mandated for a one-family home. Thus, the division of the parcel and sale of one acre of the property by Mr. and Mrs. Barnes in 1976 made it impossible to remedy the already illegal septic system within the confines of the 600-square-foot parcel.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100D0_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N100D0_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">10</a></span></p>

<p id="038ab72b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having determined that when these parties entered into the land contract they were laboring under a mutual mistake of fact, we now direct our attention to a determination of the legal significance of that finding.</p>
<p id="038ab72c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A contract may be rescinded because of a mutual misapprehension of the parties, but this remedy is granted only in the sound discretion of the court. Harris v. Axline, 323 Mich. 585, 36 N.W.2d 154 (1949).

Miller, 354 Mich. 681, 94 N.W.2d 197 (1959).</p>
<p id="038ab72d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In that case, the plaintiff was the purchaser of 91 lots of real property. It sought partial rescission of the land contract when it was frustrated in its attempts to develop 42 of the lots because it could not obtain permits from the county health department to install septic tanks on these lots. This Court refused to allow rescission because the mistake, whether mutual or unilateral, related only to the value of the property.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="038ab72e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There was here no mistake as to the form or substance of the contract between the parties, or the description of the property constituting the subject matter. The situation involved is not at all analogous to that presented in Scott v. Grow, 301 Mich. 226; 3 N.W.2d 254; 141 A.L.R. 819 (1942). There the plaintiff sought relief by way of reformation of a deed on the ground that the instrument of conveyance had not been drawn in accordance with the intention and agreement of the parties. It was held that the bill of complaint stated a case for the granting of equitable relief by way of reformation. In the case at bar plaintiff received the property for which it contracted. The fact that it may be of less value than the purchaser expected at the time of the transaction is not a sufficient basis for the granting of equitable relief, neither fraud nor reliance on misrepresentation of material facts having been established.</p>

<p id="038ab730-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellees contend, on the other hand, that in this case the parties were mistaken as to the very nature of the character of the consideration and claim that the pervasive and essential quality of this mistake renders rescission appropriate. They cite in support of that view Sherwood v. Walker, 66 Mich. 568, 33 N.W. 919 (1887), the famous “barren cow” case. In that case, the parties agreed to the sale and purchase of a cow which was thought to be barren, but which was, in reality, with calf. When the seller discovered the fertile condition of his cow, he refused to deliver her. In permitting rescission, the Court stated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="038ab731-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It seems to me, however, in the case made by this record, that the mistake or misapprehension of the parties went to the whole substance of the agreement. If the cow was a breeder, she was worth at least $750; if barren, she was worth not over $80. The parties would not have made the contract of sale except upon the understanding and belief that she was incapable of breeding, and of no use as a cow. It is true she is now the identical animal that they thought her to be when the contract was made; there is no mistake as to the identity of the creature. Yet the mistake was not of the mere quality of the animal, but went to the very nature of the thing. A barren cow is substantially a different creature than a breeding one. There is as much difference between them for all purposes of use as there is between an ox and a cow that is capable of breeding and giving milk. If the mutual mistake had simply related to the fact whether she was with calf or not for one season, then it might have been a good sale; but the mistake affected the character of the animal for all time, and for her present and <span title="725" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-725">p. 725</span>ultimate use. She was not in fact the animal, or the kind of animal, the defendants intended to sell or the plaintiff to buy. She was not a barren cow, and, if this fact had been known, there would have been no contract. The mistake affected the substance of the whole consideration, and it must be considered that there was no contract to sell or sale of the cow as she actually was. The thing sold and bought had in fact no existence. She was sold as a beef-creature would be sold; she is in fact a breeding cow, and a valuable one.</p>
<p id="038ab732-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court should have instructed the jury that if they found that the cow was sold, or contracted to be sold, upon the understanding of both parties that she was barren, and useless for the purpose of breeding, and that in fact she was not barren, but capable of breeding, then the defendants had a right to rescind, and to refuse to deliver, and the verdict should be in their favor.</p>

<p id="038ab734-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the parties suggest, the foregoing precedent arguably distinguishes mistakes affecting the essence of the consideration from those which go to its quality or value, affording relief on a per se basis for the former but not the latter. See, e.g., Lenawee County Board of Health v. Messerly, 98 Mich. App. 478, 492, 295 N.W.2d 903 (1980) (Mackenzie, J., concurring in part).</p>
<p id="038ab735-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, the distinctions which may be drawn from <i>Sherwood</i> and <i>A &amp; M Land Development Co.</i> do not provide a satisfactory analysis of the nature of a mistake sufficient to invalidate a contract. Often, a mistake relates to an underlying factual assumption which, when discovered, directly affects value, but simultaneously and materially affects the essence of the contractual consideration. It is disingenuous to label such a mistake collateral. McKay v. Coleman, 85 Mich. 60, 48 N.W. 203 (1891). Corbin, Contracts (one vol. ed.), §605, p. 551.</p>
<p id="038ab736-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant and appellee both mistakenly believed that the property which was the subject of their land contract would generate income as rental property. The fact that it could not be used for human habitation deprived the property of its income-earning potential and rendered it less valuable. However, this mistake, while directly and dramatically affecting the property’s value, cannot accurately be characterized as collateral because it also affects the very essence of the consideration. “The thing sold and bought [income generating rental property] had in fact no existence.” Sherwood v. Walker, 66 Mich. 578, 33 N.W. 919.</p>
<p id="038ab737-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We find that the inexact and confusing distinction between contractual mistakes running to value and those touching the substance of the consideration serves only as an impediment to a clear and helpful analysis for the equitable resolution of cases in which mistake is alleged and proven. Accordingly, the holdings of <i>A &amp; M Land Development Co.</i> and <i>Sherwood</i> with respect to the material or collateral nature of a mistake are limited to the facts of those cases.</p>

<p id="038ade53-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All of the parties to this contract erroneously assumed that the property transferred by the vendors to the vendees was suitable for human habitation and could be utilized to generate rental income. The fundamental nature of these assumptions is indicated by the fact that their invalidity changed the character of the property transferred, thereby frustrating, indeed precluding, Mr. and Mrs. Pickles’ intended use of the real estate. Although the Pickleses are disadvantaged by enforcement of the contract, performance is advantageous to the Messerlys, as the property at issue is less valuable absent its income-earning potential. Nothing short of rescission can remedy the mistake. Thus, the parties’ mistake as to a basic assumption materially affects the agreed performances of the parties.</p>
<p id="038ade54-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite the significance of the mistake made by the parties, we reverse the Court of Appeals because we conclude that equity does not justify the remedy sought by Mr. and Mrs. Pickles.</p>

We are guided to that conclusion, in part, by the standards announced in §154 of the Restatement of Contracts 2d, for determining when a party bears the risk of mistake. See footnote 12. Section 154(a) suggests that the court should look first to whether the parties have agreed to the allocation of the risk between themselves. While there is no express assumption in the contract by either party of the risk of the property becoming uninhabitable, there was indeed some agreed allocation of the risk to the vendees by the incorporation of an “as is” clause into the contract which, we repeat, provided:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="038b0569-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Purchaser has examined this property and agrees to accept same in its present condition. There are no other or additional written or oral understandings.</p>
</div>
<p id="038b056a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That is a persuasive indication that the parties considered that, as between them, such risk as related to the “present condition” of the property should lie with the purchaser. If the “as is” clause is to have any meaning at all, it must be interpreted to refer to those defects which were unknown at the time that the contract was executed. Thus, the parties themselves assigned the risk of loss to Mr. and Mrs. Pickles.</p>

<li class=""><p id="038b0571-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Factual Context.</i> Additional facts in the <i>Lenawee</i> case can be found in the intermediate appellate court opinion. Testimony at trial established that when the Messerlys initially purchased the property in June 1971, Bloom, the previous owner, made an affirmative statement that there had never been a problem with the sanitation system. Bloom failed to disclose, however, that he had replaced the prior septic tank with a relatively small 500-gallon septic tank and had failed to obtain a required permit from the county agency. Lenawee County Board of Health v. Messerly, 295 N.W.2d 903, 904 (Mich. Ct. App. 1980). County health officials testified that the five-bedroom property did not have the minimum of 2,000 square feet for a drain field that would be needed for a normal septic system and that two septic tanks of at least 1,000 <span title="728" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-728">p. 728</span>gallons would be needed for a costly “pump and haul” system. 295 N.W.2d at 907. The Messerlys never lived at the property, rarely visited there, had the septic tank cleaned once without incident, and never received any complaints or noticed any problems. Prior to executing the land contract, Mr. Pickles did ask the Barneses about the septic tank. Mr. and Mrs. Barnes responded that they had lived in an apartment for three months in early 1974, had visited the property only occasionally after that, had the septic tank cleaned once without notice of irregularity other than some odor in one bathroom, and received no complaints from tenants. 295 N.W.2d at 905, n.3. Do these additional facts affect your impression of the case?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="038b0572-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Lack of consistency in mutual mistake cases.</i> In Gartner v. Eikill, 319 N.W.2d 397 (Minn. 1982), a purchaser of land sought rescission on the ground of mutual mistake, claiming that unknown to him the land had in the past been subjected to a special zoning restriction making it unuseable for the purpose for which he had purchased it. The contract of purchase stated that the seller would convey marketable title subject to, inter alia, “Building and zoning laws, ordinances, State and Federal regulations. . . .” Neither party at the time of the sale was aware of the restriction. Relying on prior Minnesota cases as well as Sherwood v. Walker (discussed in the principal case), the court in <i>Gartner</i> allowed rescission on the basis of “mutual mistake of fact.” <i>Gartner</i> and <i>Lenawee</i> obviously reach opposing outcomes; are they necessarily inconsistent decisions? Can they be harmonized so that both cases may be regarded as rightly decided? Or was one of them wrongly decided? Is it possible that <i>both</i> were wrongly decided? Additional examples of cases with similar facts reaching apparently contrary results in this area can be found: Compare Nichols v. City of Evansdale, 687 N.W.2d 562 (Iowa 2004) (rescission would be available to both parties where neither knew that sewer lines ran beneath transferred property and the error had a material effect on the agreed exchange), with Maloney v. Sargisson, 465 N.E.2d 296 (Mass. App. Ct. 1984) (rescission denied where purchasers discovered that concrete drain line ran under street fronting their land, precluding building because it made installation of septic tank impossible).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="038b0573-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Limiting earlier court decisions.</i> In analyzing the character of the “mistake” made by the buyers in <i>Lenawee,</i> the Michigan Supreme Court discusses and quotes at length from two earlier Michigan decisions, A &amp; M Land Development Co. v. Miller and the “famous ‘barren cow’ case,” Sherwood v. Walker. The <i>Lenawee</i> court does not expressly overrule either <i>Sherwood</i> or <i>A &amp; M Land Development Co.,</i> but it limits the holding of each to its facts, effectively destroying their value as precedent, at least in Michigan. Why did the court so hold? Is the mode of analysis applied by the court in <i>Lenawee</i> preferable to that employed in those cases?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="038b0574-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Effect of “as is” clause.</i> Like the Michigan Supreme Court in <i>Lenawee,</i> a number of other courts have denied relief on mutual mistake and other grounds when the contract contained an “as is” or similar clause. See Thomas J. Duggan, LLC v. Peacock Point, LLC, 89 So. 3d 283 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2012) (denying rescission to buyer who claimed, among other theories, that parties <span title="729" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-729">p. 729</span>made a mutual mistake regarding whether property was ready for residential construction when property was sold “as is”); Firstmerit Bank, N.A. v. Vision Fin. Group, Inc., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70507 (W.D. Pa.) (denying claim by assignee to rescind assignment of equipment lease even though equipment did not exist because mistake was the result of misrepresentation by a third party and under language of assignment assignee bore risk of any mistake). There are other decisions, however, which deny such conclusive effect to “as is” provisions. See Shore Builders, Inc. v. Dogwood, Inc., 616 F. Supp. 1004 (D. Del. 1985) (since mutual mistake arises in situations beyond contemplation of contracting parties, all-purpose boilerplate “as is” clauses should be regarded as ineffective because parties lack adequate notice of what is being bargained for); Lesher v. Strid, 996 P.2d 988 (Or. Ct. App. 2000) (claim of mutual mistake not barred by “as is” clause where seller’s representation of water rights was incorporated into contract for sale of land).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="038b2c85-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Conscious ignorance.</i> Another form of assumption of risk is based on a party’s conscious ignorance of all relevant facts before entering an agreement, as suggested by the Restatement (Second) of Contracts §154(b) quoted in <i>Lenawee.</i> An example is Estate of Nelson v. Rice, 12 P.3d 238 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2000), in which the representatives of an estate sold two paintings for $60 without having them appraised by an appropriate expert and the paintings later proved to be worth more than $1 million. Relying on §154(b), the court rejected the estate’s claim of mutual mistake because the representatives were aware of the possibility that the estate might include fine art but failed to employ a qualified expert before making the sale. See also Land Baron Inv. v. Bonnie Springs Family LP, 356 P.3d 511 (Nev. 2015) (experienced developer assumed risk of conscious uncertainty in making contract to purchase property for $17 million without verifying that access roads could be built or water rights obtained for anticipated residential subdivision; summary judgment denying rescission for mutual mistake affirmed).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="038b2c86-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Mistake in written expression</i>. When the mutual mistake consists of the failure of the written contract to state accurately the actual agreement of the parties, reformation of the contract to express the parties’ mutual intent is the normal remedy. Compare United Bank v. Ashland Development Corp., 792 P.2d 775 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1990) (property line descriptions in deeds reformed for mutual mistake), with R &amp; B Farms, Inc. v. Cedar Valley Acres, Inc., 798 N.W.2d 121 (Neb. 2011) (denying reformation because record did not contain clear and convincing evidence that description in agreement was the result of mutual mistake).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="038b2c87-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Equitable relief.</i> The relief available for mutual mistake other than a mistake in the writing is ordinarily rescission, along with any restitution that may appear appropriate. E.g., O’Connor v. Harger Constr., Inc., 188 P.3d 846 (Idaho 2008) (rescission granted when parties were mutually mistaken that access to property could be granted by easement through private driveway; contractor ordered to make restitution of buyer’s deposit less the value of building materials in buyer’s possession). As relief for mutual mistake is an equitable remedy, traditionally an area of greater judicial discretion, courts occasionally exercise <span title="730" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-730">p. 730</span>creative ingenuity in fashioning a remedy to fit the nature of the mistake. For example, in Donohue v. Picinich, 852 F. Supp. 144 (D. Conn. 1994), both parties to a land purchase contract were mistaken about something — the buyers thought they were getting a tract of land including a pond, although the pond was really on an adjoining lot not intended by the seller to be included in their purchase; on the other hand, the seller’s attorney had mistakenly drafted the contract to include all of that additional lot, and both parties had signed it. The court reformed the contract so as to give the purchasers the pond on the adjoining tract, but leaving the rest of that tract as the property of the seller.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="038b2c88-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Personal injury settlement cases.</i> Claims of mutual mistake are also frequently made by litigants seeking to overturn releases or settlement agreements. A common fact pattern involves settlement of a personal injury claim that the plaintiff later regrets because the injuries turn out to be worse than they were thought to be at the time of the settlement. Such cases involve tension between the social policies of finality of litigation and fair compensation for injury. Not surprisingly, courts differ in the degree to which they will allow such releases to be set aside. Compare Kendrick v. Barker, 15 P.3d 734 (Wyo. 2001) (rescission based on mutual mistake not available to injured party who settled claim with knowledge that extent of closed head injury was uncertain and with assistance of counsel), with Gibli v. Kadosh, 717 N.Y.S.2d 553 (App. Div. 2000) (to “avoid grave injustice,” relief for mutual mistake would be available if plaintiff could demonstrate that injury was of different nature than both parties believed it to be at the time of release).</p></li>

<p id="038b2c91-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">BMW Financial Services NA, LLC (BMW Financial) appeals from an order granting a motion to compel acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment entered in favor of Frank Deloach. BMW Financial obtained a large default judgment against Deloach relating to a leased car that had been repossessed with an altered odometer. Owing to BMW Financial’s mistake in sending the Deloach account to a collection agency, the agency and Deloach’s father settled the matter for considerably less than the amount of the default judgment. BMW Financial tried to rescind the settlement, but Deloach filed a motion for satisfaction of judgment, which the trial court granted.</p>
<p id="038b53a2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We affirm the order. BMW Financial did not qualify for rescission of the settlement agreement based on mistake. Substantial evidence supported the trial court’s determination that BMW Financial bore the risk of the mistake and that enforcing the settlement agreement would not be unconscionable.</p>

<p id="038b53a3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>FACTS</b></p>
<p id="038b53a4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The facts are not disputed. Deloach leased a 2013 BMW from Shelly BMW in Buena Park.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10263_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10263_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">1</a></span> At the time of the lease, the BMW’s odometer displayed 4,293 miles. Deloach did not make his payments, and the car was repossessed. At that time, the odometer displayed 94 miles, and inspection revealed that the odometer had been tampered with, in violation of state and federal laws.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10269_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10269_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">2</a></span></p>
<p id="038b53a7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">BMW Financial sued Deloach for breaching the lease and for tampering with the odometer. He did not respond, and BMW Financial took his default on April 20, 2015. The BMW was sold at auction for $25,000. Because of the odometer tampering, the vehicle had to be sold with a TMU (true mileage unknown) designation, which impaired its value.</p>
<p id="038b53a8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The account was sent to a collection agency, Firstsource Advantage, LLC. Firstsource contacted Deloach in August 2015 to collect the balance of the account, which, according to the information sent to the agency, stood at approximately $24,000. At this point, David Deloach, Deloach’s father, became involved. David Deloach negotiated a settlement with Firstsource for a complete release in exchange for $14,000. Firstsource confirmed the settlement in writing on August 17, 2015, and thereafter confirmed, not only the receipt of the $14,000, but also “that our client has agreed to accept less than the full balance due as settlement on the above mentioned account.”</p>
<p id="038b53a9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On August 13, 2015, the trial court entered a default judgment in favor of BMW Financial and against Deloach for $114,677. Most of the judgment, $81,296, was for treble damages for the odometer tampering. (See 49 U.S.C. §32710, subd. (a).) Counsel for BMW Financial contacted Deloach on September 15, 2015, asserting that the August settlement was entered into by mistake and purporting to rescind it by returning the $14,000. Deloach countered with a motion to compel acknowledgement of satisfaction of judgment.</p>
<p id="038b53aa-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">BMW Financial opposed the motion on grounds of mistake. A company representative explained how the mistake occurred. After the BMW was sold at auction, the purchase price was posted to Deloach’s account. If the balance on an account exceeds $5,500, it is turned over to a collection agency. If the account is in litigation, however, it is not given to a collection agency. The error occurred because Deloach’s account was not flagged as being involved in litigation. It was therefore mistakenly sent to Firstsource for collection.</p>
<p id="038b53ab-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to the information sent to Firstsource, the balance on Deloach’s account was $24,442. Firstsource sent a letter dated August 10, 2015, to Deloach informing him of the balance and urging him to contact it, as he <span title="732" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-732">p. 732</span>“may be eligible for payment options that were not available to you before.” David Deloach sent an email to Firstsource dated August 17 requesting confirmation of an agreement that Firstsource would accept $14,000 in full settlement of the debt and cause BMW Financial to execute a dismissal with prejudice or satisfaction of judgment. Firstsource responded on the same day, in writing, stating “Upon receipt and clearance of your payment as agreed, we will notify our client to update its records accordingly regarding this settlement.” The next day, Firstsource sent Deloach a letter stating, “This letter serves as confirmation that our client has agreed to accept less than the full balance due as settlement on the above mentioned account.” Firstsource had a preauthorized settlement authority range, and the ultimate settlement of $14,000 was within that range.</p>
<p id="038b53ac-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court issued the default judgment for $118,296 on August 13, but BMW Financial did not learn about it until after the settlement had been concluded.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10288_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10288_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">3.</a></span> It appears that BMW Financial found out about the mistake in mid-September when one of the Deloaches called its counsel about the settlement agreement.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1028E_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1028E_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">4.</a></span> BMW Financial’s counsel sent Deloach a letter dated September 15 repudiating the settlement.</p>
<p id="038b53af-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court granted Deloach’s motion to compel satisfaction of judgment after an unreported hearing on November 23, 2015. It awarded him $2,455 in costs and the statutory penalty of $100. The court ordered Deloach’s counsel to prepare a satisfaction of judgment order for its signature. The order was entered on December 21, 2015.</p>
<p id="038b53b0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Evidently BMW Financial’s counsel submitted proposed orders to the court, only one of which is in the record, purporting to give details of what happened at the hearing. This effort prompted the judge to issue what was in effect a statement of decision on January 7, 2016, explaining his reasoning. The court determined that BMW Financial’s “authorized representative made exactly the deal that he wanted to make. He acted within the scope of his negotiating authority and followed those instructions precisely and without error.” The court concluded the deal was reasonable, given that settlement amounts are routinely less than the actual debt. The court also concluded that rescinding the settlement agreement would be unconscionable, because there was no evidence of sharp dealing by either Deloach or an overly harsh outcome. The court distinguished the case BMW Financial relied on, noting that the error in that case was made by someone unrelated to the party seeking rescission for mistake, while in this case BMW Financial itself made the error.</p>

<p id="038b7ac5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We first observe that the subject of this dispute is a settlement agreement, and not a commercial contract or a construction bid. Settlement agreements are highly favored under California law. (See, e.g.., City of Orange v. San Diego County Employees Retirement Assn. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 45, 55; . . . .) Although ordinary contract principles, including the availability of rescission for mistake (see, e.g., Harris v. Rudin, Richman &amp; Appel (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 1332), govern settlement agreements, the favored position of these agreements factors into the assessment of the unconscionability of enforcement.</p>

(Id. at pp. 268–269.) The dealer was unaware of the mistake until a customer came in with the advertisement and offered to buy the car for the incorrect price. (Id. at p. 269.) The customer was immediately told that the advertisement was a mistake by both the salesman to whom he made the offer and the sales manager. (Id. at p. 268.) Nevertheless, the customer sued the dealer for breach of contract, fraud, and negligence. (Ibid.)</p>
<p id="038b7ac8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Adopting the test set forth in the Restatement Second of Contracts, the court held that the following facts must be established to qualify for rescission based on mistake of fact: “(1) the defendant made a mistake regarding a basic assumption upon which the defendant made the contract; (2) the mistake has a material effect upon the agreed exchange of performances that is adverse to the defendant; (3) the defendant does not bear the risk of the mistake; and (4) the effect of the mistake is such that enforcement of the contract would be unconscionable.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN102CC_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N102CC_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">7</a></span> (<i>Donovan,</i> supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 282.)</p>

<p id="038ba1db-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>I. <span class="epub-small-caps">Allocation of Risk</span></b></p>
<p id="038ba1dc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Restatement Second of Contracts, section 154 states: “A party bears the risk of a mistake when [¶] (a) the risk is allocated to him by agreement of the parties, or [¶] (b) he is aware, at the time the contract is made, that he has only limited knowledge with respect to the facts to which the mistake relates but treats his limited knowledge as sufficient, or [¶] (c) the risk is allocated to him by the court on the ground that it is reasonable in the circumstances to do so.” The <i>Donovan</i> court held that the third alternative applied in that case. (<i>Donovan,</i> supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 283.)</p>
<p id="038ba1dd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court then observed that the risk of mistake must be allocated to a party when the mistake results from that party’s “neglect of a legal duty.” (<i>Donovan,</i> supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 283.) That is, it is reasonable under the circumstances to allocate the risk to the party who had neglected a legal duty. But what constitutes neglect of a legal duty? The <i>Donovan</i> case chiefly concentrates on what it is not. It is not, for instance, ordinary carelessness or negligence, but it could be extreme negligence. (Id. at pp. 283–284.) It is not necessarily the violation of a statute. (Id. at pp. 284–285.)</p>
<p id="038ba1de-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">BMW Financial argues that the risk of the mistake can be assigned to it only if it neglected a legal duty. Failing to tag the Deloach account as being in litigation was not neglect of a legal duty, so BMW Financial should not have to bear the risk.</p>
<p id="038ba1df-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Neglect of a legal duty is not, however, the only circumstance under which a court may allocate risk. The Restatement stresses reasonableness and observes that “the court will consider the purposes of the parties and will have recourse to its own general knowledge of human behavior in bargain transactions [.]” (Rest.2d Contracts, §154, com. d.) The illustrations bear out this observation.</p>
<p id="038ba1e0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of the Restatement illustrations to this section posits the sale of farmland that is later discovered to contain valuable mineral deposits unknown to both parties. “In some instances it is reasonably clear that a party should bear the risk of a mistake for reasons other than those stated in Subparagraphs (a) and (b). In such instances, under the rule stated in Subparagraph (c), the court will allocate the risk to that party on the ground that it is reasonable to do so. A court will generally do this, for example, where the seller of farm land seeks to avoid the contract of sale on the ground that valuable mineral rights have newly been found.” (Rest.2d Contracts, §154, com. d.) It would be hard to accuse the seller in this illustration of neglecting a legal duty in failing to <span title="735" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-735">p. 735</span>discover that the land contained valuable mineral deposits. Drawing on general knowledge of human behavior in bargain transactions, however, a court could reasonably allocate the risk to the seller on the ground that he was in a better position to know the composition of the property than the buyer was.</p>
<p id="038ba1e1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Likewise, in another illustration, a landowner and a builder make a contract about removing gravel from the property at a stated rate per cubic yard. Unbeknownst to both of them, part of the gravel is under water and is thus more expensive to remove. The court will allocate the risk to the builder, not because the builder has neglected a legal duty, but because it is reasonable under the circumstances to expect the builder to have looked over the property before entering into the contract. (Rest.2d Contracts, §154, com. d, illus. 4.)</p>
<p id="038ba1e2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, the trial court found it was reasonable under the circumstances to allocate the risk to BMW Financial, and substantial evidence supports this conclusion. The error was attributable solely to BMW Financial’s failure to tag Deloach’s account as being in litigation. BMW Financial presented no evidence that Firstsource or either Deloach knew about the default judgment when Firstsource and David Deloach entered into negotiations to settle the case. As the court noted, a crucial difference between the circumstances of this case and those of <i>Donovan</i> was that in <i>Donovan</i> an unrelated third party—a newspaper—had made the mistake by printing the wrong sale price of a car. (<i>Donovan,</i> supra, 26 Cal.4th at pp. 289–290 [“The uncontradicted evidence established that the [newspaper] made the proofreading error resulting in [the car dealer’s] mistake.”].) In this case, however, the mistake was BMW Financial’s and no one else’s.</p>
<p id="038ba1e3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is another significant difference between this case and <i>Donovan</i>. In <i>Donovan</i> the customer was immediately told when he produced the erroneous advertisement that the price was a mistake, and the sales manager offered to compensate the customer for his expenses. (Id. at p. 268.) In this case, BMW Financial waited nearly a month to inform Deloach that it wanted to rescind.</p>
<p id="038ba1e4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The hard fact is that someone has to bear the risk of the mistake. Should it be the person who negotiated a reasonable settlement for actual damages with the agent for the other party and received confirmation that the settlement was a done deal, only to be told a month later that the settlement was off? Or should it be the party whose error caused the problem and who is nevertheless coming out roughly even?</p>
<p id="038ba1e5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>II. <span class="epub-small-caps">Good Faith and Fair Dealing</span></b></p>
<p id="038bc8f6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Restatement also observes that “[e]ven though a mistaken party does not bear the risk of a mistake, he may be barred from avoidance if the mistake was the result of his failure to act in good faith and in accordance with reasonable standards of fair dealing.” (Rest.2d Contracts, §154, com. a.) It then cites to section 157 of the Restatement, which provides, “A mistaken party’s fault in failing to know or discover the facts before making the contract does not bar him from avoidance . . . under the rules stated in this Chapter, unless his fault amounts to a failure to act in good faith and in accordance with reasonable <span title="736" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-736">p. 736</span>standards of fair dealing.” (Rest.2d Contracts, §157.) BMW Financial argues that it acted with good faith and fair dealing, so it should be entitled to rescind.</p>
<p id="038bc8f7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although “a failure to act in good faith and in accordance with reasonable standards of fair dealing during pre-contractual negotiations does not amount to a breach[, [n]evertheless, under the rule stated in this Section, the failure bars a mistaken party from relief based on a mistake that otherwise would not have been made. During the negotiation stage each party is held to a degree of responsibility appropriate to the justifiable expectations of the other.” (Rest.2d Contracts, §157, com. a.)<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10335_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10335_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">8.</a></span></p>
<p id="038bc8f9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Good faith and reasonable standards of fair dealing in this context are not limited to an absence of cheating or of fraud. They include not disappointing the justifiable expectations of the other party. (See <i>Donovan,</i> supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 290.) Deloach was certainly justified in expecting that Firstsource could settle his debt with BMW Financial, especially after receiving a letter from Firstsource stating, “[O]ur client [i.e., BMW Financial] has agreed to accept less than the full balance due as settlement of the above mentioned account.” The recipient of this letter could reasonably infer that Firstsource had consulted BMW Financial as to this particular settlement and received its particular approval. BMW Financial therefore had another opportunity to discover that the account was in litigation. Moreover, there is no evidence that David Deloach was pressing Firstsource to settle immediately. There was time to check the records.</p>
<p id="038bc8fa-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>III. <span class="epub-small-caps">Unconscionability</span></b></p>
<p id="038bc8fb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In discussing unconscionability, the <i>Donovan</i> court focused on the difference between the correct price and the mistaken price. It discussed not only the loss the dealer would sustain by selling the disputed car at the mistaken price, but also other cases involving substantial differences between the two prices. The court concluded that forcing a sale at such a loss would be unconscionable. (<i>Donovan,</i> supra, 26 Cal.4th at pp. 292–293.)</p>
<p id="038bc8fc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, the trial court found that enforcing the settlement agreement would not be unconscionable, and once again substantial evidence supports this conclusion. BMW Financial received $39,000 for the leased BMW—$25,000 from its sale at auction and $14,000 from the settlement. The balance on the Deloach account when it was sent to Firstsource was $24,442. BMW Financial’s actual loss was a little over $10,000. On the plus side, as is so often true of settlements, BMW Financial had a $14,000 bird in the hand and did not have to spend money chasing after $24,000 it might never collect. Its recognition of this benefit is reflected in the fact that Firstsource was authorized to accept $14,000 to settle a $24,000 debt. As the court observed, “Judgements are routinely satisfied by a payment of less than its face amount, and the circumstances of this case made such a deal very likely.” An additional factor, as discussed above, is the favored position that settlements occupy in California law.</p>
<p id="038bc8fd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="737" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-737">p. 737</span>The large discrepancy between the amount of the settlement and the amount of the default judgment in this case was, for the most part, the penalty awarded for odometer tampering. BMW Financial considers this the final pivot point of the analysis of the case. At oral argument, its counsel was astonished that we did not realize we were dismantling the entire federal statutory scheme preventing odometer fraud if we did not consider the punitive damages award. This astonishment reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of punitive damages. This amount did not reflect an actual loss to BMW Financial, as was true of the cases cited in <i>Donovan</i>. (Cf. Conservatorship of O’Connor (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1076, 1098 [contract voidable for mistake only if enforcement more onerous to party seeking avoidance than would it would have been without mistake].) “The purpose of punitive damages is to punish wrongdoers and thereby deter the commission of wrongful acts.” (Neal v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1978) 21 Cal.3d 910, 928, fn. 13; . . . Civ. Code, §3345, subd. (b).) Penalties and punitive damage awards are not intended to compensate plaintiffs or make them whole. Moreover, the loss of this extra cash—assuming it was collectable from a person who could not make his car lease payments—may have the salutary effect of making BMW Financial more vigilant in its bookkeeping. We hope his escape in this case has a similarly salutary effect on the younger Deloach. A lifetime rarely includes two instances of such unconscionable luck.</p>

<li class=""><p id="038bf013-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>“Palpable” nature or unconscionable effect of mistake.</i> The <i>BMW Financial</i> court relied on a test for unilateral mistake based on the Restatement (Second) §153, quoted in footnote 7. It should be noted, however, that the Restatement (Second) and various courts have recognized a few different bases for unilateral mistake. Early cases granting relief required that the unilateral mistake be <i>“palpable”</i> — so obvious that the other party in the circumstances either knew or should have known that a mistake had been made. See Restatement (Second) §153(b). In such cases, the mistake is truly “unilateral” (i.e., the other party knows or has reason to know that there is a mistake). E.g., Belk v. Martin, 39 P.3d 592 (Idaho 2001) (lease agreement reformed on grounds of unilateral mistake where lessee knew that written lease amount should have been $14,768 instead of $1,476.80). Sometimes it is said that one party may not “snap up” an offer that is “too good to be true.” The court in <i>BMW Financial</i> concluded, however, that the Deloaches had no reason to know that BMW Financial had made a mistake when they agreed to settle the dispute. Cf. Sumerel v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 232 P.3d 128 (Colo. Ct. App. 2009) (alleged settlement agreement <span title="738" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-738">p. 738</span>for $2.7 million that included overpayment of $550,000 would be unenforceable due to obvious mistake by defendant’s counsel and inequitable conduct by plaintiffs’ attorneys in effort to gain windfall).</p>
<p id="038bf014-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>BMW Financial</i> court applied an alternative test for unilateral mistake, as stated in Restatement (Second) §153(a) and adopted in the earlier <i>Donovan</i> case, that focused largely on the <i>“unconscionable effect of mistake”</i> on the adversely affected party if the contract is enforced. This variation of the unilateral mistake excuse, of course, has additional requirements: The mistake must involve a basic assumption of the contract, it must have a material effect on the exchange, and the mistaken party must not bear the risk of the mistake. The court also considered the possibility of harm to the other party if excuse is granted. Although, as we have seen, “unconscionability” in the context of Restatement (Second) §208 or UCC §2-302 is a complex and somewhat amorphous concept, “unconscionable” in the context of §153(a) seems to mean merely severe enough to cause substantial loss. See the <i>Donovan</i> and <i>Wil-Fred’s</i> cases discussed in the following notes. The <i>BMW Financial</i> court held that the loss of more than $80,000 in punitive damages did not result in unconscionable harm to the plaintiff because it did not amount to an out-of-pocket loss, but instead was more in the nature of an unrealized gain of “extra cash.” In reaching its decision, the <i>BMW Financial</i> court also factored in the nature of the plaintiff’s mistake, the delay in discovering the mistake, and the defendant’s reasonable reliance on the collection agency’s authority to settle the dispute.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="038bf015-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Requirement that benefitting party cause or induce the mistake.</i> Apart from palpability and unconscionable effect, the Restatement (Second) §153(b) incorporates a third alternative basis for unilateral mistake when “the other party . . . caused the mistake.” Indeed, a few courts have gone further and held that the unilateral mistake <i>must be caused</i> by the other party to warrant relief. See, e.g., Environmental Servs., Inc. v. Hull Forest Prods., 2013 WL 1408629 (Conn. Super. Ct.) (claimant for rescission based on unilateral mistake must establish fraud or inequitable conduct by other party that caused mistake). Notably, a Florida District Appellate Court, on its third review of the same case, recently abandoned its interpretation that state law required inducement by the party seeking to benefit from the unilateral mistake. <i>DePrince v. Starboard Cruise Services,</i> 2018 WL 3636849 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App.). The <i>DePrince</i> case involved a contract made on a cruise ship by the onboard jewelry shop to sell a twenty carat diamond for $235,000 (the per carat price) when the total price should have been nearly $5 million. The mistake resulted entirely from messages between the ship sales staff and its mainland diamond supplier. Based on information from a knowledgeable family member, DePrince clearly had reason to know there was a mistake in the price. The more challenging question for the Florida courts, however, was whether DePrince could be deemed to have “induced” the mistake by merely failing to disclose the pricing error. The answer to that difficult question became irrelevant when the appellate court, after carefully reviewing precedent, concluded that inducement by the other party should not <span title="739" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-739">p. 739</span>be a required element of Florida law on unilateral mistake. The appellate court upheld the rescission of the sales contract.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="038bf016-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Mistake of fact vs. mistake of judgment.</i> In addressing claims of unilateral mistake, some courts granted relief for “clerical errors” or other “mistakes of fact,” but not for “mistakes in judgment.” What policy underlies this distinction? Many of the cases have indeed involved clerical, or “mechanical,” errors. See, e.g., First Baptist Church of Moultrie v. Barber Contracting Co., 377 S.E.2d 717 (Ga. Ct. App. 1989) (rescission granted when contractor made $118,776 error in adding cost of materials on its work sheets). See also Belk v. Martin, note 1 above. More recent cases have, like <i>BMW Financial,</i> been less disposed to focus on the fact-judgment distinction and more inclined to concentrate on the strength of the proof that a genuine and identifiable mistake was made as to a basic assumption of the contract. The Restatement does not use the fact-judgment distinction although it might be relevant to the question of “risk allocation.”</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="038bf017-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Effect of negligence.</i> Must a unilateral mistake be “non-negligent” in order to form a basis for relief? Relying on the <i>Donovan</i> case, the <i>BMW Financial</i> court clearly acknowledged that “ordinary carelessness or negligence” will not amount to the kind of neglect of a legal duty that will preclude relief for unilateral mistake. Thus, the courts tend to recognize there will often be a degree of negligence in a unilateral mistake case. See E. Allan Farnsworth, Contracts §9.3, at 613 (4th ed. 2004). In §157, the Restatement (Second) expressly negates any requirement that the mistaken party be non-negligent, requiring only that its conduct not fall below the level of good faith and fair dealing. But see ATS-1 Corp. v. Rodriguez, 67 N.Y.S.3d 60 (App. Div. 2017) (rescission not available when unilateral mistake resulted from negligence or failure to exercise ordinary care).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="038bf018-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Unilateral mistake in construction bidding cases.</i> A common situation in which claims of unilateral mistake may be raised are construction contracts in which a contractor claims to have made a mistake in submitting its bid. For example, in Wil-Fred’s, Inc. v. Metropolitan Sanitary Dist.<i>,</i> 372 N.E.2d 946 (Ill. App. Ct. 1978), the defendant Sanitary District solicited bids for rehabilitation work at one of its water reclamation plants. Wil-Fred’s submitted a bid and made a $100,000 deposit. The bidding documents stated that Wil-Fred’s certified that it had examined the contract documents, that it had made the examination and investigation necessary to submit its bid, that the bid could not be cancelled or withdrawn, and that the Sanitary District would retain a $100,000 deposit as liquidated damages if Wil-Fred’s failed to perform after being awarded the contract. However, Wil-Fred’s sought to avoid the contract on the ground that its bid price of $882,600 was based in material part on the bid of an excavating subcontractor who had made a $150,000 mistake in bidding based on a misunderstanding of the specifications. While recognizing the importance of maintaining the competitive bidding system, the court granted relief because the mistake related to a material part of the contract, Wil-Fred’s had exercised reasonable care (it had dealt with the subcontractor over a period of years without problem), the consequences of denial of relief would be great <span title="740" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-740">p. 740</span>because Wil-Fred’s forfeiture of the deposit would reduce its bonding capacity for other projects by two to three million dollars, and the Sanitary District had not changed its position in reliance on Wil-Fred’s bid and could be returned to status quo. Moreover, the court noted that the difference of $235,775 between Wil-Fred’s bid and the next lowest bid should have put the Sanitary District on notice that the bid contained a material mistake. But see Handle Constr. Co. v. Norcon, Inc., 264 P.3d 367 (Alaska 2011) (denying relief to subcontractor on theory of unilateral mistake because subcontractor who underbid by about $140,000 knew that it submitted its bid based on incomplete information and 35 percent differential with next lowest bid was insufficient to place contractor on notice of mistake).</p>
<p id="038bf019-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recall the <i>Baird</i> and <i>Drennan</i> cases in Chapter 3, involving the enforcement of subcontract bids after attempted revocation. On the basis of the principles illustrated in <i>Wil-Fred’s</i>, should the subcontractors in those cases have been able to obtain relief from enforcement on the theory of unilateral mistake? If it had chosen to do so, could plaintiff Wil-Fred’s have held the subcontractor to its subcontract bid? If the subcontractor had been capable of responding to a judgment for damages in a breach of contract action, should Wil-Fred’s have been denied rescission against the defendant sanitary district, on the ground that enforcement against Wil-Fred’s would not in the circumstances have been unconscionable?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="038bf01a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Effect of unilateral mistake in an advertisement.</i> The <i>BMW Financial</i> court relied heavily on the California Supreme Court decision in Donovan v. RRL Corp., 27 P.3d 702 (Cal. 2001), even though in that earlier case relief for unilateral mistake was granted. In <i>Donovan</i> a car dealer offered a used Jaguar for sale in a newspaper ad for about $12,000 less than the intended price of $38,000 due to proofreading errors made by the newspaper’s staff in composing the ad. Although the <i>Donovan</i> court acknowledged that newspaper ads usually constitute invitations to negotiate rather than offers, the court decided that the ad in this case would constitute an offer, at least when viewed in light of a California consumer protection statute, which requires that a dealer have available for sale any car, that is advertised at a specific price and on specific terms. The plaintiff could thus accept the offer by tendering the full advertised price. The court ruled, however, that the resulting contract was subject to rescission on grounds of unilateral mistake. The erroneous price related to a basic assumption of the contract and had a material adverse effect on the mistaken party. The court further held that the dealer’s failure to discover the mistake did not amount to a “neglect of legal duty” that would bar rescission when the other party suffers no loss. Id. at 717-719. Are you persuaded that the ultimate decision in the <i>BMW Financial</i> case denying relief on grounds of unilateral mistake can be reconciled with the outcome in the <i>Donovan</i> case, which granted rescission?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="038bf01b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Unilateral mistake as to content of writing.</i> In Chapter 2, we first encountered the “objective theory” of contracts, and its corollary, the “duty to read,” which generally binds those who manifest agreement to what they know is intended to be a contract, even if they are ignorant of its contents (recall the Ray v. Eurice <span title="741" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-741">p. 741</span>Bros. case). But the duty to read is not a principle that always carries the day, as we have since learned; it may be overcome by a variety of other protective doctrines, such as lack of capacity, fraud (recall the <i>Park 100</i> case in Chapter 7), or unconscionability. Where the parties are both equally mistaken about the accuracy of the agreement (it contains a typographical error, or a provision has been mistakenly omitted), the remedy of reformation may be available, as discussed in the notes following the <i>Lenawee County</i> case, above. But what if only one party is mistaken, because the agreement says just what the other party meant it to say? Can unilateral mistake provide an avenue of escape for the party who failed to read (or to understand) what he or she signed?</p>
<p id="038bf01c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Nauga, Inc. v. Westel Milwaukee Co., 576 N.W.2d 573 (Wis. Ct. App. 1998), Nauga was a selling agent for Westel, a cellular phone company. The parties were involved in two lawsuits and had disputes about their relationship. The existence of these disputes had not, however, resulted in a severance of the agency relationship between Nauga and Westel. While both of those suits were still in litigation, Westel submitted to Nauga and its other Wisconsin agents a proposed new agency agreement, to replace existing contracts. One clause of the proposed agreement was a release of any claims that the agent might have against Westel under their prior agreements or relationship. Believing that its agreement to this clause would result in Nauga’s surrender of its pending claims against Westel, Nauga’s attorney added to the proposed agency agreement a clause providing for the payment by Westel to Nauga of $250,000 for the settlement of all existing claims. The revised agreement was ultimately signed by Westel, assertedly without either its lawyers or its officers having noticed the existence and effect of the payment clause. (Nauga apparently conceded the truth of Westel’s assertion that Westel never intended to assent to the payment term and was surprised to learn later of its existence.) Westel refused to make the $250,000 payment, and Nauga moved to enforce the settlement agreement. The trial court held that although Nauga was not guilty of fraud, the two parties’ minds had not met, and the contract was not enforceable. A divided appellate court reversed, and gave judgment for plaintiff Nauga. In the absence of ambiguity, fraud, or mutual mistake, enforcement might “seem harsh,” the court conceded, but nevertheless was “based on sound principles.” Id. at 578. A strong dissent argued that the trial court should have been upheld in its conclusion that no enforceable agreement existed, because of Nauga’s violations of good faith, fair dealing, and the duty to cooperate.</p></li>

<p id="038c172f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As we have seen, the defense of mistake is commonly characterized as resting on a mistake by one or both parties as to a fact existing at the time their contract was made. The three doctrines considered in this section — “impossibility,” <span title="742" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-742">p. 742</span>“impracticability,” and “frustration of purpose” — are usually thought of as involving changes in circumstance that occur between the making of the contract and the time set for performance (although there are cases in which the circumstance in question already existed at the time of contracting, not being discovered until later). Of the three, the earliest to evolve was the notion of “impossibility of performance.”</p>
<p id="038c1730-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In order to consider why and when impossibility should constitute a defense to a duty of performance, it may be appropriate first to consider why it should <i>not.</i> To a nonlawyer, it might appear that the duty to perform a contractual obligation would naturally be excused whenever it should appear that the performance itself was literally impossible. To understand why that has not been the case, it is necessary to recall that contractual liability is historically a form of “strict” liability: Nonperformance is actionable simply because the defendant has failed to perform what he or she promised, not because that nonperformance is also “culpable” in any sense. So any failure to perform a contractual obligation — whether willful, negligent, or innocent — should in theory give the aggrieved party a cause of action. If that obligation was in fact impossible to perform, then the remedy for breach obviously could not be specific performance; however, the court still could and presumably would award damages to compensate the plaintiff for the lost value of the defendant’s expected performance.</p>
<p id="038c1731-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The English courts first recognized this principle of strict contractual liability in Paradine v. Jane, 82 Eng. Rep. 897 (K.B. 1647). The case arose during the English Civil War. Jane had leased land from Paradine for a term of years but was dispossessed by a certain Prince Rupert and his army. Jane did not regain possession of the land for almost three years, during which time he paid no rent. When Paradine sued for the unpaid rent, Jane’s defense was that he should be excused from his obligation to pay rent during the period of dispossession. The court held, however, that the plea was insufficient:</p>

<p id="038c1734-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first notable line of exceptions to this rule of strict liability is generally traced to a much later English case, Taylor v. Caldwell, 122 Eng. Rep. 309 (K.B. 1863). There are indications that earlier decisions gave relief from liability for nonperformance where this was occasioned by an Act of God. See Alfred W.B. Simpson, A History of the Common Law of Contract 525-526 (1987). However, Taylor v. Caldwell is generally regarded as the “fountainhead of the modern law of impossibility.” E. Allan Farnsworth, Contracts §9.5, at 621 (4th ed. 2004). In <i>Taylor</i>, the defendant Caldwell had agreed to rent a music hall to plaintiff Taylor for several days, so that Taylor might present musical performances there. The hall burned down shortly before the first performance was to take place, and Taylor sued for breach of contract. The court absolved Caldwell of liability, holding that because the hall itself was “essential” to the performance <span title="743" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-743">p. 743</span>of the contract, and the parties had contracted “on the basis of [its] continued existence,” Caldwell’s duty of performance should be excused by its accidental destruction.</p>
<p id="038c1735-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The principle of Taylor v. Caldwell has been applied to contracts for personal service or for the sale of specific goods: When a person or thing “necessary for performance” of the agreement dies or is incapacitated, is destroyed or damaged, the duty of performance is accordingly excused. See Restatement (Second) §§262, 263; UCC §2-613 (“casualty” to goods “identified when the contract is made” which contract “requires for its performance”). The principle is ordinarily easy to apply to destruction of unique goods (such as a racehorse); its application may be more dubious in cases involving specific goods of a fungible type, because the party seeking excuse will have to convince the court that the contract required for its performance the particular goods that were destroyed. See, e.g., Bende &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Crown Recreation, Inc., 548 F. Supp. 1018 (E.D.N.Y. 1982), <i>aff’d,</i> 722 F.2d 727 (2d Cir. 1983) (seller not excused from duty to deliver combat boots by destruction of boots in train wreck; no showing that contract required those particular boots for its performance). Another situation commonly characterized as a form of “impossibility” (although not involving impossibility in any literal sense) is the prohibition of performance by governmental action. See Restatement (Second) §264; UCC §2-615(a) and Comment 10.</p>
<p id="038c1736-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As suggested above, the doctrine of excuse for impossibility required for its application a showing of <i>literal</i> impossibility — the thing promised simply could not be performed at all. Such a requirement is often referred to as “objective” impossibility — “no one could do it” — as opposed to “subjective” impossibility — “<i>I</i> cannot do it.” See first Restatement §455. This rule therefore would not serve to excuse a party merely because performance had come to be more difficult or expensive or because the contract itself had lost its value to that party. Another English case, decided 40 years after Taylor v. Caldwell, presented the latter situation. In Krell v. Henry, [1903] 2 K.B. 740 (C.A.), the defendant had agreed to pay the plaintiff for the use of a room overlooking the route that the coronation procession of King Edward VII would travel. The sudden illness of the king forced the cancellation of his coronation, however, making the plaintiff’s room useless to the defendant for that purpose on that day. The court held that the defendant was excused from his duty of payment.</p>
<p id="038c1737-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the court in <i>Krell</i> cited and relied on Taylor v. Caldwell and other “impossibility” cases, the result in <i>Krell</i> is generally not viewed as involving any true impossibility (“objective” or otherwise), because the promises of each party could literally have been performed. <i>Krell</i> is explained rather as a case of “frustration of purpose”; the exchange called for by the contract had lost all value to the defendant, because of a supervening change in extrinsic circumstances. (Note here the overlap of doctrines; if, unknown to Krell and Henry, the king’s illness had already occurred at the time the contract was made, the case could also have been analyzed as one of “mutual mistake.”) The doctrine of frustration was endorsed by the first Restatement in §288 (“frustration of object or effect”). The case law actually applying the doctrine remained sparse, however. <span title="744" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-744">p. 744</span>See Nicholas R. Weiskopf, Frustration of Contractual Purpose — Doctrine or Myth? 70 St. John’s L. Rev. 239, 265 (1996) (noting “lack of widespread decisional support”).</p>
<p id="038c1738-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The third of this trilogy of excuses from performance is — like a number of other innovations in contract law — generally attributed to a decision of the California Supreme Court. In Mineral Park Land Co. v. Howard, 156 P. 458 (Cal. 1916), the defendant contractor had agreed to purchase and extract from plaintiff’s land, at fixed prices (varying with the amounts taken), all the gravel required for the construction of a concrete bridge. The defendant procured some of the gravel used in the bridge from another source and was thereupon sued for its failure to take all of its gravel requirements from plaintiff’s land. The defendant showed that it had removed from plaintiff’s land all the gravel that was above water level, and that removal of that which lay below water level would have entailed not only a different means of extraction, but 10 to 12 times as great a cost. The court held that the extreme increase in the cost of extraction justified the defendant’s nonperformance. Even though performance clearly was not literally impossible (indeed, it was not even “subjectively” impossible), it was sufficiently different from what the parties had both contemplated at the time of contracting as to be “impracticable.”</p>
<p id="038c1739-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As did the first Restatement, the Restatement (Second) incorporates the doctrines of impossibility (§§262, 263, 264), impracticability (§§261, 266), and frustration (§§265, 266). As we have already noted, the Uniform Commercial Code also has a rule covering traditional impossibility (§2-613); it also provides in §§2-615 and 2-616 for complete or partial excuse from the duty of performance in cases of impracticability. The ambit of UCC §2-615 is apparently broad enough to encompass instances of both traditional impossibility and impracticability, as well as frustration of purpose.</p>

<p id="038c3d53-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hemlock Semiconductor Operations, LLC (Hemlock) and SolarWorld Industries Sachsen GmbH (Sachsen) are both involved in manufacturing components of solar-power products. They entered into a series of long-term supply agreements (LTAs), by which Hemlock in Michigan would supply Sachsen in Germany with set quantities of polycrystalline silicon (polysilicon) at fixed prices between the years 2006 and 2019. The market price of polysilicon was <span title="745" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-745">p. 745</span>initially well above the LTA price, but the market price plummeted several years later after the Chinese government began subsidizing its national production of polysilicon. The parties reached a temporary agreement to lower the LTA price in 2011. When that agreement expired in 2012, however, the price reverted to the original amount. Hemlock then demanded that Sachsen pay the original LTA price for the specified quantity of polysilicon for the year 2012. Sachsen refused.</p>
<p id="038c3d54-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This caused Hemlock to sue Sachsen for breach of contract in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. Based on Hemlock’s motion for summary judgment, which the district court granted, Hemlock was awarded nearly $800 million in damages and prejudgment interest. For the reasons set forth below, we <b>AFFIRM</b> the judgment of the district court.</p>
<p id="038c3d55-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>I. BACKGROUND</b></p>
<p id="038c3d56-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b><span class="epub-small-caps">A. Factual Background</span></b></p>
<p id="038c3d57-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hemlock and Sachsen negotiated a series of four LTAs. The first LTA (LTA I) was executed in 2005 and was to remain in force through 2015. Subsequent LTAs (LTAs II–IV) extended the parties’ relationship to the end of 2019. The first three LTAs are nearly identical. LTA IV is structured differently than the others, but the text of the provisions at issue is essentially the same as in LTAs I–III.</p>
<p id="038c3d58-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two provisions of the LTAs are particularly relevant to the present case. First, a “take-or-pay” provision required that Sachsen purchase a specified quantity of polysilicon each year at a fixed price. The take-or-pay provision obligated Sachsen to pay this yearly amount even if it declined to take delivery of the polysilicon. Second, in the event that Sachsen failed to pay the specified amount for a given year, Hemlock had the right to terminate the LTAs. Sachsen would then owe Hemlock the full remaining balance of the LTA price, including amounts due for future years. We will refer to this second provision as “the liquidated-damages provision.”</p>
<p id="038c3d59-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After entering into the LTAs, Hemlock began a massive expansion of its manufacturing facilities in the United States at a cost of over $4 billion. The LTAs acknowledged the planned expansion several times. Sachsen was required to make significant advance payments to Hemlock under the LTAs, which were then credited against the purchase price of the polysilicon. Although the LTAs do not explicitly describe the reason for the advance payments, Sachsen acknowledges that the purpose of the payments was to help fund Hemlock’s expansion.</p>
<p id="038c3d5a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the first few years of the LTAs’ existence, Sachsen obtained polysilicon from Hemlock at a price far below the then-current market value. This began to change in 2009, however, when the Chinese government started subsidizing its national production of polysilicon. The result was that the market price of polysilicon eventually dropped below the LTA price.</p>
<p id="038c3d5b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In response, Hemlock and Sachsen negotiated a temporary adjustment to the LTA price in 2011. After that agreement expired the following year, the parties attempted to negotiate further amendments but were unable to reach an <span title="746" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-746">p. 746</span>agreement. The district court’s order granting summary judgment describes the negotiations in detail, which we find no need to repeat.</p>
<p id="038c3d5c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In March 2013, Hemlock sent Sachsen a “Shortfall Notice” that set forth the quantities of polysilicon that Sachsen had failed to purchase under the LTAs in 2012 and that demanded payment pursuant to the take-or-pay provision. Sachsen responded by insisting that it “did not fall short of any purchase obligations,” that the parties had permanently amended the LTAs, and that Hemlock had waived the ability to enforce the LTAs. Two days later, Hemlock sued, seeking the full amount due under the liquidated-damages provision.</p>
<p id="038c3d5d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>B. Procedural Background</b></p>
<p id="038c3d5e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hemlock filed its complaint in the district court against Sachsen in March 2013. In its answer, Sachsen asserted 17 affirmative defenses, including illegality, commercial impracticability, and frustration of purpose. Hemlock moved to strike several of the affirmative defenses under Rule 12(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court granted the motion in part, striking Sachsen’s argument that the LTAs were illegal under European Union (E.U.) and German antitrust laws. Sachsen filed a motion for reconsideration of that decision, arguing that the court erroneously ignored one of Sachsen’s arguments and misinterpreted the burden of proof under the E.U. antitrust laws at issue. The court denied the motion, concluding that despite these alleged errors, Sachsen’s illegality defenses still lacked merit.</p>
<p id="038c3d5f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hemlock subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment in its favor on its breach-of-contract claim. The district court granted the motion, concluding that all of Sachsen’s remaining affirmative defenses were unavailing and that Hemlock was entitled to recover under the liquidated-damages provision. Judgment for the full amount of damages requested by Hemlock, as well as for prejudgment and post-judgment interest, was entered against Sachsen. In a separate order, the district court granted in part Hemlock’s motion for attorney fees and costs.</p>
<p id="038c3d60-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before us on this appeal are the district court’s decisions to strike the illegality defense, to deny reconsideration of the decision to strike that defense, and to grant summary judgment to Hemlock.

<p id="038c6476-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sachsen argues that the district court improperly struck its defense that the LTAs were illegal under E.U. and German antitrust law. According to Sachsen, the LTAs were illegal for two reasons. It first argues that the take-or-pay provision and a separate prohibition on resale are inextricably linked, and that the combination of the two is facially illegal under E.U. and German antitrust law. Second, Sachsen argues that the LTAs violated E.U. antitrust law by tying Sachsen’s predominant demand for polysilicon to a single seller—Hemlock.</p>
<p id="038c6477-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The court noted that plaintiff Hemlock sought to enforce only the take-or-pay provision, not the prohibition on resale, and held that the former promise standing alone would not violate U.S. antitrust law. U.S. Supreme Court precedent dictated that the court should review for illegality only the particular promise that the plaintiff sought to enforce. The court also found that enforcing the take-or-pay provision alone was consistent with E.U. and German antitrust law. Similarly, the court concluded that defendant Sachsen failed to prove that the LTAs violated E.U. regulations that prohibited long-term “tying” contracts. The court thus found no error in the district court’s decision to strike Sachsen’s illegality defense.—<span class="epub-small-caps">Eds</span>.]</p>

<p id="038c6479-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sachsen next argues that the district court erred in concluding that the doctrines of commercial impracticability and frustration of purpose do not excuse Sachsen’s breach of contract. The theory underlying both defenses is that the Chinese government (1) illegally subsidized its national production of polysilicon and dumped massive quantities of the product onto the market, causing the price of polysilicon to fall; and (2) committed acts of “criminal industrial espionage” against Sachsen’s U.S.-based sister company, SWIA. As a result of these illegal actions, Sachsen argues, the price of polysilicon plummeted, rendering Sachsen’s performance impracticable and frustrating the purpose of entering into the LTAs.</p>
<p id="038c647a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We will assume without deciding that the alleged illegal actions by the Chinese government actually occurred. Hemlock does not in fact dispute Sachsen’s evidence that these actions were deemed illegal by both U.S. and E.U. authorities. Rather, Hemlock argues that the district court properly rejected Sachsen’s affirmative defenses because the drop in the price of polysilicon, regardless of cause, was simply a change in market conditions that does not excuse contract performance.<span title="748" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-748">p. 748</span></p>
<p id="038c647b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i><b>1. Sachsen’s Commercial Impracticability Defense Lacks Merit</b></i></p>
<p id="038c647c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sachsen asserts the affirmative defenses of commercial impracticability and impossibility. Both parties and the district court discuss these defenses interchangeably. We will therefore refer to these defenses collectively as “commercial impracticability.”</p>
<p id="038c647d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under Michigan law, a party charged with breaching a contract can assert as an affirmative defense that its performance was rendered impracticable. Capital One Bank USA N.A. v. Ponte, 2013 WL 6692511, at *10 (Mich. Ct. App. Dec. 19, 2013). Performance need not be impossible, but “there must be a showing of impracticability because of extreme and unreasonable difficulty, expense, injury or loss involved.” Roberts v. Farmers Ins. Exch., 275 Mich.App. 58, 737 N.W.2d 332, 342 (2007). . . . The impracticability defense applies only if “an unanticipated circumstance has made performance of the promise vitally different from what should reasonably have been within the contemplation of both parties when they entered into the contract.” <i>Capital One Bank</i>, 2013 WL 6692511, at *10. . . . In other words, the defense is viable only if an unforeseen event occurs and “the non-occurrence of that event [was] . . . a basic assumption on which both parties made the contract.” Karl Wendt Farm Equip. Co. v. Int’l Harvester Co., 931 F.2d 1112, 1117 (6th Cir. 1991) (citing Restatement 2d of Contracts §261 cmt. b) (applying Michigan law).</p>
<p id="038c647e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The expectation that current market conditions will continue for the life of the contract is not such a basic assumption, so shifts in market prices ordinarily do not constitute impracticability. Id. Likewise, the simple fact that a contract has become unprofitable for one of the parties is generally insufficient to establish impracticability. Id. (citing Restatement 2d of Contracts §261 cmt. d). This is especially true when the parties have entered into a contract for the sale of goods at fixed prices because such contracts are made for the very purpose of establishing a stable price despite a fluctuating market. Chainworks, Inc. v. Webco Indus., Inc., 2006 WL 461251, at *10 (W.D. Mich. Feb. 24, 2006) (citing Mich. Comp. Laws §440.2615 cmt. 4 (“Neither is a rise or a collapse in the market itself a justification [for asserting the impracticability defense], for that is exactly the type of business risk which business contracts made at fixed prices are intended to cover.”)).</p>
<p id="038c647f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even relatively drastic changes in the market have been held insufficient to trigger the impracticability defense. In Karl Wendt Farm Equipment Co. v. International Harvester Co., 931 F.2d 1112, 1117 (6th Cir. 1991), for example, this court concluded that the Michigan Supreme Court would not apply the impracticability defense when International Harvester (IH) “experienced a dramatic downturn in the farm equipment market,” decided to go out of business, and breached a dealership agreement by unilaterally terminating it. Id. The court rejected IH’s argument that impracticability excused its contractual duties under circumstances where IH was losing over two million dollars per day. Id. Although the market shift was drastic, it did not alter the parties’ basic assumptions underlying the contract. Id. at 1117–18. The court also noted that applying the doctrine of impracticability would contravene the parties’ intentions regarding assumption of the risk. Id. at 1118. Because the contract provided for termination procedures in the event that certain conditions occurred, <span title="749" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-749">p. 749</span>the court concluded that IH had to bear the risk of financial loss until those procedures were completed; excusing IH’s performance would therefore have unfairly burdened the plaintiff dealer. See id. at 1114, 1118.</p>
<p id="038c6480-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, a district court applying Michigan law concluded that a defendant could not assert an impracticability defense based on the economic downturn of 2008. See Flathead-Michigan I, LLC v. Penninsula Dev., LLC, 2011 WL 940048, at *3–4 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 16, 2011). The fact that the 2008 market collapse and the ensuing recession were unusually disastrous economic shifts did not excuse the defendant’s performance, the court reasoned, because “[t]he state of the market is one of the things on which the parties are gambling when the contract . . . is made.” Id. at *4 (quoting Seaboard Lumber Co. v. United States, 41 Fed. Cl. 401, 417 (Fed. Cl. 1998)).</p>
<p id="038c8b91-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sachsen, however, argues that the impracticability defense should apply because the illegal actions of the Chinese government caused an out-of-the-ordinary drop in the market price for polysilicon. According to Sachsen, the fact that a third party’s illegal actions allegedly caused this market shift differentiates the present case from <i>Karl Wendt</i> and other cases finding that changes in market conditions are not a basis for the impracticability defense.</p>
<p id="038c8b92-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The district court disagreed, reasoning that the allegedly illegal actions of the Chinese government were irrelevant because they had “simply caused a market shift in pricing, making it unprofitable for [Sachsen] to perform as promised.” In so ruling, the court incorporated its reasoning from the court’s decision in Hemlock’s case against another company, Kyocera, under a nearly identical LTA. See Hemlock Semiconductor Corp. v. Kyocera Corp., 2016 WL 67596, at *4 (E.D. Mich. Jan. 6, 2016). Because Sachsen’s argument “amount[ed] only to claims of ‘economic unprofitableness,’” the court concluded that the impracticability defense did not apply for the reasons stated in <i>Karl Wendt</i>. See id. at *4.</p>
<p id="038c8b93-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We find the district court’s reasoning persuasive. Our research has not revealed any caselaw from either this court or the Michigan courts supporting the proposition that a third party’s illegal actions can render the performance of a contract impracticable. Hemlock and Sachsen presumably would not have specifically foreseen the allegedly illegal actions of the Chinese government when the parties entered into the LTAs. But the possibility that the market price for polysilicon could skyrocket or plummet for a myriad of reasons would have been well within their contemplation. The fact that the LTAs provided a fixed price for polysilicon suggests that the parties anticipated that the market price could change and that they wanted to establish a stable price that would operate independently of the market. See <i>Chainworks</i>, 2006 WL 461251, at *10. Allowing Sachsen to escape its obligation to pay that price simply because the purported illegal actions contributed to the price drop would be unfair to Hemlock.</p>
<p id="038c8b94-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying the impracticability defense here could also open up a flood of similar arguments based on allegedly illegal actions of third parties. In the context of global market fluctuations, which can be affected by the actions of many businesses from different countries, defendants in breach-of-contract cases could easily claim that a violation of the law by a third-party actor contributed to a market shift. Allowing parties to litigate the causes of market shifts <span title="750" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-750">p. 750</span>would swallow the general rule that a contract’s unprofitability does not warrant application of the impracticality defense.</p>
<p id="038c8b95-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We also note that Sachsen could have protected itself against a large drop in the market price of polysilicon during the 14-year term of the LTAs by requiring a renegotiation if the market price dropped a certain percentage or dollar amount below the contract price. But no such condition was included in the LTAs despite the sophistication of both the parties and their lawyers. Sachsen thus knowingly assumed the unfiltered risk of a drop in price for a high-tech product during a long-term, fixed-price contract.</p>
<p id="038c8b96-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i><b>2. Sachsen’s Frustration-of-Purpose Defense Also Lacks Merit</b></i></p>
<p id="038c8b97-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sachsen makes the related argument that the Chinese government’s illegal actions frustrated Sachsen’s purpose in entering into the LTAs. Frustration of purpose and impracticability are “overlapping defenses.” <i>Flathead-Michigan I</i>, 2011 WL 940048, at *4. Both defenses require proof that an unforeseen event altered “a basic assumption on which the contract was made.” Liggett Rest. Grp., Inc. v. City of Pontiac, 260 Mich. App. 127, 676 N.W.2d 633, 637 (2003) (quoting Restatement 2d of Contracts §265, cmt. a). The frustration-of-purpose defense also requires that the unforeseen event thwart the parties’ purpose in making the contract to such a degree that “one party’s performance [becomes] virtually worthless to the other.” Id. Like the impracticability defense, the frustration-of-purpose defense generally cannot be based on an argument that the continuation of existing market conditions was a “basic assumption” on which the contract was made. Karl Wendt Farm Equip. Co. v. Int’l Harvester Co., 931 F.2d 1112, 1119–20 (6th Cir. 1991). And courts usually will not assume that “mutual profitability” was the primary purpose of a contract. Id.</p>
<p id="038c8b98-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The frustration-of-purpose defense is inapplicable to the present case for the same reasons that the impracticability defense is inapplicable. Sachsen points to no evidence that the “primary purpose” of the LTAs was anything other than what the district court found it to be—“for Hemlock to provide [Sachsen] with a stable supply of polysilicon at a predictable price.” The court incorporated its reasoning from the court’s earlier decision in <i>Kyocera</i>. See 2016 WL 67596, at *5. Sachsen’s frustration-of-purpose argument essentially amounts to a claim that “mutual profitability” was the purpose of the LTAs. But this argument is unconvincing in light of the fact that the LTAs establish a fixed price under which either party could suffer depending on the relationship of the market price to the LTA price.</p>
<p id="038c8b99-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i><b>3. Sachsen’s Attempts to Distinguish Kyocera and to Rely on an Out-of-State Case Are Unavailing</b></i></p>
<p id="038c8b9a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sachsen next argues that the present case is distinguishable from the decision in <i>Kyocera</i>, which the district court incorporated into its decision granting summary judgment to Hemlock. This case is different, Sachsen insists, because (1) <i>Kyocera</i> was decided at the motion-to-dismiss stage, not at the summary-judgment stage, so there was less evidence in the record; and (2) the Chinese government’s industrial espionage specifically targeted Sachsen’s sister company, whereas the only illegal actions affecting the <i>Kyocera</i> defendant were the <span title="751" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-751">p. 751</span>subsidization and dumping of polysilicon. The difference in procedural stages, however, is unhelpful to Sachsen because its defenses fail as a matter of law for the same reasons that the court in <i>Kyocera</i> dismissed the defendant’s counterclaims. And Sachsen has pointed to no evidence that the industrial espionage aimed at its sister company caused it to suffer anything more than the same drop in market prices that was at issue in <i>Kyocera</i>.</p>
<p id="038c8b9b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sachsen also relies on Chang v. Pacificorp, 212 Or. App. 14, 157 P.3d 243 (2007), an Oregon Court of Appeals decision concluding that the defendant had established a genuine issue of material fact on its impracticability and frustration-of-purpose defenses. In <i>Chang</i>, the defendant asserted these defenses based on a third party’s illegal manipulation of the Dow COB index, an index of market prices for electricity in the relevant geographic area. Id. at 246. The contract at issue in <i>Chang</i> relied on the index in setting prices. Id.</p>
<p id="038c8b9c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hemlock convincingly points out that <i>Chang</i> is distinguishable because (1) the parties’ very purpose in adopting the contract provision in that case was to use the index to allocate risks, and (2) that purpose was frustrated when the index ceased to accurately reflect the true market price for electricity in the relevant geographic area. Here, the contract price was fixed specifically to avoid market fluctuations, just the opposite of the pricing mechanism in <i>Chang</i>. We thus agree that <i>Chang</i> is readily distinguishable. In sum, the district court did not err in rejecting Sachsen’s impracticability and frustration-of-purpose defenses.</p>
<p id="038c8b9d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>D. The District Court Did Not Err in Awarding Hemlock the Full Amount of the Remaining Contract Price as Liquidated Damages, Despite Sachsen’s Argument that the Award Was an Unreasonable Penalty</b></p>
<p id="038c8b9e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sections 5 and 10(b) of LTAs I–III and section 11(c)(iii)(C) of LTA IV provide that, in the event of a breach by Sachsen and termination by Hemlock, the full balance of the contract price for the entire remaining term of the LTAs will be awarded to Hemlock as liquidated damages. Accordingly, after granting summary judgment to Hemlock on its breach-of-contract claim, the district court awarded Hemlock damages in the total amount of $793,467,822.91. This amount included the entire outstanding balance due Hemlock for the full term of each of the LTAs—$585,361,500—plus prejudgment interest. The district court also awarded Hemlock post-judgment interest on the principal amount at the contractually mandated interest rate.</p>
<p id="038c8b9f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sachsen does not dispute that the judgment accurately reflects the outstanding balance or the interest thereon. Instead, Sachsen argues that the LTAs’ provision for the award of the full outstanding balance constitutes an unenforceable penalty rather than permissible liquidated damages.</p>
<p id="038c8ba0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The court first noted that under Michigan law, liquidated damages provisions are enforceable if the agreed amount is reasonably intended to compensate for injury suffered and it is not unconscionable or excessive.

<li class=""><p id="038cb2b5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Comparison of impracticability and frustration doctrines.</i> While the doctrines of impracticability of performance and frustration of purpose are separate grounds for relief from a contract, the elements of the doctrines are nearly identical. In fact, Professor Farnsworth refers to the Restatement synthesis of the two doctrines as “strikingly similar.” E. Allan Farnsworth, Contracts §9.7, at 635 (4th ed. 2004). The doctrines require the disadvantaged party to show: (1) either an extreme change in the nature of performance (“performance is made impracticable”) or an extreme reduction in the value of the other party’s performance so as to render it nearly worthless (“a party’s principal purpose is frustrated”); (2) the occurrence of an event, the nonoccurrence of which was a basic assumption of the contract; (3) without the party’s fault; and (4) the party seeking relief does not bear the risk of that event’s occurrence either under the language of the contract or the surrounding circumstances. Compare Restatement (Second) §§261 (impracticability) and 265 (frustration of purpose). UCC §2-615 is similar and would apply to the sale of goods contract in <i>Hemlock</i>.</p>
<p id="038cb2b6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The Hemlock court found the defendant’s claim of impracticability to be unavailing for a number of reasons, including a lack of proof that the nature of the party’s performance had drastically changed due to the drop in the market price for the goods. The court also noted that there was not a basic assumption that market price would not change. Rather, in setting a fixed price for a long-term contract, the parties specifically contemplated that there might be fluctuations in the market and allocated the risks that prices might go up or down.</i></p>
<p id="038cb2b7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>In a more succinct discussion, the Hemlock court found that the primary purpose of the contract was</i> a stable supply of goods at a predictable price and that there was no frustration of that purpose. The <i>Mel Frank</i> case which follows below further illustrates application of the frustration doctrine.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="038cb2b8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Performance is made impracticable.</i> As the <i>Hemlock</i> court discusses, for performance to be impracticable, it must involve “extreme and unreasonable difficulty” that renders performance of the promise “vitally different” from what the parties contemplated at the time the contract was made. The court cites a number of cases in which a substantial change in circumstances has been held insufficient to establish impracticability. See also John E. Murray, Jr., Murray <span title="753" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-753">p. 753</span>on Contracts, §113, at 712-713 (5th ed. 2011) (noting that it is very difficult to convince a court to excuse a contract due to a significant increase in the cost of performance, even if unforeseeable and caused by factors beyond the promisor’s control). The notes below also underscore the difficulty of satisfying this element of the impracticability defense.</p>
<p id="038cb2b9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As noted in the text before the <i>Hemlock</i> case, however, the seminal impracticability case, Mineral Park Land Co. v. Howard, did grant relief due to a tremendous increase in cost of performance (10 to 12 times greater than anticipated) resulting from unexpected developments. Other courts occasionally find impracticability resulting from an unexpected event that causes an overwhelming increase in the cost of performance. See, e.g., Cape-France Enterprises v. Estate of Peed, 29 P.3d 1011 (Mont. 2001) (impracticability excuse granted after notice from government that underground water pollution plume had spread near seller’s land and that the drilling of a test well required by land sale contract could exacerbate groundwater contamination and expose seller to liability for “unquantifiable” amount of clean-up costs); Iannuccillo v. Material Sand &amp; Stone Corp., 713 A.2d 1234 (R.I. 1998) (excuse granted for impracticability after discovery of unanticipated rock in area designated for excavation would have effectively increased cost of performance from $5,000 to about $65,000). Successful impracticability cases remain rare.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="038cb2ba-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Failure of basic assumption of contract</i> — <i>market failure.</i> To obtain relief under the doctrine of impracticability, the obligor must show that a basic assumption of the contract proved to be wrong due to a change in circumstances. As the <i>Hemlock</i> court indicates, relying primarily on its earlier decision in the <i>Karl Wendt</i> case, continuation of market conditions is generally not such an assumption because parties should know that markets often change dramatically. See, e.g., CRS Proppants LLC v. Preferred Resin Holding Co., LLC, 2016 WL 6094167 (Del. Super. Ct.)

In Bush v. ProTravel International, Inc., 746 N.Y.S. 2d 790 (Civ. Ct. 2002), the plaintiff sought refund of a $1,500 deposit on a planned honeymoon safari trip scheduled for November 2001 even though the contract provided for refund of the deposit only if cancellation notice was received by September 14, 2001, and the plaintiff’s cancellation was not received until September 27, at the earliest. The plaintiff sought to excuse the late cancellation notice on grounds of impracticability due to travel and communication difficulties in New York City in the aftermath of September 11. In denying the defendants’ motion for summary judgment, the court noted that in addition to New York City being under a government-imposed state of emergency in the days immediately following September 11, the plaintiff alleged that damage to telephone systems made it almost physically impossible to place a telephone call from Staten Island, where the plaintiff had retreated, to the travel agent’s office in Manhattan. The court thus decided that the plaintiff should have the opportunity to prove temporary impossibility that would have suspended the cancellation date. Id. at 797. (See Restatement (Second) §269 on temporary impracticability and frustration.)</p>
<p id="038cb2bd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Bush,</i> the defendant travel companies asserted that the plaintiff was simply “skiddish [sic] to travel after September 11,” and that such concerns were an insufficient basis to excuse performance under the contract. Id. at 794. Should fears for personal safety after a terrorist attack constitute a valid basis for a claim of impracticability? See Restatement (Second) Contracts §261, Comment <i>d</i> (performance may be impracticable because it will involve a risk of injury to person or property); but see 7200 Scottsdale Road General Partners v. Kuhn Farm Machinery, 909 P.2d 408 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1995) (conference organizer’s good faith apprehension of terrorism danger to attendees traveling by domestic airlines because of 1991 United States involvement in hostilities in Iraq was not substantial enough to rise to the level of impracticability or frustration and excuse late cancellation of hotel; perception of danger must be “objectively reasonable”).</p>

Some courts have tended to require a showing that the event complained of was at least unforeseen — perhaps even unforeseeable — at the time the parties made their contract. Reflecting the traditional preference for self-protection over paternalism (it should be recalled that the parties seeking excuse in these cases tend to be significant commercial enterprises, not consumers or “Mom and Pop” stores), some courts have felt that any party who can foresee an adverse event has the burden of contracting for protection against it. See, e.g., Sunshine Imp &amp; Exp Corp. v. Luxury Car Concierge, Inc., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60034 (N.D. Ill.) (frustration of purpose, like impossibility, hinges on the foreseeability of the event that is the claimed basis of excuse). Most courts, however, have held that relief under the doctrines of impracticability or frustration of purpose should not be denied simply because the event may have been foreseeable. As one court explained:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="038cd9d0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Foreseeability or even recognition of a risk does not necessarily prove its allocation. Parties to a contract are not always able to provide for all the possibilities of which they are aware, sometimes because they cannot agree, often simply because they are too busy. Moreover, that some abnormal risk was contemplated is probative but does not necessarily establish an allocation of the risk of the contingency which actually occurs.</p>

While both the appellate court and the trial court clearly applied Michigan substantive law, neither court expressly addressed the choice of law question. See Hemlock Semiconductor Corp. v. Deutsche Solar GmbH, 116 F. Supp. 3d 818 (E.D. Mich. 2015) (trial court opinion). You may recall from the discussion of the CISG in Chapter 2 that parties can elect to exclude its application under Article 6. Indeed, inquiry with counsel for Hemlock confirmed that the contracts included a choice-of-law provision designating Michigan state law as governing and specifically disclaiming the CISG.</p>
<p id="038cd9d3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Would the case have come out differently under the CISG? The relevant provision would have been Article 79(1) which reads:</p>

</div>
<p id="038cd9d5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While there are some obvious similarities between Article 79(1) and U.S. domestic law, there may be room for distinctions as well. See Larry A. DiMatteo, Contractual Excuse Under the CISG: Impediment, Hardship, and the Excuse Doctrines, 27 Pace Int’l L. Rev. 261, 277-278, 298-299 (2015) (noting that Article 79 drafting history reflects an intention to differentiate excuse of “impediment” from very restrictive domestic excuse doctrines, but that case law to date has tended not to recognize severe increases in production costs or market prices as excuses for nonperformance under the CISG).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="038cd9d6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Economic analysis of impracticability.</i> In an important article applying principles of economic analysis to the doctrines of impracticability and frustration of purpose, Professors Posner and Rosenfeld argued that the doctrines should be applied to assign the risk of the event to the “superior risk bearer.” When the contract specifically allocates the risk to a party, that party is the superior risk bearer. In the absence of a contractual provision, the risk should be assigned to the party who is in the best position to prevent the event from occurring, or if prevention is not possible, to minimize its consequences at the lowest cost, typically by purchasing insurance. Richard A. Posner &amp; Andrew M. Rosenfeld, Impossibility and Related Doctrines in Contract Law: An Economic Analysis, 6 J. Legal Stud. 83 (1977). Judge Posner applied this approach in Northern Indiana Public Service Co. v. Carbon County Coal Co., 799 F.2d 265 (7th Cir. 1986), to deny relief to a power company that sought to avoid a fixed-price contract for the purchase of coal due to escalating market prices. He held that <span title="757" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-757">p. 757</span>a fixed-price contract is “an explicit assignment of the risk of market price increases to the seller and the risk of market price decreases to the buyer.” Id. at 278. Judge Posner contrasted the case before him with ones involving the destruction of crops:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="038cd9d7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose a grower agrees before the growing season to sell his crop to a grain elevator, and the crop is destroyed by blight and the grain elevator sues. Discharge is ordinarily allowed in such cases. The grower has every incentive to avoid the blight; so if it occurs, it probably could not have been prevented; and the grain elevator, which buys from a variety of growers not all of whom will be hit by blight in the same growing season, is in the better position to buffer the risk of blight than the grower is.</p>
</div>
<p id="038cd9d8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Id. Do you agree with this approach? Why? How would it apply to <i>Hemlock</i>?</p>

E.g., Clark v. Wallace County Cooperative Equity Exchange, 986 P.2d 391 (Kan. Ct. App. 1999) (farmer not excused from contract to sell quantity of corn based on freeze which severely damaged his crop; corn to be delivered under contract was not specified to come from his land). The UCC in Comment 9 to §2-615 suggests that crop failure may be regarded as excusing either under that section or under §2-613 (“Casualty to Identified Goods”) where a farmer has contracted to sell “crops to be grown on designated land.”</p></li>

In May 1994, Di-Chem began negotiating with Mel Frank Tool &amp; Supply, Inc. to lease a storage and distribution facility in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Mel Frank’s real estate agent handled the negotiations so there were no actual face-to-face negotiations between the parties. However, a day before the lease was executed, Mel Frank’s owner, Dennis Frank, talked with Di-Chem representatives who were touring the premises. Frank asked them what Di-Chem was going to be selling and was told chemicals. The agent brought the lease to Frank for his signature.</p>
<p id="038d00f5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The lease appears to be an Iowa State Bar Association form. See Iowa State Bar Association Official Form No. 164. The lease was to start June 1, 1994 and end May 31, 1997. The lease limited Di-Chem’s use of the premises to “storage and distribution.”</p>
<p id="038d00f6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some of the chemicals Di-Chem distributes are considered “hazardous material.” There was no testimony that Dennis Frank was aware of this at the time the lease was executed.

<p id="038d00f7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The lease contained several provisions that bear on the issues in this appeal. One requires Di-Chem to “make no unlawful use of the premises and . . . to comply with all . . .

<p id="038d280a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The letter also informed Di-Chem of the following code deficiencies: complete fire sprinkler system, mechanical exhaust system, spill control, and drainage control.

<p id="038d4f33-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rationale behind the doctrines of impracticability and frustration is whether the nonoccurrence of the circumstance was a basic assumption on which the contract was made. Restatement (Second) of Contracts ch. 11, at 310-311 (1981). The parties need not have been conscious of alternatives for them to have had a “basic assumption.” Restatement (Second) of Contracts ch. 11, at 311 (1981).

The statute applied to the lessees because the premises were within the fire limits of the city and were not of fireproof construction. Id. For this reason, the lessees claimed the statute made its business unlawful, exposed them to criminal prosecution, and deprived them of any substantial or beneficial use of the property thereby releasing them from further obligation to pay rent.

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="038d9d6a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The parties to a lease may lawfully agree or stipulate that if by reason of a subsequent prohibitory or restrictive statute, ordinance, or administrative ruling, the tenant is prevented from legally using the premises for the purpose for which it was contemplated, the tenant may surrender or terminate the lease for which it was contemplated and be relieved from further liability for rent. In the absence of such a provision for termination, however, there is some uncertainty as to the effect of subsequent legal prohibition or restriction on the use of the premises. <i>It may generally be said that in the absence of any such stipulation, a valid police regulation which forbids the use of rented property for certain purposes, but leaves the tenant free to devote the property to other legal uses not forbidden or restricted by the terms of the lease, does not invalidate the lease or affect the rights and liabilities of the parties to the lease. And, even though the lease by its terms restricts the tenant’s use of the premises to certain specified purposes, but not to a single purpose, the prevailing view is that the subsequent enactment of the legislation prohibiting the use of the premises for one, or less than all, of the several purposes specified does not invalidate the lease or justify the tenant in abandoning the property, even though the legislation may render its use less valuable. If there is a serviceable use for which the property is still available consistent with the limitations of the demise, the tenant is not in a position to assert that it is totally deprived of the benefit of the tenancy.</i></p>

A subsequent governmental regulation like a statute or ordinance may prohibit a tenant from legally using the premises for its originally intended purpose. In these circumstances, the tenant’s purpose is substantially frustrated thereby relieving the tenant from any further obligation to pay rent. The tenant is not relieved from the obligation to pay rent if there is a serviceable use still available consistent with the use provision in the lease. The fact that the use is less valuable or less profitable or even unprofitable does not mean the tenant’s use has been substantially frustrated.</p>
<p id="038d9d6d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>C. The Merits</b></p>
<p id="038d9d6e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is clear from the pleadings and testimony that Di-Chem was asserting a defense of frustration of purpose. Di-Chem had the burden of persuasion to prove that defense. See <i>Conklin,</i> 187 Iowa at 822, 174 N.W. at 574. The district court’s decision in favor of Mel Frank is a determination that Di-Chem did not carry its burden on this defense.</p>
<p id="038d9d6f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Di-Chem produced no evidence that <i>all</i> of its inventory of chemicals consisted of hazardous material. In fact, its own correspondence to Mel Frank <span title="764" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-764">p. 764</span>indicates otherwise. For example, Di-Chem’s October 23 letter to Mel Frank stated: “The city’s position that we cannot legally store <i>all</i> of our inventory at this site prior to extensive alteration of the building makes the structure useless to us as a chemical warehouse.” (Emphasis added.) A reasonable inference from this statement is that not all of Di-Chem’s inventory consisted of hazardous material.</p>
<p id="038dc480-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Testimony from one of Di-Chem’s representatives corroborates this inference:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="038dc481-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Q. Were you involved at all in the discussions with the City of Council Bluffs relative to the various code deficiencies that existed at the building? A. My involvement was that the city had pointed out that there was some deficiencies with the building and asked us to remove <i>what</i> chemicals they found objective [sic; objectionable?].</p>
</div>
<p id="038dc482-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(Emphasis added.) Another Di-Chem representative testified that Di-Chem’s product line included industrial chemicals and <i>food additives.</i> Presumably, food additives are not hazardous materials.</p>
<p id="038dc483-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given the posture of this appeal, Di-Chem has to establish as a matter of law that its principal purpose for leasing the facility — storing and distributing chemicals — was substantially frustrated by the city’s actions. Di-Chem presented no evidence as to the nature of its inventory and what percentage of the inventory consisted of hazardous chemicals. The company also failed to show what its lost profits, if any, would be without the hazardous chemicals. Thus, there is no evidence from which the district court could have found the city’s actions substantially frustrated Di-Chem’s principal purpose of storing and distributing chemicals. Put another way, there is insufficient evidence that the city’s action deprived Di-Chem of the beneficial enjoyment of the property for other uses, i.e., storing and distributing nonhazardous chemicals.</p>
<p id="038dc484-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Simply put, Di-Chem failed to establish its affirmative defense of what it has termed impossibility. We must therefore affirm the district court’s decision as to this issue.</p>

<p id="038dc48a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Di-Chem contends that because it was not able to store and distribute the hazardous chemicals, it was “not able to conduct its business on the premises,” as specified in clause 13(b). Di-Chem concludes, therefore, that a “total destruction of business use” occurred in accordance with clause 13(c) and for that reason each party was released from all future obligations under the lease.</p>
<p id="038dc48b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is not even a hint of recognition of clause 13 in the district court’s ruling. The reason is obvious: clause 13 simply does not apply to the facts of this case. Clause 13 must be read in its entirety and construed in context.</p>
<p id="038dc48c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the title in clause 13 suggests, the clause’s language covers the situation where there has been a temporary interruption of the tenant’s business because of a partial destruction of the premises. In these circumstances, the lease gives the landlord a period of time to repair or rebuild. During this period the tenant’s rent abates but the lease continues in force.</p>
<p id="038dc48d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Clause 13 also covers the situation where the landlord cannot rebuild or repair the premises because of some zoning prohibition. A common example involves a nonconforming use. Typically, zoning ordinances prohibit an owner from rebuilding if, for example, fifty percent of the building has been destroyed. In these circumstances, the tenant cannot legally continue in business on the premises and for this reason the lease considers the tenant’s business use has been totally destroyed. In this situation, both the landlord and the tenant have the option to terminate the lease with no further obligation on either’s part.</p>
<p id="038deb9e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One cannot reasonably interpret clause 13 to cover the situation where a subsequent governmental regulation prohibits the use of the premises for one of several purposes specified in the lease.

<li class=""><p id="038deba6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Governmental regulation as basis for excuse.</i> Although the lessee in <i>Mel Frank</i> did not succeed, the courts have been much more willing to grant relief when the event on which the claim of impracticability or frustration rests is some form of supervening governmental regulation rather than cases in which the event is war, natural disaster, or market change. Indeed, the UCC in §2-615 makes specific mention of “compliance in good faith with any applicable foreign or domestic governmental regulation or order” as a basis for relief. See also Restatement (Second) of Contracts §264 (recognizing compliance with foreign or domestic governmental order as a basis for excuse under the doctrine of impracticability). Examples include Harriscom Svenska, AB v. Harris Corp., 3 F.3d 576 (2d Cir. 1993) (seller of radio equipment excused on grounds of impracticability after government regulations on transfer of military equipment to Iran led to compromise with U.S. government that required discontinuation of sales to plaintiff distributor; not necessary that the law indisputably required or prohibited conduct, as long as party seeking relief acted in good faith compliance with government’s clear determination to prohibit the sales); M.J. Paquet, Inc. v. N.J. DOT, 794 A.2d 141 (N.J. 2002) (contract excused for impracticability because revised OSHA regulations governing refurbishment of bridges painted with lead-based paint would have resulted in substantial, unanticipated increase in cost of performance).</p>
<p id="038deba7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite a receptiveness to claims of excuse where performance is prevented by supervening governmental action, courts will still impose stringent limits on such relief in that category of frustration cases as well as any other, as demonstrated by the <i>Mel Frank</i> decision. Those limits include the requirement that frustration be quite substantial. The <i>Mel Frank</i> court stated that the performance must be rendered “virtually worthless” and other courts have similarly stated that the principal purpose of the contract must be substantially undermined. See, e.g., Wheelabrator Environmental Systems v. Galante, 136 F. Supp. 2d 21 (D. Conn. 2001) (contract for “waste-to-energy resource recovery” was made less profitable by court decision invalidating mandatory municipal waste disposal ordinances but not excused because principal purpose was <span title="767" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-767">p. 767</span>not “utterly defeated”). Additionally, courts may also deny relief on the basis of frustration if the supervening event was foreseeable and the complaining party did not guard against the occurrence or otherwise assumed the risk. See City of Starkville v. 4-County Electric Power Ass’n, 819 So. 2d 1216 (Miss. 2002) (frustration excuse not available because possible change in eminent domain laws that rendered contract less profitable was foreseeable at the time contract was made).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="038deba8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Relief under the UCC.</i>  As noted in the introduction to this section of Chapter 8, UCC §2-615 is broad enough to encompass impracticability as well as frustration. The Code section expressly addresses excuse of performance by a seller on the ground of impracticability but does not mention relief to a buyer. Nonetheless, the courts have been willing to grant relief to buyers as well as sellers. See Comment 9 to §2-615, suggesting the section could properly be applied to buyers in appropriate circumstances. See Power Engineering &amp; Manufacturing, Ltd. v. Krug Int’l, 501 N.W.2d 490 (Iowa 1993) (although Code section expressly mentions only sellers, impracticability defense is equally available to buyers; however, inability of buyer to make planned shipments to Iraq did not establish impracticability). But see Sudamax Industria E Comercio De Cigaros, LTDA v. Buttes &amp; Ashes, Inc., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23265 (W.D. Ky.) (impracticability is a seller’s excuse not available to buyers).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="038deba9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Force majeure clauses.</i> The lessee in <i>Mel Frank</i> also sought to escape the contract based on a portion of the contract which addressed the possibilities of partial or total destruction of the leased facility or a change in zoning law. Such “force majeure” clauses typically provide for excuse where performance is prevented or delayed by circumstances “beyond the control” of the party seeking excuse. Besides governmental regulation, force majeure clauses are likely to enumerate other particular types of excusing events, such as natural events (windstorm, fire, flood, etc. — often called “acts of God”), prevention by outside forces (war, riot, civil commotion, etc.), and strikes and labor disputes. To a large extent, force majeure clauses merely track ground now covered by UCC §2-615 and corresponding provisions of the Restatement. They may attempt to go further, however, to provide an excuse where the law would not do so. The few cases that have considered the issue have concluded that this is permissible. See PPG Indus., Inc. v. Shell Oil Co., 919 F.2d 17 (5th Cir. 1990) (court rejected buyer’s argument that §2-615 imposes limitations on force majeure clauses but recognized that the doctrine of good faith applied to prohibit term that would be manifestly unreasonable). Of course, force majeure clauses, like other contractual provisions, will be subject to doctrines of interpretation, including the maxim of <i>contra proferentem.</i> See also Route 6 Outparcels, LLC v. Ruby Tuesday, Inc., 931 N.Y.S.2d 436 (App. Div. 2011) (parties’ “fairly broad” force majeure clause would not include 2008 global financial crisis as legal excuse for failure to construct new restaurant as required by contract).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="038debaa-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Economic downturn and real estate finance</i>. Beginning in 2006, as part of a global economic downturn, the United States experienced the most drastic drop in home values since the Great Depression. See Arthur E. Wilmarth, Jr., The Dark Side of Universal Banking: Financial Conglomerates and the Origins <span title="768" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-768">p. 768</span>of the Subprime Financial Crisis, 41 Conn. L. Rev. 963, 967 (2009) (estimating the total decline in U.S. home values between mid-2006 and the end of 2008 at $6 trillion). This crisis led to the inability of borrowers to repay mortgage loans and to widespread default. Should borrowers be able to claim excuse based on frustration of purpose or impracticability? What would be the implications of judicial acceptance of those theories? See Bean v. BAC Home Loans Servicing, L.P., 2012 WL 10349 (D. Ariz.) (rejecting impracticability and frustration arguments where home’s value dropped to only half the amount of mortgage). Cf. Tri-Town Const. Co., Inc. v. Commerce Park Associates 12, LLC, 139 A.3d 467 (R.I. 2016) (promissory note held enforceable against buyer of land for condo development even after “Great Recession” allegedly made financing unavailable; no evidence of shared basic assumption that financing would remain available nor proof that building condos was impossible).</p></li>

<p id="038e12bd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You are an attorney in Garrett’s Landing, a small city in one of the southern states. You have just been consulted by Arthur Barlow, proprietor of a florist shop in your city, who tells you the following story:</p>
<p id="038e12be-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Several years ago I went to work for Sam and Martha Stewart as a clerk in their florist shop, over by Good Samaritan Hospital, on Mackenzie Street. I’d only been out of high school a few years, had a few jobs, none of which seemed likely to go anywhere much; this seemed like a chance to learn a business from the inside, and from people who were getting on in years and might be willing to take me in as a partner eventually. Well, the business did well enough, and they paid me a decent salary, so I stayed on, and just when I was getting up enough nerve to ask whether they might be willing to take me in as a partner, Martha died very unexpectedly. Naturally, this threw Sam pretty badly, and for a while there I pretty much ran the business single-handed.</p>
<p id="038e12bf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“When Sam got on his feet again I was about to make him an offer when he surprised me by making <i>me</i> one. He said he’d decided to retire, said he thought he might sell his house, go and live with his daughter over in Marshallsburg, and did I want to buy the business? I said I sure did, if the price was right. We talked it over, and he said there were eight years to go on his lease, and he was sure Mrs. Duval, the owner of the building, would agree to his assigning the lease to me, and that he’d sell me the business for $100,000 — that is, $80,000 for the fixtures, office equipment, and inventory and $20,000 for good will. That struck me as a real good price, knowing what I did about the earnings of the shop. I said the figure was all right with me, provided I could pay him $20,000 now and $20,000 a year over the next four years; that way I could pay him out of the earnings of the business. He said that was acceptable to him, and he showed me the bill of sale that Jonah Cartwright’s lawyer had drawn up nearly 30 years ago when old Cartwright sold the business to Sam. (It was called Good Samaritan Florist Shop then, just like it is now.) I read it through and said it sounded okay to me and told Sam to draw up one just like it, and that would be our contract. I raised the $20,000 by borrowing from my uncle, and I took over the shop.</p>
<p id="038e12c0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="769" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-769">p. 769</span>“Well, all that happened last March, and since then I’ve been running the shop myself, with one helper. So far it’s gone pretty good. This week, though, I got a real shock. The Board of Trustees of Good Samaritan Hospital announced — maybe you saw the story in the paper? — that the hospital was merging with Mercy Hospital, over on the other side of town, that a new wing would be built on Mercy, and the old Good Samaritan Building would be torn down. I don’t have to tell you, I guess, what a bad piece of news that is for me. My shop is in an old part of town, and the best part of my business is from people who come to visit sick folks at the hospital; both the new shopping centers in town have florists, and I can’t compete with them for the suburban trade. Without the hospital, I’m dead. It’s been there for 80 years; I never dreamed it wouldn’t be there forever. What really gravels me, though, is old Sam Stewart. I can see now why he made me such a good price for the business. I’m sure he knew the hospital was planning to close. A decision like that, it isn’t made overnight, they must have been considering it as long ago as last March. And Sam’s cousin, Maureen Leonard, she’s a doctor at Good Samaritan, and she’s on the governing board there. Sam saw the handwriting on the wall and unloaded on me, I know he did. And what I want to know is, what can I do about it?”</p>
<p id="038e12c1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before attempting to answer his question, you ask Barlow to show you the “Bill of Sale,” signed by Stewart and Barlow as Seller and Buyer. It recites that Stewart is selling to Barlow “all the assets, stock in trade, fixtures, and good will of the business presently operated by Seller as ‘Good Samaritan Flower Shop,’ on Mackenzie Street, in Garrett’s Landing.” It also contains the following language: “Seller represents and warrants that he is the owner of, and has full power to convey, the property which is the subject of this Bill of Sale. Seller makes no other representations or warranties whatever with respect to this property, and Buyer’s acceptance of this Bill of Sale so acknowledges.” The document also contains a promise by Barlow to pay Stewart $20,000 on delivery and $20,000 a year for the next four years; the promise is not qualified or conditioned by any reference to the earnings of the business.</p>
<p id="038e12c2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What causes of action could Mr. Barlow assert to rescind the agreement with Mr. Stewart? How would you evaluate the likelihood of success of these causes of action?</p>

<p id="038e12c8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In June 2018, Beth and Bob Byers were looking for a lot near Rustic Lake in Rustic County on which they wished to build a house for their residence. With the assistance of their real estate agent, Don Drew, the Byers looked at a parcel of unimproved property that was available for sale and placed between some existing <span title="770" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-770">p. 770</span>houses. At the Byers’ request, the agent for Sara Seller provided the Byers with a Property Disclosure Statement, outlining the conditions of the real property known to Seller who had owned the property for ten years. On this statement, Seller marked “Yes” in response to the question, “Are you aware of any past or present drainage or flooding problems on the property?” Because of this disclosure, Mr. Drew contacted Sara’s real estate agent to inquire further as to the nature of the drainage and flooding issues with the property. Sara responded stating that she marked “Yes” because she was aware the property had flooded during the massive storm of May 2015, which affected many properties in Rustic County.</p>
<p id="038e39d9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Byers then hired Paul Parker, a general contractor and builder, to visit the property and assess whether there were any flooding or drainage problems with the lot that could impede the Byers’ ability to build a house on the lot. Mr. Parker inspected the property and reviewed the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) flood panel and Flood Insurance Rate Map (“FIRM”), after which he determined that there were no flooding or drainage problems that would hinder Buyers’ ability to construct a house on the lot.</p>
<p id="038e39da-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On July 1, 2018, the Byers executed a Land Purchase Agreement whereby they agreed to purchase the lot for $100,000, with $10,000 paid at signing and $2500 paid quarterly for the next nine years. The contract contained a Section 6 which provided:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="038e39db-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>6. Inspections and other requirements made a part of this Agreement.</b> [B]uyer shall have the right and responsibility to enter the property during normal business hours for the purpose of making inspections and/or tests. Buyer shall make such inspections as indicated in this paragraph and either accept the property in its present condition by written notice to Seller or terminate the Agreement as provided for each section marked below.</p>
</div>
<p id="038e39dc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Byers “checked” the box immediately preceding the stipulation labeled, “Building Permit,” which gave the Byers the option to withdraw from the contract if they were “unable to acquire the necessary licenses and permits to make specific improvements on the Property and notified Sellers of this fact within thirty days of the date of contracting.” The Byers did not check a box for the stipulation which read, “No Inspection Contingencies. Buyer accepts the Property in its present condition. All parties acknowledge and agree that the Property is being sold ‘AS IS’ with any and all faults.”</p>
<p id="038e39dd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Over the next nine months, Mr. Parker, the contractor retained by Byers, developed building and site plans for the property. In December 2018, Mr. Parker obtained a building permit from the Rustic County Building Department for the Byers’ new home on the property. Mr. Parker began work on the property in March 2019. One week after construction commenced, Mr. Parker was informed by Rustic County officials that the property was located in an area of “localized flooding” under a new zoning program that the county had established and that took effect on January 1, 2019. The zoning classification would require special measures to ensure the property would not cause flooding to adjacent property. Mr. Parker immediately stopped construction and notified the Byers of this development.</p>
<p id="038e39de-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="771" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-771">p. 771</span>The Byers then hired a professional engineer, Wesley Warren, to assess the ramifications of the county’s determination. Following an extensive study, Mr. Warren concluded that the property generally lies at a lower elevation than the surrounding lots and often receives surface and subsurface rainwater runoff from the adjacent lots. He estimates that property must have flooded at least every other year since the neighborhood was subdivided in 1999. Mr. Warren determined that the “localized flooding” zoning classification by Rustic County was consistent with industry standards given the property’s drainage issues. He further determined that the lot would need extensive modifications to prevent flooding; however, these modifications would be extremely costly, an estimated $150,000, and might subject the Byers to future liability due to the displacement of water onto neighboring parcels. Given the unique challenges of this particular parcel, Mr. Warren determined the lot had not been suitable for residential construction since 1999 and it would not be suitable now, even if the county waived the zoning restrictions. As a result, the Byers abandoned the thought of constructing a house on the lot.</p>

<p id="038e39e2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have earlier studied the doctrine of consideration (as a basis for enforcement of a promise), the implied obligation of good faith (both under the UCC and as an element of general contract law), and the concept of duress (as a defense to liability for nonperformance of what would otherwise be an enforceable promise). We have also surveyed a variety of doctrines designed to give relief from the effect of changed circumstances, where those have deprived one of the contracting parties of what may appear to be the benefit fairly to be expected from the originally agreed-to exchange. And we have addressed the statute of frauds, a set of rules requiring writing for enforceability. In this section we will consider a situation in which a number of these doctrines and rules may be brought to bear in deciding the relative rights and duties of the parties: the modification of a preexisting executory contract.</p>

<p id="038e60f6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You are vice-president and general counsel for Associated Department Stores, Inc., which owns and operates “Schweitzer’s,” a large department store in your city. Schweitzer’s has recently been in the throes of some remodeling, reorganizing, and overall image-upgrading, dropping some lines of goods, adding others, and generally attempting to create a more high-fashion atmosphere in the store. Today you receive a call from Edna Carmody, another Associated <span title="772" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-772">p. 772</span>executive, who has general responsibility for planning and coordinating the organization and remodeling of the various women’s apparel departments. She tells you the following story:</p>
<p id="038e60f7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“You probably know that the new women’s designer salon on three is scheduled to open at the end of this month; we’ve had promotions in the papers and on local TV for days about the celebrity fashion show and the charity cocktail party we’re throwing for the benefit of the county historical society. Well, virtually everything is done except the laying of the new flooring, which we purposely had left until after the new ceiling tiles and lighting tracks had been installed, and the wallpaper hung, so it wouldn’t get the wear of several sets of workmen over it right away. Waller Brothers agreed to do the floor for us — to provide the labor and flooring material and to have the whole job done by next Thursday at the latest. They are the local distributors for EverWare floor tile, which is probably the best product for our needs, and they contracted to install EverWare in the ‘Starship’ pattern, which we picked to complement the wallpaper and lighting fixtures we had selected.</p>
<p id="038e60f8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Just now I had a call from Jack Waller, who told me that the EverWare Company has notified them that every shipment of EverWare tile from now on — including the lot for our store, which is on its way to the Wallers’ now — will be billed to them at a 30 percent increase over the previous prices, due to a settlement EverWare had to make with its employees to prevent a strike, they said. Jack told me that the increase was more than he and Ralph could absorb, and that they had talked it over and agreed that they would have to charge us at least 20 percent more per foot for the Starship tile we ordered. I told him I certainly sympathized with their problem, but I didn’t feel they had any right to ask us to agree to a price increase at this point, since for five weeks we had had a firm written contract with them for an agreed price. Jack didn’t exactly quarrel with that, but he said he was surely sorry we didn’t see things their way, and then he went on to say that these rising costs really had them in a bind, and they thought they’d probably have to lay off some of their help, and it might be pretty difficult to get their work done on schedule under those conditions. Then he said why didn’t I think it over for a while, and talk it over with some of the other people here at Schweitzer’s; he said he felt sure then I’d see things his way, and that he’d expect me to call him back in a few hours.</p>
<p id="038e60f9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Even if he’s telling me the truth about their being hit with a surprise price increase, it seems to me they’re way out of line in expecting us to absorb it. Do we have to? And if we say no, what happens if they pull a slowdown on us? Lots of faces are going to be red around here, mine in particular, if all that promotion effort for the new women’s shop goes out the window because the redecorating isn’t done. I haven’t tried yet, of course, but I’m sure we can’t get someone else to do the floor on such short notice. Even if we could, no one else stocks the pattern we need to do the job right; the Wallers are exclusive distributors for EverWare in this town. Do they have us over a barrel?”</p>
<p id="038e60fa-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "></p>
<p id="038e60fb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Obviously, before attempting to advise Ms. Carmody how she might proceed in this situation, you will want to consider the effect of the original <span title="773" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-773">p. 773</span>agreement with Waller Brothers. You know that there is indeed a “firm written contract . . . for an agreed price” between Associated Department Stores, Inc., and Waller Brothers, because at your direction all agreements with contractors for the renovation were made on purchasing order forms used by Associated. You know that this form contains a standard “force majeure” clause, and also that it contains the following language: “This is the entire agreement of the parties, superseding all prior agreements. No additions or modifications to, or any waivers of provisions contained in, this agreement shall be binding unless in writing and signed by both parties.”</p>
<p id="038e60fc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before deciding on the course of action Associated should pursue, you will need to consider the following questions (and perhaps others as well): (1) Can Waller Brothers rely on changes in circumstance occurring since the agreement was made to justify nonperformance on its part? (2) If Associated should (for whatever combination of legal and/or practical reasons) agree to pay Waller Brothers a higher price for the tile work, could it later refuse to pay the amount of the increase, on the ground that its agreement to that increase either was void for lack of consideration, or was entered into as a product of bad faith or duress on Waller Brothers’ part? (3) Even if an agreement to pay the increased price would otherwise be enforceable, if you can avoid putting it in writing, can Associated later refuse to pay on the basis of the contractual language quoted above?</p>

The libel in this case was based upon a contract alleged to have been entered into between the libelants and the appellant corporation on the 22d day of May, 1900, at Pyramid Harbor, Alaska, by which it is claimed the appellant promised to pay each of the libelants, among other things, the sum of $100 for services rendered and to be rendered. In its answer the respondent denied the execution, on its part, of the contract sued upon, averred that it was without consideration, and for a third defense alleged that the work performed by the libelants for it was performed under other and different contracts than that sued on, and that, prior to the filing of the libel, each of the libelants was paid by the respondent the full amount due him thereunder, in consideration of which each of them executed a full release of all his claims and demands against the respondent.</p>

<p></p>

<p id="038e8818-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the 15th day of April, 1900, 21 of the libelants signed shipping articles by which they shipped as seamen on the Two Brothers, a vessel chartered by the appellant for the voyage between San Francisco and Pyramid Harbor, and also bound themselves to perform the same work for the appellant provided for by the previous contract of March 26th; the appellant agreeing to pay them therefor the sum of $60 for the season, and two cents each for each red salmon in the catching of which they should respectively take part. Under these contracts, the libelants sailed on board the Two Brothers for Pyramid Harbor, where the appellant had about $150,000 invested in a salmon cannery. The libelants arrived there early in April of the year mentioned, and began to unload the vessel and fit up the cannery. A few days thereafter, to wit, May 19th, they stopped work in a body, and demanded of the company’s superintendent there in charge $100 for services in operating the vessel to and from Pyramid Harbor, instead of the sums stipulated for in and by the contracts; stating that unless they were paid this additional wage they would stop work entirely, and return to San Francisco. The evidence showed, and the court below found, that it was impossible for the appellant to get other men to take the places of the libelants, the place being remote, the season short and just opening; so that, after endeavoring for several days without <span title="775" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-775">p. 775</span>success to induce the libelants to proceed with their work in accordance with their contracts, the company’s superintendent, on the 22d day of May, so far yielded to their demands as to instruct his clerk to copy the contracts executed in San Francisco, including the words “Alaska Packers’ Association” at the end, substituting, for the $50 and $60 payments, respectively, of those contracts, the sum of $100, which document, so prepared, was signed by the libelants before a shipping commissioner whom they had requested to be brought from Northeast Point; the superintendent, however, testifying that he at the time told the libelants that he was without authority to enter into any such contract, or to in any way alter the contracts made between them and the company in San Francisco. Upon the return of the libelants to San Francisco at the close of the fishing season, they demanded pay in accordance with the terms of the alleged contract of May 22d, when the company denied its validity, and refused to pay other than as provided for by the contracts of March 26th and April 5th, respectively. Some of the libelants, at least, consulted counsel, and, after receiving his advice, those of them who had signed the shipping articles before the shipping commissioner at San Francisco went before that officer, and received the amount due them thereunder, executing in consideration thereof a release in full, and the others being paid at the office of the company, also receipting in full for their demands.</p>
<p id="038e8819-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the trial in the court below, the libelants undertook to show that the fishing nets provided by the respondent were defective, and that it was on that account that they demanded increased wages. On that point, the evidence was substantially conflicting, and the finding of the court was against the libelants, the court saying:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="038e881a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The contention of libelants that the nets provided them were rotten and unserviceable is not sustained by the evidence. The defendant’s interest required that libelants should be provided with every facility necessary to their success as fishermen, for on such success depended the profits defendant would be able to realize that season from its packing plant, and the large capital invested therein. In view of this self-evident fact, it is highly improbable that the defendant gave libelants rotten and unserviceable nets with which to fish. It follows from this finding that libelants were not justified in refusing performance of their original contract. [112 Fed. 554.]</p>
</div>
<p id="038e881b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The evidence being sharply conflicting in respect to these facts, the conclusions of the court, who heard and saw the witnesses, will not be disturbed. . . . </p>
<p id="038e881c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The real questions in the case as brought here are questions of law, and, in the view that we take of the case, it will be necessary to consider but one of those. Assuming that the appellant’s superintendent at Pyramid Harbor was authorized to make the alleged contract of May 22d, and that he executed it on behalf of the appellant, was it supported by a sufficient consideration? From the foregoing statement of the case, it will have been seen that the libelants agreed in writing, for certain stated compensation, to render their services to the appellant in remote waters where the season for conducting fishing operations is extremely short, and in which enterprise the appellant had a large amount of money invested; and, after having entered upon the discharge of <span title="776" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-776">p. 776</span>their contract, and at a time when it was impossible for the appellant to secure other men in their places, the libelants, without any valid cause, absolutely refused to continue the services they were under contract to perform unless the appellant would consent to pay them more money. Consent to such a demand, under such circumstances, if given, was, in our opinion, without consideration, for the reason that it was based solely upon the libelants’ agreement to render the exact services, and none other, that they were already under contract to render. The case shows that they willfully and arbitrarily broke that obligation. As a matter of course, they were liable to the appellant in damages, and it is quite probable, as suggested by the court below in its opinion, that they may have been unable to respond in damages. But we are unable to agree with the conclusions there drawn, from these facts, in these words:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="038e881d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under such circumstances, it would be strange, indeed, if the law would not permit the defendant to waive the damages caused by the libelants’ breach, and enter into the contract sued upon, — a contract mutually beneficial to all the parties thereto, in that it gave to the libelants reasonable compensation for their labor, and enabled the defendant to employ to advantage the large capital it had invested in its canning and fishing plant.</p>
</div>
<p id="038e881e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Certainly, it cannot be justly held, upon the record in this case, that there was any voluntary waiver on the part of the appellant of the breach of the original contract. The company itself knew nothing of such breach until the expedition returned to San Francisco, and the testimony is uncontradicted that its superintendent at Pyramid Harbor, who, it is claimed, made on its behalf the contract sued on, distinctly informed the libelants that he had no power to alter the original or to make a new contract; and it would, of course, follow that, if he had no power to change the original, he would have no authority to waive any rights thereunder. The circumstances of the present case bring it, we think, directly within the sound and just observations of the supreme court of Minnesota in the case of King v. Railway Co., 61 Minn. 482, 63 N.W. 1105:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="038eaf2f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No astute reasoning can change the plain fact that the party who refuses to perform, and thereby coerces a promise from the other party to the contract to pay him an increased compensation for doing that which he is legally bound to do, takes an unjustifiable advantage of the necessities of the other party. Surely it would be a travesty on justice to hold that the party so making the promise for extra pay was estopped from asserting that the promise was without consideration. A party cannot lay the foundation of an estoppel by his own wrong, where the promise is simply a repetition of a subsisting legal promise. There can be no consideration for the promise of the other party, and there is no warrant for inferring that the parties have voluntarily rescinded or modified their contract. The promise cannot be legally enforced, although the other party has completed his contract in reliance upon it.</p>

<p id="038eaf30-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Lingenfelder v.

<p id="038eaf31-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is urged upon us by respondents that this was a new contract. New in what? Jungenfeld was bound by his contract to design and supervise this building. Under the new promise, he was not to do anything more or anything different. What benefit was to accrue to Wainwright? He was to receive the same service from Jungenfeld under the new, that Jungenfeld was bound to tender under the original contract. What loss, trouble, or inconvenience could result to Jungenfeld that he had not already assumed? No amount of metaphysical reasoning can change the plain fact that Jungenfeld took advantage of Wainwright’s necessities, and extorted the promise of five per cent, on the refrigerator plant as the condition of his complying with his contract already entered into. Nor had he even the flimsy pretext that Wainwright had violated any of the conditions of the contract on his part. Jungenfeld himself put it upon the simple proposition that “if he, as an architect, put up the brewery, and another company put up the refrigerating machinery, it would be a detriment to the Empire Refrigerating Company,” of which Jungenfeld was president. To permit plaintiff to recover under such circumstances would be to offer a premium upon bad faith, and invite men to violate their most sacred contracts that they may profit by their own wrong. That a promise to pay a man for doing that which he is already under contract to do is without consideration is conceded by respondents. The rule has been so long imbedded in the common law and decisions of the highest courts of the various states that nothing but the most cogent reasons ought to shake it. [Citing a long list of authorities.] But it is “carrying coals to Newcastle” to add authorities on a proposition so universally accepted, and so inherently just and right in itself.</p>

What we hold is that, when a party merely does what he has already obligated himself to do, he cannot demand an additional compensation therefor; and although, by taking advantage of the necessities of his adversary, he obtains a promise for more, the law will regard it as nudum pactum, and will not lend its process to aid in the wrong.</p>

<li class=""><p id="038eaf36-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Identifying the parties.</i> The terminology of <i>Alaska Packers’ Assn</i> is apt to be a bit confusing, since the same party — the Packers’ Association — is at different places referred to as the “appellant” and the “respondent.” The explanation lies in the nature of the case as an admiralty claim, or “libel”; the plaintiffs are referred to as “libelants,” and the defendant, responding to the libel, is the “respondent.” The defendant/respondent is also the “appellant,” because the petitioners prevailed below.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="038eaf37-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Pre-existing duty rule.</i> The <i>Alaska Packers’</i> decision reflects the fundamental tenet that merely promising to perform an existing obligation will not serve as valid consideration for additional return compensation from the other <span title="778" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-778">p. 778</span>party. This rule continues to be applied, at least as a starting point, even though courts accept even a small or modest addition to or alteration of performance as enough to satisfy the rule. Compare Aerel, S.R.L. v. PCC Airfoils, L.L.C., 448 F.3d 899 (6th Cir. 2006) (alleged promise to pay additional commissions for services already required by contract would constitute unenforceable, one-sided modification), with Oscar v. Simeonidis, 800 A.2d 271 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2002) (even insignificant or slight new consideration in modification of lease agreement, such as paying rent one day in advance, would be valid to support modification). If the plaintiffs in <i>Alaska Packers’ Assn</i> had by good fortune had a lawyer among their number, could they with his counsel have formulated a wage-increase agreement with their employer that would have satisfied the consideration test applied by the court in the above opinion? How? If so, who would have won the case? Could the defendant’s other arguments have been foreseen and forestalled by informed lawyering?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="038eaf38-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Policing coercive behavior.</i> In discussing the pre-existing duty rule as a barrier to enforcement of a contract modification, Professor Farnsworth referred to <i>Alaska Packers’</i> (along with the <i>Lingenfelder</i> case, quoted and discussed in <i>Alaska Packers’</i>) as a case where “particularly outrageous threats” were made to coerce a one-sided modifying agreement. E. Allan Farnsworth, Contracts §4.22, at 273 n.15 (4th 2004). In Selmer Co. v. Blakeslee-Midwest Co., 704 F.2d 924, 927 (7th Cir. 1983), Judge Posner offered his own approbation of <i>Alaska Packers’</i>:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="038eaf39-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It undermines the institution of contract to allow a contract party to use the threat of breach to get the contract modified in his favor not because anything has happened to require modification in the mutual interest of the parties but simply because the other party, unless he knuckles under to the threat, will incur costs for which he will have no adequate legal remedy. If contractual protections are illusory, people will be reluctant to make contracts. Allowing contract modifications to be voided in circumstances such as those in <i>Alaska Packers’ Assn.</i> assures prospective contract parties that signing a contract is not stepping into a trap, and by thus encouraging people to make contracts promotes the efficient allocation of resources.</p>
</div>
<p id="038ed64a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Farnsworth and Posner view of this case is more likely to seem appropriate the more strongly one is persuaded that the plaintiffs there were actually lying about their working conditions. Although the evidence on that point was “sharply conflicting,” the trial court found on this issue for the defendants, apparently in large measure because plaintiffs’ testimony that the defendant had not provided them with serviceable nets was “highly improbable,” the defendant’s interest requiring that the plaintiffs be supplied with “every facility necessary to their success as fishermen.” Do you agree? To the extent that the pre-existing duty rule serves essentially as a guard against coercive behavior, would it be better to police that conduct directly and otherwise to enforce all consensual modifications? For a study suggesting such an approach would be desirable, see Kevin M. Teeven, Consensual Path to Abolition of Preexisting Duty Rule, 34 Val. U. L. Rev. 43 (1999) (advocating enforcement of modifications <span title="779" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-779">p. 779</span>without requirement of new consideration but subject to policing mechanisms of economic duress, unconscionability, and good faith).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="038ed64b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Historical context.</i> The <i>Alaska Packers’ Assn</i> courts, as well as the commentators discussed above, discounted the possibility that a rational, profit-seeking enterprise would choose not to replace badly depreciated nets, but a careful examination of the case suggests reasons why that might well have happened. In her article, A Fish Story: Alaska Packers’ Association v. Domenico, 2000 Utah L. Rev. 185, Professor Debora L. Threedy reviewed not only the opinions in the <i>Alaska Packers’ Assn</i> trial and appellate decisions, but also explored the salmon fishing and canning industry at the time of the dispute. Among Professor Threedy’s key revelations are the facts that the Pyramid Harbor location was only one of 18 canneries operated by the Association, the canneries purchased fish caught by local native tribes in addition to the catch of the crew, the Association’s crew received lower pay than those at nearby competitors, and that the nets at Pyramid Harbor were in fact partially reused while the other Association canneries purchased new nets each year. Most of her findings supporting the claims of the fishing crew about the substandard nets are capsulated in a critique of the crew’s lawyer. Professor Threedy writes:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="038ed64c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hindsight, of course, has perfect vision, but if Banning [the crew’s lawyer] had focused on the cannery’s capacity and had been able to establish that the 1900 catch met or exceeded the cannery’s capacity, then he would have established a motive for the cannery to limit the fishermen’s catch. Similarly, if he had been able to bring out the disparities between Pyramid Harbor and other canneries in cost per case and expenditures for fishing gear, along with the extent to which Pyramid Harbor relied on the local tribes, he could have suggested a motive to cut corners on the nets. Either strategy would have bolstered the credibility of the fishermen who testified that the nets were substandard. Moreover, if Banning had been able to bring out the extent to which local tribal fishermen contributed to the cannery’s operation, he would have been able to argue that the cannery could have operated even if the fishermen had refused to work during the season.</p>
</div>
<p id="038ed64d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Id. at 214. Without reaching a firm conclusion on the issue, Professor Threedy questions whether the Association in fact might have decided to supply defective or inefficient nets even if that meant its workers had to expend much greater effort in the performance of their duties. It is also notable that in 1902, when <i>Alaska Packers’</i> was decided, the temper of the times (and of the courts) was generally friendly to capital and management, and hostile to labor and collective bargaining. Does the additional information offered by Professor Threedy suggest only that the facts may have been wrongly determined or do they raise concerns about the legal principles applied by the courts?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="038ed64e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Modification of employment contracts. Alaska Packers’</i> <i>Assn</i> can be examined from more than one perspective. If <i>Alaska Packers’</i> is regarded as a “labor” case, that does not mean contract principles could not play their part in resolving the dispute. The prospect of an employee union engaging in a strike to obtain a promise of higher pay played out in Contempo Design v. Chicago <span title="780" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-780">p. 780</span>&amp; Northeast Illinois Dist. Council of Carpenters, 226 F.3d 535 (7th Cir. 2000). Notwithstanding an applicable “no strike” provision within the current contract, the unionized employees struck at a time when the employer was pursuing a multi-year, multi-million-dollar contract with a major new client, Bank of America, and was facing pressure from an overdue loan. The employer agreed to a pay raise and other benefits but reserved its right to sue the union. Relying heavily on <i>Alaska Packers’ Assn</i> to develop federal common law, the court’s majority held that the modified agreement was unenforceable for lack of consideration and noted that the pre-existing duty rule served to “prevent coercive modifications.” Id. at 549-550. The four dissenting judges conceded that the union had the employer “over a barrel” but would have enforced the modified contract because of the view that the union had a good faith, though erroneous, belief that it was not bound by the no strike clause. Id. at 555-557.</p>
<p id="038ed64f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another, more frequent scenario requiring the courts to review the enforceability of a contract modification occurs within the context of non-unionized at-will employment, as typified by the Geysen v. Securitas Security Services case and the following notes in Chapter 6. Frequently these cases will involve an employer’s promises of job security or fair treatment contained in a personnel manual that are deemed to become binding through the unilateral-contract formation process. E.g., Doyle v. Holy Cross Hospital, 708 N.E.2d 1140 (Ill. 1999). If the employer later promulgates a new version of its manual, abrogating those earlier promises, should that revision be viewed as a “one-sided” modification of an existing contract, requiring fresh consideration to be effective? And if so, what could constitute the requisite consideration? Some courts have held that such an attempt by an employer to modify its personnel handbook was ineffective because unsupported by any consideration. E.g., Demasse v. ITT Corp., 984 P.2d 1138 (Ariz. 1999). However, other courts have held that the employee’s continued employment constitutes consideration for the modification. See Pine River State Bank v. Mettille, 333 N.W.2d 622, 626–627 (Minn. 1983). Finally, some courts adopt an intermediate position, allowing modification without any additional consideration but with some restrictions. See Asmus v. Pacific Bell, 999 P.2d 71 (Cal. 2000) (employer may unilaterally terminate announced policy of indefinite duration, if employer makes the change after a reasonable time, on reasonable notice, and without interfering with employees’ vested benefits; given those limitations, no additional consideration is required). See also Bankey v. Storer Broad., 443 N.W.2d 112 (Mich. 1989) (employer may unilaterally replace previous for-cause termination policy with employment at-will with reasonable notice; issue is not one of contract formation but of employment policy).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="038ed650-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Other exceptions to the pre-existing duty rule.</i> As discussed in Note 2, courts generally require that a modification be supported by new consideration on both sides, even if very minimal or slight. Court decisions reveal, however, a number of exceptions to the requirement of new consideration. The first exception is that of “unforeseen circumstances.” This concept is included in Restatement (Second) §89(a) which states that a promise of modification is binding if “fair and equitable in view of circumstances not anticipated by the <span title="781" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-781">p. 781</span>parties when the contract was made.” The concept may be applicable even if the unforeseen circumstances would not fully qualify for excuse based on the impracticability doctrine as discussed in Section B of this chapter. See §89, Illustration 1 (when solid rock unexpectedly encountered making removal nine times more expensive, owner’s promise to pay increased amount for excavation is binding); see also Roussalis v. Wyoming Medical Center, Inc., 4 P.3d 209 (Wyo. 2001) (modification that increased the size of promised medical building would be enforceable without additional consideration in light of need to resolve unforeseen safety concerns not addressed by original architect plans).</p>
<p id="038ed651-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, Restatement (Second) §89(c) recognizes “reliance” on a promised modification as another basis for enforcing a modifying agreement despite the absence of fresh consideration. This is one of several Restatement (Second) provisions in which the principle of §90 is given a more focused application in the context of a particular problem. See generally Charles L. Knapp, Reliance in the Revised <i>Restatement:</i> The Proliferation of Promissory Estoppel, 81 Colum. L. Rev. 52 (1981). What kind of reliance will serve this purpose? Should it be sufficient to make a modification binding that the party seeking enforcement of the modification has “relied” by performing its duties as promised under the original agreement? Neither the comments nor illustrations to §89 are particularly helpful on this issue. The cited article suggests that in light of the apparent intention of §89 to liberalize the consideration requirement for such modifying agreements, the answer may be that simply to perform as originally promised might constitute such reliance as would satisfy §89(c). It seems possible that the drafters of Restatement (Second) §89 would have really preferred to take the approach of UCC §2-209(1) in largely dismissing the pre-existing duty rule, as discussed in the case and notes which follow, but felt unable to make such a complete break with the common law tradition on this point.</p>
<p id="038ed652-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, many courts also recognize the concept of “mutual release” as another exception to the pre-existing duty rule. In Schwartzreich v. Bauman-Basch, Inc., 131 N.E. 887 (N.Y. 1921), an employee, originally hired as a coat designer for a fixed period at a stated salary, was promised an increase in pay when he reported to his employer that another firm had offered him a higher salary to come with it. The parties tore up their old contract and replaced it with a new one, providing for the promised increase. The employee was later discharged and sued to recover damages based on the increased salary rate. The New York Court of Appeals held that the new contract could be upheld as being the product of a mutual rescission, followed by a new and valid contract. But as the Restatement (Second) points out, in Comment <i>b</i> to §89, such a rationale is “fictitious” when the “rescission” and new contract are simultaneous (as they were in <i>Schwartzreich</i>). Despite the legal sleight-of-hand involved in its decision, <i>Schwartzreich</i> might nevertheless be justified as a case in which the element of coercion was absent and circumstances had changed unexpectedly (the employee later discovered his services were worth more on the market than he had originally anticipated), and the employee had justifiably relied on <span title="782" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-782">p. 782</span>the promise of a raise (at least by remaining instead of choosing to breach, and possibly also by increased devotion to his efforts on his employer’s behalf). See also Margeson v. Artis, 776 N.W. 2d 652, 656 n.4 (Iowa 2009) (parties are free to rescind contract and then form new contract with same consideration being given by one side).</p></li>

<p id="038efd6b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is a breach of contract case. Plaintiff, Kelsey-Hayes Company (Kelsey-Hayes), alleges defendant, Galtaco Redlaw Castings Corporation (Galtaco), breached a three-year agreement (the 1987 contract) for the purchase of castings. In addition to the damages allegedly suffered as a result of the breach of the 1987 contract, Kelsey-Hayes seeks a declaratory judgment that it does not have to pay Galtaco price increases to which it agreed in 1989. Kelsey-Hayes asserts the 1989 contract modifications (1989 agreements) containing the price increases (1) were agreed to by Kelsey-Hayes under duress, (2) were unconscionable, (3) were demanded by Galtaco in bad faith and (4) constitute unjust enrichment to Galtaco. Galtaco says in response that Kelsey-Hayes waived its breach of contract claims and, in addition, argues that the defenses Kelsey-Hayes raises regarding the validity of the 1989 agreements have no merit. Galtaco also counterclaims for the monies owed under the 1989 agreements. Also before the Court is Kelsey-Hayes’ motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a).</p>
<p id="038efd6c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Galtaco has moved for summary judgment, Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, on Kelsey-Hayes’ claims and its counterclaim. For the reasons which follow, Galtaco’s motion will be denied. In addition, the Court will grant Kelsey-Hayes’ motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.</p>

<p id="038efd6e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The following facts as gleaned from the affidavits, deposition testimony and documents in the record are not in dispute.</p>
<p id="038efd6f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Kelsey-Hayes makes brake assemblies that it sells to auto manufacturers, including Chrysler and Ford. For several years prior to 1987, Galtaco supplied castings to Kelsey-Hayes which incorporated them into the brake assemblies. In 1987, Galtaco and Kelsey-Hayes signed a three-year “requirements” contract. Under the contract, Galtaco was to be the sole source to Kelsey-Hayes of certain types of castings through April 1990. In return, Galtaco was to charge fixed prices for 1987, and scheduled price reductions for 1988 and 1989, respectively. . . .<span title="783" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-783">p. 783</span></p>
<p id="038efd70-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>A.</b></p>
<p id="038efd71-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By the spring of 1989, Galtaco had been experiencing continued monetary losses for several years. Kelsey-Hayes was aware of Galtaco’s financial condition. For the seven months ending in April 1989, Galtaco’s foundry operations had losses totalling $2,410,000. As a result, on May 10, 1989, Galtaco’s Board of Directors made final a decision to discontinue its foundry operations and cease production of castings. Galtaco recognized that an immediate shut down of its foundry operations would seriously inconvenience its customers, because they would need additional castings before they could cover from other sources. Therefore, Galtaco offered all of its customers, including Kelsey-Hayes, an agreement to keep its foundries operating for “several months” in exchange for price increase of 30 percent effective with shipments of May 15, 1989.</p>
<p id="038efd72-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If Galtaco were to have immediately terminated its foundry operations, Kelsey-Hayes concluded that it would not have been able to obtain a sufficient supply of castings from alternative sources for 18-24 weeks. As a result, Kelsey-Hayes determined that declining to accept Galtaco’s offer would have the effect of shutting down the assembly plants of two of its major clients, Chrysler and Ford. Kelsey-Hayes was Ford’s sole source of certain brake assemblies, and Ford had no significant bank of those parts. Any interruption of the supply of brake assemblies longer than five to ten days would likely have resulted in the halting of Ford production of a vehicle line. On May 12, 1989, Kelsey-Hayes accepted Galtaco’s offer to continue supplying castings for a time, at a 30 percent price increase for all castings delivered to all plants. Before entering into the 1989 agreements, Kelsey-Hayes did not reserve any rights under the 1987 contract when it accepted Galtaco’s offer.</p>
<p id="038efd73-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On June 9, 1989, Galtaco informed Kelsey-Hayes it required an additional 30 percent price increase in order to keep its foundry operations going. By this time, Galtaco’s other customers had found alternative sources of castings. The additional price increase was asked for to offset the rising fixed costs Galtaco would continue to incur if it were to remain in operation for Kelsey-Hayes’ sole benefit. Since Kelsey-Hayes had not yet found another source for castings, it accepted Galtaco’s offer to continue providing castings for an additional 30 percent price increase. Again, Kelsey-Hayes did not reserve any rights under the 1987 contract when it entered into the June 1989 agreement.</p>
<p id="038f2384-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>B.</b></p>
<p id="038f2385-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Between May 15 and August 30, 1989, Galtaco made 282 shipments to Kelsey-Hayes. Galtaco’s foundries closed down after the final shipment to Kelsey-Hayes.</p>
<p id="038f2386-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Kelsey-Hayes accepted all of the shipments, and it timely paid for the first 197 deliveries according to the terms of the 1989 agreements. However, Kelsey-Hayes failed to pay Galtaco for 84 of the remaining 85 casting shipments. The price for the 84 shipments for which Kelsey-Hayes has not paid approximates the $2 million price increase to which Kelsey-Hayes agreed under the 1989 agreements.</p>
<p id="038f2387-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At no time did Kelsey-Hayes explicitly state that it would sue Galtaco; however, Kelsey-Hayes did strenuously protest Galtaco’s actions as a breach of the 1987 contract.</p>

<p id="038f2389-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As stated, supra, Kelsey-Hayes’ claim is based on several alternative theories of liability. However, in order to dispose of the pending motion, the Court must only decide whether Kelsey-Hayes has presented enough evidence to allow a reasonable finder of the facts to conclude the 1989 agreements were executed under duress.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10B51_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10B51_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">4</a></span></p>

<p id="038f238c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Galtaco says Kelsey-Hayes cannot sue for breach of the 1987 contract, because it entered into the superseding 1989 agreements. It is true that under Michigan law, entering a superseding, inconsistent agreement covering the same subject matter rescinds an earlier contract and operates as a waiver of any claim for breach of the earlier contract not expressly reserved. Joseph v. Rottschafer, 248 Mich. 606, 610-611, 227 N.W. 784 (1929); Culver v. Castro, 126 Mich. App. 824, 827-828, 338 N.W.2d 232 (1983). However, a subsequent contract or modification is invalid and therefore does not supersede an earlier contract when the subsequent contract was entered into under duress. Lafayette Dramatic Production v. Ferentz, 305 Mich. 193, 217-219, 9 N.W.2d 57 (1943). There is sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable finder of the facts to determine that Kelsey-Hayes was under duress when it executed the 1989 agreements. Thus, Galtaco’s motion for summary judgment will be denied.</p>
<p id="038f238d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>B.</b></p>
<p id="038f238e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts in Michigan have recognized the doctrine of economic duress or “business compulsion” for more than a century. Hackley v. Headley, 45 Mich. 569, 8 N.W. 511 (1881). Galtaco relies on early statutory and judicial general expressions of the doctrine stating that in order to make a claim of duress, a person must be subjected to the threat of an unlawful act in the nature of a tort or a crime. See Burke v. Gould, 105 Cal. 277, 281-283, 38 P. 733 (1894). However, the doctrine of duress has been greatly expanded since its common-law origin.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10B6A_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10B6A_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">5</a></span> Now, a contract is voidable if a party’s manifestation of assent is induced by an improper threat by another party that leaves the victim no reasonable alternative. Rich &amp; Whillock v. Ashton Development, 157 Cal. App. 3d 1154, 204 Cal. Rptr. 86, 89 (1984); Systems Technology Associates, Inc. v. United States, 699 F.2d 1383, 1387 (Fed. Cir. 1983); Restatement (Second) of Contracts, §175(1) (1982). In other words, economic duress can exist in the absence of an illegal threat; the threat must merely be wrongful. Even acts lawful and non-tortious may be wrongful depending on the <span title="785" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-785">p. 785</span>circumstances. S. Williston &amp; W. Jaeger, Williston on Contracts §1606 (3rd ed. 1972); Fowler v. Mumford, 48 Del. 282, 102 A.2d 535 (Del. Super. 1954).</p>

<p id="038f4aa3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Kelsey-Hayes has alleged wrongful acts of Galtaco in its complaint and has offered proof of them in affidavits. Specifically, Kelsey-Hayes says Galtaco threatened to breach its contract and go out of business, stopping production and delivery of castings, unless Kelsey-Hayes agreed to significant price hikes. Austin Instrument, Inc. v. Loral Corp., 29 N.Y.2d 124, 324 N.Y.S.2d 22, 272 N.E.2d 533 (1971) (threat by one party to breach contract by not delivering required items is wrongful).</p>

<p id="038f4aa5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Kelsey-Hayes has also presented a triable issue of fact that it had no reasonable alternative other than acquiescing to Galtaco’s demand for a contract modification. Affidavits and deposition testimony in the record show Kelsey-Hayes contacted six other casting manufacturers, but none were able to immediately provide an alternate source of castings to meet Kelsey-Hayes’ delivery requirements.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10B95_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10B95_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">6</a></span> As a result, Kelsey-Hayes might reasonably have believed a brief interruption in casting shipments would force at least one of its major customers, Ford, to halt production of a vehicle line. Such an occurrence, Kelsey-Hayes could reasonably fear, would injure its business reputation and subject it to large monetary damages.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10B9B_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10B9B_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">7</a></span> The facts in this case parallel <i>Austin Instrument,</i> supra, in which a government contractor faced a genuine possibility of substantial liquidated damages as a result of a subcontractor’s threat to stop deliveries unless prices were increased. In <i>Austin Instrument,</i> 324 N.Y.S.2d at 26-27, 272 N.E.2d at 537-538, the court held that a company in this position was deprived of its free will and had no alternative other than acquiescing to the demands of the party threatening to breach its contract. Similarly, faced with the imminent shutdown of its major customer’s plants, Kelsey-Hayes may have had no alternative other than agreeing to Galtaco’s “requests” for price increases.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BA7_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10BA7_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">8</a></span> See also Pittsburgh <span title="786" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-786">p. 786</span>Steel Co. v.

<p id="038f4aaa-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is hardly necessary to add that Kelsey-Hayes’ normal legal remedy of accepting Galtaco’s breach of the contract and then suing for damages would have been inadequate under the circumstances. Kelsey-Hayes might reasonably have feared that if it shunned the 1989 agreements and instead sued for breach of the 1987 contract then Galtaco would have stopped supplying it with castings.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BBA_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10BBA_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">9</a></span> As stated, supra, evidence in the record strongly suggests Kelsey-Hayes would not have been able to locate an alternate supply of castings. As a result, Kelsey-Hayes’ business reputation may have suffered and its major customers may have been forced to shut down its automobile production lines.</p>

<p id="038f71be-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In order to state a claim of economic duress a buyer coerced into executing a modification to an existing agreement must “at least display some protest against the higher price in order to put the seller on notice that the modification is not freely entered into.” United States v. Progressive Enterprises, 418 F. Supp. 662, 665 (E.D. Va. 1976) (in contract modification situations, the parties must be able to rely on objective, unequivocal manifestations of assent). Galtaco says Kelsey-Hayes executed the 1989 agreements with the secret intention to never pay the higher prices. However, it is undisputed Kelsey-Hayes vigorously objected to Galtaco’s breach of the 1987 contract and its demand for price increases. While Kelsey-Hayes did not expressly reserve the right to sue under the 1987 contract, a reasonable trier of the facts could determine its protests effectively put Galtaco on notice that the 1989 agreements were agreed to under duress.</p>
<p id="038f71bf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>D.</b></p>
<p id="038f71c0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Galtaco argues, in effect, that the common law doctrine of economic duress no longer applies to cases like the one at bar. Instead, Galtaco says, the doctrine has been subsumed by the Uniform Commercial Code’s “good faith” test, M.C.L. §440.2209, for determining the enforceability of agreements modifying contracts for the sale of goods. This contention is frivolous. Galtaco relies on a single case, Roth Steel Products v. Sharon Steel Corp., 705 F.2d 134 (6th Cir. 1983), to support its contention that a well-established tenet of law has been abandoned. Moreover, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in <i>Roth Steel</i> never even held that a person can no longer rely on the doctrine of economic duress to invalidate a contract modification. Finally, M.C.L. §440.1103 states that, absent explicit language to the contrary, the Uniform Commercial Code merely supplements the common law of duress and coercion. M.C.L. §440.2209 contains no such language. . . . </p>

<li class=""><p id="038f71c6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Modification without consideration under Article 2.</i> The judge writing the opinion in <i>Kelsey-Hayes</i> never raises the pre-existing duty rule as a possible reason for denying effect to the modification. The judge’s discussion at the beginning of section IIIA. may be read to suggest that this case is an example of mutual rescission followed by a new agreement, as discussed in Note 6 after the <i>Alaska Packers’</i> case. In any event, the court’s citation to Michigan’s version of the Uniform Commercial Code indicates that this case falls under UCC §2-209(1), which states that a modification “needs no consideration to be binding.” The drafters of the UCC appear to be expressing the view that parties regularly modify agreements without having new consideration on both sides, and that such “one-sided” modifications should be routinely enforced except in the presence of special circumstances. Do people in business indeed routinely agree to such one-sided modifications, and if so, why? Consider Comment 1 to §2-209: “This section seeks to . . . make effective all necessary and desirable modifications of sales contracts without regard to the technicalities which at present hamper such adjustments.” A comprehensive survey of the Code’s approach to contract modification can be found in two studies by Professor Robert Hillman: Policing Contract Modifications under the UCC: Good Faith and the Doctrine of Economic Duress, 64 Iowa L. Rev. 849 (1979); A Study of Uniform Commercial Code Methodology: Contract Modification under Article Two, 59 N.C. L. Rev. 335 (1981). Professor Irma S. Russell also provided a critique of §2-209 in her article, Reinventing the Deal: A Sequential Approach to Analyzing Claims for Enforcement of Modified Sales Contracts, 53 Fla. L. Rev. 49 (2001).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="038f71c7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Good faith as a limitation on modification under Article 2.</i> Assuming that the drafters of the UCC were right to take the position that one-sided contract modifications are by and large an everyday affair, there remains the question of how the law can “police” against the possibility that one party will exploit developing circumstances to coerce the other party’s agreement to a modification. While §2-209(1) itself does not directly address that issue, Comment 2 provides that the obligation of good faith serves as a bar to “extortion” of a modifying agreement “without legitimate commercial reason.” In a case discussed briefly at the end of the <i>Kelsey-Hayes</i> opinion, the Court of Appeals in Roth Steel Products v. Sharon Steel Corp., 705 F.2d 134 (6th Cir. 1983), upheld a district court’s determination that a price-increase modification was unenforceable because it had been procured by bad faith. The <i>Roth</i> court applied a two-part test. First, it declared that a party may in good faith seek a modification when “unforeseen economic exigencies existed which would prompt an ordinary merchant to seek a modification in order to avoid a loss on the contract.” Second, it held that even where circumstances do justify asking for a modification, it is nevertheless bad faith <span title="788" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-788">p. 788</span>conduct to attempt to <i>coerce</i> one, by threatening a breach. On this point, the court conceded that the inference of bad faith arising when a breach is threatened may be rebutted by a showing that the party threatening not to perform did honestly believe it had a legal defense to the duty of performance. In <i>Roth</i>, however, the court held that the inference of bad faith had not been rebutted, principally because it appeared that the legal justification for nonperformance was not offered at the time the modification was sought but only as an afterthought in the context of litigation. This, the court held, was not the “honesty in fact” that the UCC good faith obligation requires. 705 F.2d 145-148.</p>
<p id="038f71c8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Man Indus. (India), Ltd. v. Midcontinent Express Pipeline, LLC, 407 S.W.3d 342 (Tex. App. 2013), the court agreed generally with the <i>Roth</i> court’s two-part test of objective reasonableness and subjective honesty. However, the court rejected the <i>Roth</i> requirement that the change in conditions be unforeseeable, quoting Comment 2 to §2-609, which states: “But such matters as a market shift which makes performance come to involve a loss may provide such a reason <i>even though there is no such unforeseen difficulty</i> as would make out a legal excuse from performance under Sections 2-615 and 2-616.” (emphasis added). Under the <i>Roth-Man</i> test, should the modification agreement asserted by Galtaco be regarded as the product of bad faith?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="038f98d9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Economic duress as a limitation on modification under Article 2.</i> We have already seen, in connection with the <i>Totem Marine</i> case in Chapter 7, that economic duress may generally be grounds under the common law for avoiding an agreement. The <i>Kelsey-Hayes</i> court holds that UCC §2-209(1) does not preclude application of the duress doctrine to sales of goods cases, and observes that modern formulations of the duress doctrine no longer require the presence of an “illegal” threat. As also reflected in the <i>Totem Marine</i> case, most courts now accept that a “wrongful” threat may leave a party without reasonable alternatives and thereby invoke duress as grounds to excuse enforcement of a contract. Thus, the <i>Kelsey-Hayes</i> court anticipated that the Michigan Supreme Court would adopt the modern view of duress if confronted with the question and move away from its early statements which required an illegal threat. The Michigan Supreme Court, however, appears not to have confronted that issue since the time of <i>Kelsey-Hayes</i> and the intermediate state appellate opinions still require an illegal threat. See Whirlpool Corp. v. Grigoleit Co., 713 F.3d 316 (6th Cir. 2013) (observing that Michigan law differs from other states and still requires a showing of illegality to establish duress). If the judge in <i>Kelsey-Hayes</i> had deemed state law to require an “illegal” threat to establish duress, would that change lead to a different outcome in the case? If so, would you agree with that resolution of the case?</p>
<p id="038f98da-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In footnote 4 the <i>Kelsey-Hayes</i> opinion summarily held that a claim of bad faith was not supported, while at the same time accepting the argument that the modification may have been the result of economic duress, citing Austin Instrument, Inc. v. Loral Corp., perhaps the leading modern case for this type of duress. While it seems likely that where contract modification is at issue, the law of “duress” and the law of “good faith” will often tend to merge, the two theories may involve somewhat different considerations. See Meredith R. Miller, Revisiting Austin v. Loral: A Study in Economic Duress, Contract Modification and Framing, 2 Hastings Bus. L.J. 357, 411 (2006) (noting that good faith <span title="789" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-789">p. 789</span>analysis would focus more on a party’s reasons for seeking and the fairness of a proposed modification whereas duress analysis looks at alleged threat and lack of choices). Other cases have considered the issues of duress and good faith in the context of an Article 2 case, though claimants seem to succeed only rarely. See, e.g., Sonfast Corp. v. York International Corp., 875 F. Supp. 1099 (M.D. Pa. 1995) (finding neither economic duress nor breach of duty of good faith in making modification; buyer could have insisted on seller honoring existing contract, and had adequate legal remedy if it did not); Gross Valentino Printing Co. v. Clarke, 458 N.E.2d 1027 (Ill. App. Ct. 1983) (claimant failed to establish economic duress; no evidence that alleged threat was sufficient to overcome the will of claimant and failed to show legal redress was inadequate).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="038f98db-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Protest of a bad faith modification.</i> If ties of good faith bind each party to the other under the UCC (and under general contract law as well; see Restatement (Second) §205), they bind not only the party seeking to enforce a modification but also the one who would resist it. In <i>Kelsey-Hayes,</i> the buyer at first performed under the modification, but later repudiated it; the seller pointed to this as evidence that the buyer had acted with a “secret intention to never pay the higher prices,” suggesting that this might amount to bad faith on the buyer’s part. Some courts in similar cases have held that the party agreeing to an assertedly coerced modification has a good faith duty to make plain that it is acting under protest, so that the other party will not be deceived as to its intention eventually to resist enforcement or seek redress. E.g., United States ex rel. Crane Co. v. Progressive Enterprises, Inc., 418 F. Supp. 662 (E.D. Va. 1976) (buyer’s secret intention never to pay higher price not in keeping with good faith’s requirement of “honesty in fact”); but cf. T &amp; S Brass &amp; Bronze Works, Inc. v. Pic-Air, Inc., 790 F.2d 1098 (4th Cir. 1986) (buyer’s failure to make formal protest did not bar later objection to modification; <i>Crane</i> distinguished as applying only where other party had acted in good faith in seeking modification). Did the court in <i>Kelsey-Hayes</i> appropriately resolve this issue in the buyer’s favor?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="038f98dc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Revisiting Problem 8-4.</i> Recall the questions posed in Problem 8-4, above. If Associated Department Stores were now to agree to pay Waller Brothers an increased amount for the installation of tile in its department store, would that agreement be supported by consideration? Does it need to be? Could enforcement of such an agreement be avoided on grounds of bad faith or duress (or any other ground we have studied, such as fraud, mistake, or undue influence)? To answer these questions, do you need more facts? What facts would you need, and how might they be discovered?</p></li>

(“MRI”) breached its contract with Brookside to purchase 91,000 pounds of fresh basil leaves. <span title="790" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-790">p. 790</span>Before the Court now are Plaintiff’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment. For the reasons discussed below, the Court finds that Defendant’s Motion is denied and Plaintiff’s Motion is granted in part and denied in part.</p>
<p id="038fbff5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b><span class="epub-small-caps">Background</span></b></p>
<p id="038fbff6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On October 13, 1993, Brookside Farms and MRI entered into a requirements contract for the sale of fresh basil leaves from Brookside to MRI. Under the contract, MRI agreed to buy a minimum of 91,000 pounds of fresh basil leaves for a one-year term. Delivery was to be made daily, five days per week, in lots ranging from a minimum of 350 pounds to a maximum of 800 pounds. MRI agreed to pay for the basil it accepted within fifteen days of delivery date.</p>
<p id="038fbff7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The price for the basil leaves under the contract was seasonally based, with one price applicable during the domestic growing season, and a higher price applicable during the non-growing season, when Brookside would look to Mexican growers to supply the basil it would need to fulfill its obligations under the contract. The original price for basil delivered during the domestic growing season — between June 1 and September 30 — was $3.80 per pound; the original price for basil delivered during the non-growing season — October 1 to May 31 — was $5.00 per pound.</p>
<p id="038fbff8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is undisputed that Mike Franklin, the vice-president of MRI, requested Wayde Burt, Brookside’s general partner, to remove additional parts of the stems of the basil leaves, a task not specifically required under the original contract. Brookside agreed to do this work in exchange for a $0.50 per pound increase for the remainder of the contract term. The undisputed testimony shows that, because the original contract contained a clause forbidding oral modification, Franklin promised to make a notation of future price changes on MRI’s copy of the original contract. The new price terms were also reflected on MRI’s internally-generated purchase orders, Brookside’s invoices, and MRI’s payment checks. Between October 27, 1993, and November 16, 1993, MRI issued twelve separate purchase orders for shipments of basil at $5.50 per pound, and Brookside filled each order and invoiced MRI at the new price.</p>
<p id="038fbff9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Between November 17, 1993, and January 9, 1994, MRI discontinued its order of basil leaves, and Brookside reduced its purchase of basil from its Mexican suppliers as a result. Consequently, Brookside was forced to pay higher prices for its supply of Mexican basil leaves when MRI resumed its orders under the contract. Two price modifications in the contract then followed in close sequence. Initially, Franklin and Burt agreed that MRI would pay $6.23 [sic] per pound for imported basil. Between January 10 and January 21, 1994, MRI issued fifteen separate purchase orders for shipments of basil at $6.25 per pound, and Brookside filled each order and invoiced MRI at that price. MRI paid all these invoices at the higher price. In mid-January, MRI agreed to pay $6.75 per pound for the basil Brookside imported from Mexico and issued sixty-seven separate purchase orders for shipments at that price. Each of these shipments was filled and paid without protest.</p>
<p id="038fbffa-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Between March 14, 1994, and May 17, 1994, MRI issued twenty-one purchase orders for basil at $6.75 per pound and issued a check to Brookside for <span title="791" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-791">p. 791</span>$10,260 in payment for eight of those invoices. Unfortunately for both parties, this check was dishonored by MRI’s bank for insufficient funds. Brookside has brought this suit on the claims that Defendant has breached the executory portion of the contract by refusing to accept the minimum amount of basil it agreed to and that Defendant is also liable to Plaintiff for the 3,041 pounds of basil it accepted but did not pay for. MRI contends that no payment is due because Brookside itself breached the contract by raising prices in violation of the contract’s express language that no modification would be binding unless it was reduced to written form. . . . </p>
<p id="038fbffb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b><span class="epub-small-caps">Analysis</span></b></p>
<p id="038fbffc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>The Price Modification Issue</b></p>
<p id="038fbffd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The parties in this case vigorously dispute the question of whether they entered into a valid modification of the price of fresh basil leaves. Plaintiff has submitted undisputed affidavit testimony that several oral agreements to modify the original contract price for basil occurred. Within one week of the contract’s formation, MRI discovered that the stems on the basil leaves would need to be removed before they could be properly used — a task not required by the original contract. As stated above, MRI’s vice-president contacted Plaintiff’s general partner, and both parties agreed that Plaintiff would remove the basil stems before shipping the leaves and increase the purchase price by $0.50 per pound.</p>
<p id="038fbffe-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both parties were aware that the contract contained a clause forbidding oral modifications of the contract’s terms. Section 19 of the contract states:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="038fbfff-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Agreement may be modified only by a writing signed by the party against whom or against whose successors and assigns enforcement of the modification is sought.</p>
</div>
<p id="038fc000-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consequently, MRI’s vice-president agreed to make a notation of the price change on MRI’s copy of the original contract. (See Burt Affidavit, Instrument #7, at 2). Several subsequent price hikes were also agreed to by the parties, and MRI accepted and paid for 21,389 pounds of basil at purchase prices ranging from the original price to $6.75 per pound and accepted, but refused to pay for, an additional 3,041 pounds.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10CDD_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10CDD_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">1</a></span> Plaintiff currently seeks payment on this 3,041 pounds of basil at the purchase price of $6.75 per pound. MRI contends that no payment is due because Plaintiff itself breached the contract by raising prices in violation of the contract’s express language that no modification would be binding unless it was reduced to written form. The Court disagrees.</p>
<p id="038fe712-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Neither party in this case has properly pointed out that the contract in dispute falls within the Statute of Frauds under §2.201 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code. That statute provides that “a contract for the sale of goods for the price of $500 or more is not enforceable by way of action or defense unless there is some writing sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale has <span title="792" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-792">p. 792</span>been made between the parties and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought.” Clearly, the original contract between MRI and Brookside meets these requirements.</p>
<p id="038fe713-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is a general rule of Texas law that oral agreements that materially modify a written agreement within the Statute of Frauds are not enforceable. Tex. Bus. &amp; Comm. Code Ann. §26.01; King v. Texacally Joint Venture, 690 S.W.2d 618, 619 (Tx. App. — Austin, 1985, writ ref’d n.r.e.); Dracopoulas v. Rachal, 411 S.W.2d 719 (Tex. 1967). However, not all modifications are prohibited. If the oral changes do not materially alter the underlying obligations, for example, they are not barred. Horner v. Bourland, 724 F.2d 1142, 1148 (5th Cir. 1984); Group Hospital Services, Inc. v. One and Two Brookriver Center, 704 S.W.2d 886, 890 (Tx. App. — Dallas, 1986, n.w.h.). Second, the Texas Supreme Court has adopted the doctrine of promissory estoppel in some cases to forbid reliance on the Statute of Frauds as a defense to the validity of oral agreements. In specific, the Court has held that where one party reasonably relies on the oral promise of another to reduce an oral agreement to writing, the failure to create such a writing will not prevent the relying party from taking the modification out of the Statute of Frauds.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10CED_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10CED_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">2</a></span> “Moore” Burger, Inc. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 492 S.W.2d 934, 937 (Tex. 1972); see also, Foster v. Mutual Savings Assoc., 602 S.W.2d 98, 101 (Tx. App. — Ft. Worth, 1980, n.w.h.).</p>
<p id="038fe716-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, both parties in this case have also failed to note that Texas has adopted an exception to the Statute of Frauds contained in the Uniform Commercial Code. Sections 2.201(c) &amp; (c)(3) of the Tex. Bus. &amp; Comm. Code state in part that:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="038fe717-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(c) A contract which does not satisfy the requirements of Subsection (a) [the general Statute of Frauds provision] but which is valid in other respects is enforceable</p>
<p id="038fe718-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . .</p>
<p id="038fe719-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(3) with respect to goods for which payment has been made and accepted or which have been received and accepted.</p>
</div>
<p id="038fe71a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, an oral modification that would itself form a binding contract in the absence of Statute of Frauds considerations can be binding on the parties to a sale of goods over $500 insofar as specific goods have been received and accepted. See Tex. Bus. &amp; Comm. Code §2.209.</p>
<p id="038fe71b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court finds that a valid oral modification of the contract between MRI and Brookside occurred on both estoppel and statutory grounds. As stated above, it is undisputed that the parties agreed to alter the purchase price of the basil leaves. On each occasion, MRI issued separate purchase orders and <span title="793" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-793">p. 793</span>Brookside filled each order and invoiced MRI on the price. In each case, MRI paid the invoiced price without protest. At the time the first price modification occurred, MRI’s vice-president and Brookside’s general partner discussed whether or not they needed to redraw the contract to account for the price changes in light of the fact that the contract did not allow for oral modifications. It is undisputed that MRI’s vice-president assured Plaintiff that he would make a notation of price changes on MRI’s copy of the contract and that this notation would be sufficient. (See Burt Affidavit, at 2).</p>
<p id="038fe71c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court finds that such behavior clearly brings these parties within the estoppel theory adopted by the Texas Supreme Court in <i>“Moore” Burger,</i> 492 S.W.2d at 937. The promised notation would have constituted a valid written modification of the contract’s terms. A valid writing under the Statute of Frauds requires only “some writing” signed by the party against whom it is to be enforced, namely, MRI. Tex. Bus. &amp; Comm. Code §2.201(a). In addition, given that the intent of the oral agreement to modify the written form of the contract was clearly designed to bring it within the controlling language of the contract, Plaintiff could have reasonably relied on Defendant’s implied promise to initial or sign the price change to indicate its intent to adopt the change; without such an implied promise, MRI’s agreement to alter the written price terms would have been a mere fraud on the Plaintiff. Comment 6 to §2.201(a) makes clear that such a writing need not be delivered to any other party; MRI could have made the notation on its signed copy of the contract and retained possession of it. It is also clear that MRI’s promise to do so induced Brookside Farms to continue shipping basil leaves at the agreed price changes.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10D1E_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10D1E_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">3</a></span></p>
<p id="038fe71e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Based on these actions, the Court finds that MRI cannot now invoke the no-oral-modification clause of the contract to bar Plaintiff’s claim that a valid modification occurred in this case. To do so would be to reach the inequitable result that thousands of dollars could change hands over an extended period of commercial dealings between the parties, during which the Defendant knowingly and wilfully refrained from acting on the promise that induced the Plaintiff to continue shipments and then object to the course of dealing only when it has issued a bad check. The Court notes that the Uniform Commercial Code, which governs the transaction in question, has codified the contractual duty of good faith and fair dealing in commercial settings like the one presently before the Court. Tex. Bus. &amp; Comm. Code §1.203 [now §1.304] provides that “[e]very contract or duty within this title imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance or enforcement.” Where the party is a merchant, its standard of good faith performance requires honesty in fact and the observance of <span title="794" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-794">p. 794</span>reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade. Adolph Coors Co. v. Rodriguez, 780 S.W.2d 477, 481 (Tx. App. — Corpus Christi, 1989, writ denied).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10D29_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10D29_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">4</a></span> For the Court to allow Defendant to invoke the no-oral-modification clause after MRI itself induced and participated in the extended course of action it now complains of would be to convert the sale of basil leaves into a “basil sale carcinoma” that would devour all reasonable commercial standards of behavior between merchants.</p>
<p id="03900e30-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court also finds that a valid modification of the contract’s price terms occurred on statutory grounds. As stated above, oral modifications to contracts within the Statute of Frauds are generally forbidden. In addition, the Texas Business and Commerce Code specifically provides that signed contracts that exclude modifications that are not in the form of signed writings are valid in this state. Tex. Bus. &amp; Comm. Code §2.209(b). Nevertheless, comment 4 to §2.209 clearly states that such provisions do not limit the “actual later conduct” of parties that have entered into non-written modifications, despite a contract’s provision that all modifications must be in writing. In this case, it is undisputed that the “actual later conduct” of these parties involved the order, shipment, and acceptance of 24,430 pounds of basil leaves, 3,041 pounds of which were paid for by a bad check on MRI’s part.</p>
<p id="03900e31-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nevertheless, MRI argues that under the contract’s “no waiver” clause, it did not waive its right to insist on the contract’s initial terms and that, therefore, it now continues to have the right to demand that all modifications to this contract have been in writing to be valid. The Court disagrees.</p>
<p id="03900e32-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 21 of the contract in question states:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03900e33-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The failure of either party to this Agreement to demand full performance of any of its provisions by the other party shall not constitute a waiver of performance unless the party failing to demand performance states in a writing signed by party that the party is waiving that performance. The waiver of any breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement by the parties shall not constitute a continuing waiver or a waiver of any subsequent breach by either party of the same or any other provision of this Agreement.</p>
</div>
<p id="03900e34-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment, Instrument # 12, Exhibit A, at 4). The Court agrees with MRI that this “no-waiver” clause protects Defendant from a waiver of the “no-oral-modification” clause of the contract. Indeed, comment 4 of §2.209, quoted above, explicitly relies on the theory that “later conduct” of the parties to a contract “waives” contractual obligations. By agreeing that a failure to demand full performance does not give rise to a waiver, the parties in this case have effectively agreed to their own private Statute of Frauds for modifying the contract. As comment 3 of Tex. Bus. &amp; Comm. Code §2.209 states, agreements to modify a contract’s terms only in written form “permits the parties in effect to make their own Statute of Frauds as regards any future <span title="795" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-795">p. 795</span>modification of the contract. . . .” Like the general Statute of Frauds, §2.209(b) is designed “to protect against false allegations of oral modifications.” Id.</p>
<p id="03900e35-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, this does <i>not</i> protect MRI under these facts. Indeed, in one sense it destroys MRI’s entire case, for if the failure to object to full performance reserves the right to demand such performance, then Brookside’s failure to object to MRI’s initial request for de-stemmed leaves reserves Plaintiff’s right to demand full performance of the original contract’s terms, which apparently allowed basil to be shipped with stems still attached. More importantly, however, the private Statute of Frauds provision of the contract must be analyzed under the rules otherwise applicable to general Statute of Frauds issues, and under this analysis, the Court finds that the parties have entered into an effective agreement for those items Brookside shipped and MRI received and accepted.</p>
<p id="03900e36-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sections 2.201(c) and (c)(3) of the Texas Business and Commerce Code provide:</p>

<p id="03900e3a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This provision also governs the private Statute of Frauds contained in the contract before the Court. Assuming arguendo that the agreement between MRI and Brookside to modify the contract’s terms did not meet the writing requirements of §2.201(a), §2.201(c) operates to bring the oral agreement within the Statute with respect to those goods MRI actually received and accepted, that is, the 24,430 pounds of basil Brookside shipped, including the 3,041 pounds of unpaid-for basil leaves. See Bagby Land and Cattle Co. v. California Livestock Commission Co., 439 F.2d 315, 317 (5th Cir. 1971) (“receipt and acceptance either of goods or of the price constitutes an unambiguous overt admission by both parties that a contract actually exists.”). Under the specific language of §2.201(c), the new contractual price terms were not made enforceable as to future shipments of basil by Brookside, but they are enforceable as to the 3,041 pounds shipped under the agreed price of $6.75 per pound.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10D66_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10D66_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">5</a></span></p>

<p id="0390354d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff also claims that MRI’s refusal to accept and pay for the minimum amount of basil it agreed to buy in its requirements contract with Plaintiff <span title="796" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-796">p. 796</span>constitutes a breach of contract, with the resulting damages to be determined at trial at a later date. In response, MRI claims that it was relieved of any obligation to purchase basil by Brookside’s demand for higher prices than provided for in the contract. Having already decided that Plaintiff’s price increases were legally justified, the Court now finds that for the same reasons articulated above, Brookside did not breach its contractual obligations and that MRI is liable for a material breach of its obligation to purchase a total of 91,000 pounds of basil from Plaintiff. Consequently, Plaintiff’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is granted on this point. . . . </p>

For the same reasons, Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment is denied on all counts, including its counterclaim that MRI is entitled to recover overpayments from Plaintiff for the amounts it paid for basil. Defendant’s counterclaim for overpayment is also hereby dismissed with prejudice. All relief not specifically granted herein is also denied.

<li class=""><p id="03903553-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Modifications and the statute of frauds.</i> The first two cases in this section examined primarily the question whether contract modifications must be supported by new consideration and when they will be vulnerable to the defenses of duress or bad faith. In <i>Brookside Farms,</i> however, the important question is whether a contract modification must be in writing to be enforceable. Section 2-209(3) of the Code provides that the “requirements of the statute of frauds section of this Article must be satisfied if the contract as modified is within its provisions.” Many courts have held not only that a writing is required when the modification brings an oral contract within the statute but also that all modifications must be in writing whenever the contract was within the scope of §2-201 originally and remains within the statute after the change. See Zemco Mfg., Inc. v. Navistar Int’l Transp. Corp., 186 F.3d 815, 819 (7th Cir. 1999) (stating that this is the majority view). However, the opposing view focuses on the point that UCC §2-201(1) requires a memorandum to specify only the quantity; <span title="797" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-797">p. 797</span>other terms, such as the price, may be expressed orally. Under this analysis, an oral modification of a written agreement would be enforceable unless the modification would either change the quantity term or increase the price above the $500 UCC threshold. This approach harmonizes the modification section, §2-209, with the basic statute of frauds section, §2-201(1); respects the plain statutory language of §2-209(3); and is consistent with common commercial practice of oral modifications. See Costco v. World Wide, 898 P.2d 347, 351 (Wash. Ct. App. 1995). Commentators support this approach. See Zemco Mfg., Inc. v. Navistar Int’l Transp. Corp., 186 F.3d at 820 n.6. The court in <i>Brookside Farms</i> finds a middle ground approach to the question of when modifications must be in writing under §2-209(3). What justifies the court’s conclusion? Which approach to defining when modifications are required to be in writing is most persuasive?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03903554-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>No-oral-modification clause.</i>  In <i>Brookside Farms,</i> the defendant buyer also relied on a provision of the agreement that any modification must be in writing and signed to be effective — a “no-oral-modification,” or “NOM” clause. At common law, such clauses were usually held to be ineffective because parties retained the freedom to later modify their agreement by whatever mode they might choose, written or oral. See Barinaga v. JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co., 749 F. Supp. 2d 1164 (D. Or. 2010) (under Oregon law “no oral modification” clause would not bar evidence of oral promise by bank to alter mortgage payments to avoid foreclosure, but claim failed for lack of consideration and definite terms); Truhe v. Turnac Group, L.L.C., 599 N.W.2d 378 (S.D. 1999) (surveying states and agreeing with majority that “no oral modification” clauses are generally not enforceable under the common law, but noting that California, New York, and Texas have narrowed rule by statutory provision). In §2-209(2), however, the Code authorizes parties to employ a NOM clause to create a “private statute of frauds” governing modifications by providing that a “signed agreement which excludes modification or rescission except by a signed writing cannot be otherwise modified or rescinded. . . .” (Comment 3 indicates that both §§2-209(2) and (3) are “intended to protect against false allegations of oral modifications.”) Thus, §2-209(2) departs from the common law by generally making NOM clauses enforceable.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03903555-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Reliance and oral modifications.</i> Both §§2-209(2) and (3) must be read in conjunction with §2-209(4), which provides that “[a]lthough an attempt at modification or rescission does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (2) or (3) it can operate as a waiver.” In a leading case in this area, Wisconsin Knife Works v. National Metal Crafters, 781 F.2d 1280 (7th Cir. 1986), the parties entered into a written contract containing a “no oral modification” clause. The seller failed to deliver the goods by the dates required in the contract, and the buyer sued for breach. The seller claimed that the parties had orally agreed to modify the delivery schedule. Writing for the majority and remanding for a new trial, Judge Posner ruled that the seller could establish “waiver” of the clause requiring modifications to be in writing if it could show that it detrimentally relied on the buyer’s indications that late delivery would be accepted. Dissenting Judge Easterbrook argued that the term “waiver” should <span title="798" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-798">p. 798</span>be interpreted traditionally, as a voluntary relinquishment of a known right, not dependent on a showing of reliance. Nevertheless, Judge Easterbrook would arrive at an outcome similar to the majority because he reasoned that a waiver could be retracted under §2-209(5) except if material reliance on the oral modification had occurred and would make a retraction unjust. Ultimately, the cases do generally support the proposition that the NOM clause may be waived, by oral agreement to that effect, or by some combination of words and conduct that in the circumstances evidences the parties’ willingness to dispense with its protection, and that reliance will prevent retraction of the waiver. See, e.g., Dynamic Machine Works, Inc. v. Machine &amp; Electrical Consultants, Inc., 831 N.E.2d 875 (Mass. 2005).</p>
<p id="03903556-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to the NOM clause, the contract between Brookside and MRI also contained a “no-waiver” clause, intended to insulate the parties (or at least the drafter) from a claim that any provision in the contract, including the NOM clause, had been orally waived. The <i>Brookside Farms</i> court rather ingeniously finds the no-waiver clause to be overcome in the same manner that the statute of frauds may be overcome, by actual performance. It may be useful at this point to see the NOM clause (perhaps in conjunction with its sidekick, the no-waiver clause) as playing in this area the same sort of role that a strong merger clause may play with respect to the parol evidence rule. Hearkening back to formalistic notions of contract law, the combined effect of the merger clause and the NOM clause is to ensure that in the future any dispute between the parties will be resolved on the basis of the writing, and <i>only</i> the writing. Arrayed on the other side — in favor of the court’s enforcing or at least considering the parties’ informal, oral agreements, as evidenced by both words and conduct — are a variety of doctrines characteristic of “modern” contract law: rules proscribing fraud and nondisclosure, the implied obligations of good faith and fair dealing, the concept of estoppel, and perhaps even unconscionability. For a discussion of the reliance issues raised — on both sides — by the parol evidence rule and the NOM clause, see Charles L. Knapp, Rescuing Reliance: The Perils of Promissory Estoppel, 49 Hastings L.J. 1191, 1303-1330 (1998).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03905c67-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Modification through settlement.</i> A problem with both practical and legal aspects that often arises in the context of settlement negotiations is the “full payment” check question. Suppose that a debtor resists payment of an asserted obligation, claiming that he does not owe as much as the creditor claims. What if at some point the debtor offers the creditor a check for some amount less than she claims, and says, in effect, “Here’s a check for what I’m willing to pay, marked ‘payment in full.’ You can have this now, without a lawsuit, but only if you accept it as a full settlement of your claim.” If the creditor accepts and cashes the check, can she later assert a right to payment of the balance of her claim? Pre-Code law was clear on the point: so long as the amount actually owed is either “unliquidated” (generally, not reduced to a dollar amount) or the subject of a good faith dispute, acceptance of a check tendered in full payment will in legal effect amount to an “accord and satisfaction” that discharges any remaining obligation. Agreements to settle a <i>liquidated, undisputed</i> claim for <span title="799" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-799">p. 799</span>less than the full amount have traditionally not been binding on the creditor, under the rule of the old English case of Foakes v. Beer, L.R. 9 A.C. 605 (H.L. 1884), an extension of the “pre-existing duty” rule, which is itself a corollary of the general doctrine of consideration. The rule of Foakes v. Beer has been the subject of much critical comment, and modern developments have tended to reduce its importance. E.g., UCC §1-306 (claim arising out of breach can be discharged in whole or part without consideration by agreement in authenticated record). See generally E. Allan Farnsworth, Contracts §§4.21-4.25 (4th ed. 2004), for a full discussion of the consideration issues that can arise in connection with settlement and discharge agreements.</p>
<p id="03905c68-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose the creditor does not simply cash the debtor’s “full payment” check, but instead attempts to do so while at the same time reserving its rights to seek the balance due from the debtor. The creditor might send the debtor a letter to that effect, or might endorse the check “under protest” or “with full reservation of rights.” What effect will such steps have? Under the traditional common law rule such an attempted reservation would have no effect; the cashing of the check would still amount to acceptance by the creditor of the debtor’s offer of an accord and satisfaction. (See Restatement (Second) §281 on accord and satisfaction as performance of agreement to accept substituted performance in lieu of original duty.) It once appeared that the Code might have changed this result in what is now UCC §1-308(a) [formerly §1-207(1)], which provides for performance of contract under reservation of rights. The subsequent addition of §1-308(b) [formerly §1-207(2)] clarified that cashing a full payment check, even with reservation of rights, still constitutes an accord and satisfaction, barring the creditor from collecting the unpaid balance, unless the creditor can establish a ground for avoiding the accord and satisfaction, such as duress.</p></li>

Unfortunately, two weeks before the tour, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service notified the drummer for the group that he would not be able to enter the country under the P-1 visa. The drummer was not told the reason, but he suspects that it is because of a recent criminal conviction for drug use. R2D2 is prepared to hire a substitute drummer, but National Artists is afraid that the tour will suffer because of the drummer’s absence. However, even before the problem with the drummer arose, tickets sales for the group’s tour have been surprisingly slow. Is National Artists entitled to cancel the contract because of the unavailability of R2D2’s usual drummer?</p>

If the parties were aware, prior to the execution of a contract, that they were in error concerning a particular fact, there would be no misapprehension in signing the contract.

Galtaco says this suggests Kelsey-Hayes also could have obtained another source of supply, and thus it was not under economic duress when it assented to the latter 1989 agreement. But this merely presents an issue to be resolved by the trier of fact. Moreover, when seeking alternate supplies of castings, Kelsey-Hayes may have faced more difficulty than Galtaco’s other customers. Kelsey-Hayes had to source 30 different safety related castings representing perhaps 45%-50% of the total output of the Galtaco foundries.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="038f4aa7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10B9B_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" id="note-N10B9B_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">7</a></span>&nbsp;Given the changing nature of the automobile industry, Galtaco’s actions are more likely to constitute duress. It is well known that in an effort to promote efficiency, car manufacturers are reducing the size of their reserve banks of parts. As a result, component parts are often incorporated into a finished product within a few hours of their delivery. A supplier’s failure to make scheduled shipments may have immediate and dramatic consequences. Aware of this, companies in the position of Kelsey-Hayes will face more pressure to agree to the extortionate demands of suppliers who breach their contractual obligations. Thus, a breach of contract in the automotive industry may be more coercive than in other industries.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="038f4aa8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10BA7_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" id="note-N10BA7_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">8</a></span>&nbsp;The facts here also mirror an example of economic duress cited in Restatement (Second) of Contracts, §175 comment b, illustration 5 (1982):</p>

Cook, testified as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="038f4aac-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56">We had conveyed to all of our customers that we needed a written acceptance of the 30 percent price increase or we would not make shipments on May 15th, which was a Monday. The Monday shipments were prepared on Friday night and were shipped out Sunday night. Our shipping supervisors had instructions that those shipments were not to be made unless they had been given approval by me or through someone designated by me that we had, in fact, received those written approvals. Late on Friday we still had not received those from anyone in Kelsey-Hayes. And Ron Olweean called me to find out what he had and how to do it.</p>

Section 178, comment F reads:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="038fe715-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56">Though there has been no satisfaction of the Statute, an estoppel may preclude objection on that ground in the same way that objection to the nonexistence of other facts essential for the establishment of a right or a defence may be precluded. A misrepresentation that there has been such satisfaction if substantial action is taken in reliance on the representation, precludes proof by the party who made the representation that it was false.</p>
</div><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="038fe71d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10D1E_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" id="note-N10D1E_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">3</a></span>&nbsp;Mr. Burt’s affidavit states that MRI promised to make the price change notations in regards to the first $1.50 per pound price increase. The Court notes that Burt does not specifically state that the parties agreed to alter the contract with each subsequent price change. Nevertheless, given the sophistication of the parties involved in this case and their extended course of conduct with one another, it is entirely reasonable to expect that, once having promised to make such changes, and having acted on these changes by shipment and subsequent payment, Plaintiff could have relied on MRI’s initial promise to make a written notation to allow their commercial dealings to go forward.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="03900e2f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10D29_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" id="note-N10D29_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">4</a></span>&nbsp;The Court realizes, of course, that the duty of good faith and fair dealing under §1.203 does not state an independent cause of action. Rather, it is designed to make an agreement’s promises effective and defines other duties which grow out of specific contractual obligations. See id. at 482.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="0390354b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10D66_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" id="note-N10D66_2c3aa388-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">5</a></span>&nbsp;Because of the general paucity of relevant Texas authority presented in the instant Motions, the Court does not rule on the question of whether sufficient written materials are present in this case to bring the oral agreements out of the Statute of Frauds. The Court notes, however, that purchase orders and invoices were generated for every shipment of basil made and that other courts have found such materials sufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds. See Brochsteins, Inc. v. Whittaker Corp., 791 F. Supp. 660, 661 (S.D. Tex. 1992).</p></div>

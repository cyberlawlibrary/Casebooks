<p id="03ae4482-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have seen that modern contract law recognizes three interests as the basis for awarding damages: expectation, reliance, and restitution. (Recall the excerpt from the Fuller and Perdue article quoted in the introduction to Chapter 10.) When and how should damages be determined based on the reliance interest rather than the expectation interest? The following materials explore these questions.</p>

<p id="03ae448d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hightower Productions Ltd. (appellees and cross-appellants) came into being in 1974 as a promotional venture conceived by Ira Adler, Frank Billitz and J. Daniel Quinn. The principals intended to employ a singer-entertainer who would live in a specially constructed mobile flagpole perch from April 1, 1975, until New Years Eve at which time he would descend in Times Square in New York before a nationwide television audience having established a new world record for flagpole sitting.</p>
<p id="03ae6b9e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The young man selected to perform this feat was to be known as “Woody Hightower.” The venture was to be publicized by radio and television exposure, by adopting a theme song and by having the uncrowned champion make appearances from his perch throughout the country at concerts, state fairs and shopping centers.</p>
<p id="03ae6b9f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In November, 1974, the three principals approached Michael Kaminkow of the law firm of Wartzman, Rombro, Rudd and Omansky, P.A., for the specific purpose of incorporating their venture. Mr. Kaminkow, a trial attorney, referred them to his partner, Paul Wartzman.</p>
<p id="03ae6ba0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The three principals met with Mr. Wartzman at his home and reviewed the promotional scheme with him. They indicated that they needed to sell stock to the public in order to raise the $250,000 necessary to finance the project. Shortly thereafter, the law firm prepared and filed the articles of incorporation and Hightower Productions Ltd. came into existence on November 6, 1974. The Articles of Incorporation authorized the issuance of one million shares of stock of the par value of 10 cents per share, or a total of $100,000.00.</p>
<p id="03ae6ba1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1003" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1003">p. 1003</span>Following incorporation, the three principals began developing the project. With an initial investment of $20,000, they opened a corporate account at Maryland National Bank and an office in the Pikesville Plaza Building. Then began the search for “Woody Hightower.” After numerous interviews, twenty-three year old John Jordan emerged as “Woody Hightower.”</p>
<p id="03ae6ba2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After selecting the flagpole tenant, the corporation then sought and obtained a company to construct the premises to house him. This consisted of a seven foot wide perch that was to include a bed, toilet, water, refrigerator and heat. The accommodations were atop an hydraulic lift system mounted upon a flat bed tractor trailer.</p>
<p id="03ae6ba3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hightower employed two public relations specialists to coordinate press and public relations efforts and to obtain major corporate backers. “Woody” received a proclamation from the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore and after a press breakfast at the Hilton Hotel on “All Fools Day” ascended his home in the sky.</p>
<p id="03ae6ba4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Within ten days, Hightower obtained a live appearance for “Woody” on the Mike Douglas Show, and a commitment for an appearance on the Wonderama television program. The principals anticipated a “snowballing” effect from commercial enterprises as the project progressed with no substantial monetary commitments for approximately six months.</p>
<p id="03ae6ba5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hightower raised $43,000.00 by selling stock in the corporation. Within two weeks of “Woody’s” ascension, another stockholders’ meeting was scheduled, because the corporation was low on funds. At that time, Mr. Wartzman informed the principals that no further stock could be sold, because the corporation was “structured wrong,” and it would be necessary to obtain the services of a securities attorney to correct the problem. Mr. Wartzman had acquired this information in a casual conversation with a friend who recommended that the corporation should consult with a securities specialist.</p>
<p id="03ae6ba6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The problem was that the law firm had failed to prepare an offering memorandum and failed to assure that the corporation had made the required disclosures to prospective investors in accordance with the provisions of the Maryland Securities Act Article 32A. (The Act was repealed and re-enacted in 1975 as CA Sec. 11-101 to 11-805). Mr. Wartzman advised Hightower that the cost of the specialist would be between $10,000.00 and $15,000.00. Hightower asked the firm to pay for the required services and the request was rejected.</p>
<p id="03ae6ba7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hightower then employed substitute counsel and scheduled a shareholders’ meeting on April 28, 1975. At that meeting, the stockholders were advised that Hightower was not in compliance with the securities laws; that $43,000.00, the amount investors had paid for issued stock, had to be covered by the promoters and placed in escrow; that the fee of a securities specialist would be $10,000.00 to $15,000.00 and that the additional work would require between six and eight weeks. In the interim, additional stock could not be sold, nor could “Woody” be exhibited across state lines. Faced with these problems, the shareholders decided to discontinue the entire project.</p>
<p id="03ae6ba8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On October 8, 1975, Hightower filed suit alleging breach of contract and negligence for the law firm’s failure to have created a corporation authorized <span title="1004" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1004">p. 1004</span>to raise the capital necessary to fund the venture. At the trial, Hightower introduced into evidence its obligations and expenditures incurred in reliance on the defendant law firm’s creation of a corporation authorized to raise the $250,000.00, necessary to fund the project. The development costs incurred included corporate obligations amounting to $155,339 including: initial investments by Adler and Billitz, $20,000; shareholders, excluding the three promoters, $43,010; outstanding liabilities exclusive of salaries, $58,929; liability to talent consultants, $25,000; and accrued salaries to employees, $8,400.</p>
<p id="03ae6ba9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Individual liabilities to the three promoters, Adler, Billitz and Quinn, totaled $88,608, including loans to the corporation $44,692; repayment of corporate debt to Maryland National Bank, $8,016; and loss of salaries $36,000. The trial court disposed of the individual suit filed by the promoters, Adler, Billitz and Quinn and the cross complaint filed by the appellants. The only claim submitted for the jury’s consideration was the claim of the corporation, Hightower, against the defendant law firm.</p>
<p id="03ae6baa-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The jury returned a verdict in favor of Hightower in the amount of $170,508.43. Wartzman, Rombro, Rudd and Omansky, P.A., appealed to this Court. Hightower filed a cross appeal alleging that the jury should have been permitted to consider prejudgment interest.</p>
<p id="03ae6bab-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The appellants raise four issues for our consideration:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-decimal">
<li class=""><p id="03ae6bac-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court erred in permitting Hightower to recover “reliance damages” or “development costs.”</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03ae6bad-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If “reliance damages” were recoverable, the trial court failed to properly instruct the jury on the law concerning their recovery.</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="03ae92bf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court erroneously permitted a member of the plaintiff’s law firm to testify as a witness in the case.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p id="03ae92c0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>RELIANCE DAMAGES</b></p>
<p id="03ae92c1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The appellants first contend that the jury verdict included all of Hightower’s expenditures and obligations incurred during its existence resulting in the law firm being absolute surety for all costs incurred in a highly speculative venture. While they do not suggest the analogy, the appellants would no doubt equate the verdict as tantamount to holding the blacksmith liable for the value of the kingdom where the smith left out a nail in shoeing the king’s horse, because of which the shoe was lost, the horse was lost, the king was lost and the kingdom was lost. Appellants contend that there is a lack of nexus or causation between the alleged failure of Mr. Wartzman to discharge his duties as an attorney and the loss claimed by Hightower. Stated differently, an unjust result will obtain where a person performing a collateral service for a new venture will, upon failure to fully perform the service, be liable as full guarantor for all costs incurred by the enterprise.</p>
<p id="03ae92c2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ordinarily, profits lost due to a breach of contract are recoverable. Where anticipated profits are too speculative to be determined, monies <span title="1005" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1005">p. 1005</span>spent in part performance, in preparation for or in reliance on the contract are recoverable. 5 Corbin, Contracts, Sec. 1031, Restatement of Contracts, Sec. 333, cited with approval in Dialist Co. v. Pulford, 42 Md. App. 173, 399 A.2d 1374 (1979).</p>
<p id="03ae92c3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Dialist,</i> supra, a distributor, Pulford, brought suit for breach of an exclusive contract that he had with Dialist. Pulford paid $2500.00 for the distributorship, terminated his employment with another company and expended funds in order to begin developing the area where the product was to be sold. When Pulford learned that another distributor was also given part of his territory he terminated his services.</p>
<p id="03ae92c4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court upheld the award of development costs to Pulford which included out of pocket expenses, telephone installation, office furniture, two months of forfeited salary and the value of medical insurance lost. The Court determined that the expenditures were not in preparation for or part performance of a contract, but in reliance upon it. “Such expenditures are not brought about by reason of the breach. They are induced by reliance on the contract itself and rendered worthless by its breach.” Id. at 181, 399 A.2d 1374.</p>
<p id="03ae92c5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recovery based upon reliance interest is not without limitation. If it can be shown that full performance would have resulted in a net loss, the plaintiff cannot escape the consequences of a bad bargain by falling back on his reliance interest. Where the breach has prevented an anticipated gain and made proof of loss difficult to ascertain, the injured party has a right to damages based upon his reliance interest, including expenditures made in preparation for performance, or in performance, less any loss that the party in breach can prove with reasonable certainty the injured party would have suffered had the contract been performed. Restatement, Second, Contracts, Sec. 349, Holt v. United Security Life Ins. &amp; Trust Co., 76 N.J. 585, 72 A. 301 (1909); In Re Yeager Company, 227 Fed. Supp. 92 (N.D. Ohio, E.D. 1963).</p>
<p id="03ae92c6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The appellants’ contention that permitting the jury to consider that reliance damages in this case rendered the appellants insurers of the venture is without merit. Section 349 of the Restatement, cited above, expressly authorizes the breaching party to prove any loss that the injured party would have suffered had the contract been performed. Such proof would avoid making the breaching party a guarantor of the success of the venture.</p>
<p id="03ae92c7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As Judge Learned Hand stated in Albert &amp; Son v. Armstrong Rubber Company, 178 F.2d 182 (2d Cir. 1949),</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03ae92c8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is often very hard to learn what the value of the performance would have been; and it is a common expedient, and a just one, in such situations to put the peril of the answer upon that party who by his wrong has made the issue relevant to the rights of the other. On principle therefore the proper solution would seem to be that the promisee may recover his outlay in preparation for the performance, subject to the privilege of the promisor to reduce it by as much as he can show that the promisee would have lost if the contract had been performed.</p>
</div>
<p id="03ae92c9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the present case the appellants knew, or should have known, that the success of the venture rested upon the ability of Hightower to sell stock <span title="1006" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1006">p. 1006</span>and secure advertising as public interest in the adventure accelerated. Appellants’ contention that their failure to properly incorporate Hightower was collateral and lacked the necessary nexus to permit consideration of reliance damages is not persuasive. The very life blood of the project depended on the corporation’s ability to sell stock to fund the promotion. This is the reason for the employment of the appellants. In reliance thereon, Hightower sold stock and incurred substantial obligations. When it could no longer sell its stock, the entire project failed. No greater nexus need be established. Aside from questioning the expertise of the promoters based upon their previous employment, the appellants were unable to establish that the stunt was doomed to fail. The inability to establish that financial chaos was inevitable does not make the appellants insurers and does not preclude Hightower from recovering reliance damages. The issue was properly submitted to the jury.</p>
<p id="03ae92ca-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants contend that the appellees should be limited to the recovery of damages under traditional contract and negligence concepts, citing Meyerberg, Sawyer and Rue v. Agee, 51 Md. App. 711, 446 A.2d 69 (1982).</p>
<p id="03ae92cb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Meyerberg,</i> supra, involved a breach of contract action for certification of a title that was not marketable. The trial judge permitted the jury, in assessing damages, to consider:</p>

</ol>
</div>
<p id="03ae92d0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In affirming the decision of the trial court, this Court acknowledged that a contracting party is expected to take account of only those risks that are foreseeable at the time he makes the contract and is not liable in the event of breach for loss that he did not at the time of contracting have reason to foresee as a probable result of such a breach. This limitation is set forth in Restatement, Contracts, (2d), Sec. 351.</p>
<p id="03ae92d1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Meyerberg,</i> we noted that exceptional perception is not relevant to the test of foreseeability when applied to an attorney who is relied upon by a layman to protect his investment from pitfalls which are not readily apparent to those in foreign fields of endeavor.</p>
<p id="03ae92d2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Relying on Cochrane v. Little, 71 Md. 323, 18 A. 698 (1889), we further stated:</p>

<p id="03aeb9e6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants’ primary exception to the court’s damage instruction relates to the failure to include suggested instruction 23b which states:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03aeb9e7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You are instructed that you may not award any damages for unpaid expense of Hightower unless you find that these expenses were incurred by Hightower in justifiable reliance on the defendant’s causing Hightower to comply with the securities laws. If you find that the expenses were not incurred in reliance on the defendant’s performance, or if such reliance was not justified, then you may not award unpaid expenses as damages.</p>
</div>
<p id="03aeb9e8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court instructed the jury that in order to find liability that the plaintiff must prove three things:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03aeb9e9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, the employment of the defendants in behalf of the Plaintiff and the extent of the duties for which the Defendants were employed; secondly, that the Defendants neglected the duties undertaken in the employment and, thirdly, that such negligence resulted in and was the proximate cause of loss by the Plaintiff, that is that the Plaintiff was deprived of any right or parted with anything of value in reliance upon the negligence of the Defendants.</p>
</div>
<p id="03aeb9ea-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The instruction given fairly apprised the jury of the Plaintiffs’ burden and adequately covered the reliance damage concept. Additionally, the court instructed the jury that they could not consider unpaid salaries due its officers or employees or amounts invested by stockholders as recoverable damages.</p>
<p id="03aeb9eb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants further object to the court’s refusal to grant its suggested instructions 23C and D designed to forbid recovery if the jury found that Hightower would not have been able to secure funds to remain in business regardless of the defendants’ breach. The instruction was properly refused. The very nature of reliance damages is that future gain cannot be measured with any reasonable degree of reliability. Had Hightower been able to show lost profits the theory of their right to recover may not have been development costs in reliance on the contract but loss based upon expectation interest instead. Appellants had the opportunity to minimize the recovery by showing that the venture could not succeed. This was difficult, but their failure to do so does not entitle them to an instruction that requires the jury to speculate on the ultimate success of the venture. We find no error in the instructions given by Judge Karwacki.</p>

The instruction offered by appellants is a correct statement of the law. Correctness alone, however, is insufficient to require the court to grant the prayer; there must be evidence to support the proposition to which it relates. Dorough v.

Mr. Wartzman’s offer to set up an appointment for Hightower with an expert in security transactions at Hightower’s expense can hardly be construed as a mitigating device that Hightower was obligated to accept. The party who is in default may not mitigate his damages by showing that the other party could have reduced those damages by expending large amounts of money or incurring substantial obligations. <i>Meyerberg,</i> supra. Since such risks arose because of the breach, they are to be borne by the defaulting party. 22 Am. Jur. 2d, Damages, Sec. 37, Griffin v. Bredouw (Okla.), 420 P.2d 546 (1966).</p>

Appellants had the same opportunity to employ and pay a securities specialist as they contend Hightower should have done. They refused.

<p id="03aeb9f2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hightower, in its cross-appeal, alleges that the issue of pre-judgment interest should have been presented to the jury for its consideration. Applicable Maryland law provides that where a claim is for unliquidated damages, interest may run from the date of the judgment, but not before. <i>Affiliated Distillers,</i> 213 Md. 509, 132 A.2d 582 (1957), Taylor v.

<p id="03aeb9f3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The reliance damages sought in this case are not subject to pre-judgment valuation. “Reasonable and justified” damages incurred by reason of Mr. Wartzman’s representation of Hightower were not reasonably ascertainable until the jury rendered its verdict.

<li class=""><p id="03aeb9fa-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Reliance damages as a substitute remedy.</i> Even if expectation damages would in theory be recoverable, they may not be proveable with reasonable certainty. In such a case, the plaintiff’s fall-back position will usually be to seek recovery of reliance damages. See, e.g., Hollywood Fantasy Corp. v. Gabor, 151 F.3d 203 (5th Cir. 1998) (promoter of “fantasy vacations” for movie fans allowed to recover out-of-pocket expenses from breaching celebrity despite inability to prove lost profits for new venture); World of Boxing LLC v. King, 634 Fed. Appx. 1 (2nd Cir. 2015) (Russian boxing promoters unable to prove with certainty profits lost as a result of American promoter’s breach of contract, but reliance damages for out-of-pocket expenses recoverable). The Restatement also adopts this rule in §349. In <i>Wartzman</i>, what could the plaintiff’s expectation damages have consisted of? What were the obstacles to establishing a claim for such damages?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03aeb9fb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Contract price as limit on reliance damages.</i> The report of the <i>Wartzman</i> case does not indicate the amount the defendants charged for their legal services, but in light of the indication that a “securities specialist” would have cost no more than $15,000, it seems obvious that the defendants’ bill for legal fees was far less than the $170,000 awarded to the plaintiffs. Should this factor bear on the availability of reliance damages? Under the original Restatement, reliance damages as an alternative to expectation damages were stated to be “not recoverable in excess of the full contract price promised by the defendant.” Restatement §333(a). Fuller and Perdue criticized this limitation. They argued that a distinction should be drawn between the costs of performance of the contract (which they labeled “essential reliance”) and the costs incurred in collateral transactions related to the contract (“incidental reliance”). The contract price should limit the recovery only of essential reliance damages. To the extent that essential reliance exceeds the contract price, the contract would be a losing one. An award of essential reliance damages in excess of the contract price would put the injured party in a better position than if the contract had been fully performed. The contract price should not, however, limit the recovery of incidental reliance damages. Lon L. Fuller &amp; William R. Perdue, Jr., The Reliance Interest in Contract Damages, 46 Yale L.J. 52, 77-78 (Pt. I) (1936). For example, in Maine Rubber International v. Environmental Management Group, Inc., 324 F. Supp. 2d 32 (D. Me. 2004), the plaintiff paid the defendant $1,900 to perform an environmental assessment of a prospective business site. After the defendant falsely reported that the property was free of problems, the federal and state governments found environmental hazards and the plaintiff lost more than $211,000 in wasted expenditures when a move to the site was aborted. The court held that these amounts could be recovered as reasonably foreseeable reliance damages even though their total greatly exceeded the contract price.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03aeb9fc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Other limitations on recovery of reliance damages.</i> The Restatement indicates that the doctrines that normally apply to limit recovery of expectation <span title="1010" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1010">p. 1010</span>damages — foreseeability, causation, certainty, and mitigation — should also apply to recovery of reliance damages. E.g., Restatement (Second) §352, Comment <i>a</i> (requirement of certainty). See also L. Albert &amp; Son v. Armstrong Rubber Co., 178 F.2d 182 (2d Cir. 1949) (in contract for sale of rubber reconditioning machines, buyer denied damages for investment in rubber reclaiming department and for cost of scrap rubber because of showing that delay in delivery by seller was only one of several possible causes of loss); Cities Services Co. v. Gulf Oil Corp., 980 P.2d 116 (Okla. 1999) (reliance damages have goal of undoing harm that was foreseeable and can be measured with reasonable certainty).</p>
<p id="03aeb9fd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Merry Gentleman, LLC v. George and Leona Productions, Inc., 799 F.3d 827 (7th Cir. 2015), plaintiff film producer sought to recover from actor-director Michael Keaton reliance damages claimed to have resulted from Keaton’s failure to perform certain duties under his director’s contract with respect to the film “Merry Gentleman.” Affirming the district court’s denial of recovery, the appellate court had this to say about the necessity for showing the causal link between the breaches complained of and the reliance losses asserted:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03aeb9fe-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the typical case where reliance damages are sought, the defendant has simply repudiated the contract and walked away from the deal. This causal link will be straightforward in those cases. As the district court explained, in such cases the nonbreaching plaintiff is left “holding the bag after having made its expenditures.” <i>Merry Gentleman,</i> 76 F. Supp. 3d at 763. In those cases, it is appropriate for the injured party to claim as damages all expenditures it made in preparation for performance because the other side failed to perform at all. In such cases, the complete loss of investment will often be the proximate result of the breach.</p>
<p id="03aee10f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But in cases like this one, where the breaching party has substantially performed and the alleged breaches have to do with the quality of the final product, the causal link between reliance damages and the breach is not so direct. An injured party cannot reasonably claim that <i>all</i> of its expenditures were caused by the other party’s breach without some reason to think the breach destroyed the entire value of the breaching party’s performance. In this context, the breach does not cause the complete loss of investment.</p>
<p id="03aee110-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Take this case, for example. Who can say why a critically praised movie did not make money? Merry Gentleman claims as damages all $5.5 million it spent to produce the movie. If Keaton had somehow prevented completion of the movie, Merry Gentleman might well have been entitled to all expenditures made in preparation for his performance (subject, of course, to the “losing contract” limitation in [Restatement (Second) of Contracts] §349). But here, Keaton actually made the movie. Merry Gentleman complains that Keaton slowed down the production process and failed to publicize the movie adequately after it was finished. No doubt, these services have economic value and, on a proper showing, Merry Gentleman might have been entitled to recover damages for these shortcomings. (Imagine, for instance, if Keaton’s tardiness in submitting the first cut forced Merry Gentleman to pay the film editors for a longer period. Or, to take a more extreme example, imagine if Keaton had publicly criticized the film released to theaters so harshly that no one bought tickets to see it.) But no reasonable trier of fact <span title="1011" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1011">p. 1011</span>could find that Merry Gentleman lost its entire investment of $5.5 million because Keaton failed to submit his first cut on time or failed to publicize the movie better. Merry Gentleman entered the directing contract to have Keaton deliver a finished movie, and he delivered one that showed well at Sundance and won some critical praise. The breaches by Keaton that Merry Gentleman alleges cannot reasonably be said to have rendered the investment completely worthless.</p>

<p id="03aee112-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As we have seen, one of the principal damage-limiting factors is the possibility that the plaintiff could have mitigated the injury resulting from the defendant’s breach. In <i>Wartzman</i>, the court held that the plaintiffs had no obligation to mitigate their damages by paying the amount necessary to hire an attorney specialized in securities law, because the defendants had the same opportunity as the plaintiffs to take that action. This “equal opportunity” exception to the requirement of mitigation has been applied by other courts, although some have expressed doubt about its utility. Compare Chicago Title Insurance Co. v. Huntington National Bank, 719 N.E.2d 955 (Ohio 1999) (failure to mitigate will not limit damages when defendant title company had equal opportunity to that of plaintiff bank to bid on foreclosed home to prevent sale below market value after title company breached contract), with Cates v. Morgan Portable Building Corp., 780 F.2d 683 (7th Cir. 1985) (plaintiff’s obligation to mitigate not offset by fact that defendant had “equal opportunity” to complete performance of installing buildings for plaintiff’s motel facility; defendant could mitigate only by performing as promised while plaintiff had variety of other options, and application of “questionable” equal opportunity rule would remove incentive for plaintiff to act reasonably in mitigation). Did the <i>Wartzman</i> court properly reject the defendant’s mitigation argument?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03aee113-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Losing contracts.</i> In the course of its opinion in <i>Wartzman</i>, the court notes another potential limitation on the recovery of reliance expenses, quoting from Restatement (Second) §349: recovery should be offset by “any loss that the party in breach can prove with reasonable certainty the injured party would have suffered had the contract been performed.” The defendant, however, would have the burden of showing that the contract would have been a losing one for the plaintiff. Accord Agam v. Gavra, 186 Cal. Rptr. 3d 295 (Ct. App. 2015) (California adopts the “losing contract” limitation on the award of reliance damages). In a case like <i>Wartzman</i>, where expectation damages in the form of lost profits were impossible to show with reasonable certainty, shifting the burden to the defendant may at least permit the plaintiff to recover its reliance costs, because of the difficulty of showing that the plaintiff’s venture would have been a losing one. That burden is not always an impossible one to carry, however. See, e.g., Home Depot USA, Inc. v. Cytec Indus., Inc., 2013 WL 388202 (Conn. Super. Ct.) (with aid of expert testimony, defendant proved that even if it had not breached contract to convey real property to plaintiff, projected real estate development could not have been completed and generated sufficient revenue to recoup plaintiff’s reliance costs); St. Lawrence Factory Stores v. Ogdensburg Bridge and Port Auth., 994 N.Y.S.2d 704 (App. <span title="1012" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1012">p. 1012</span>Div. 2014) (following earlier proceedings in which appellate court ruled that plaintiff should be permitted to go to trial on its claim for reliance damages, trial court’s denial of recovery upheld; defendant has only to show with “reasonable certainty” that plaintiff could not have recouped expenditures even if defendant had not breached).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03aee114-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Precontract reliance.</i> Courts may not allow a party to recover for reliance costs incurred before the contract was made. See Chicago Coliseum Club v. Dempsey, 265 Ill. App. 542 (1932) (fight promoter not allowed to recover expenses incurred before defendant signed contract to perform); Drysdale v. Woerth, 153 F. Supp. 2d 678 (E.D. Pa. 2001) (tenant may not recover reliance damages for improvements made to property while tenant occupied property under one-year lease prior to negotiation of 20-year lease renewal, but tenant may recover in restitution for increase in market value of defendant’s property as result of improvements); E. Allan Farnsworth, Contracts §12.16, at 805. But see Security Stove &amp; Manufacturing Co. v. American Railway Express Co., 51 S.W.2d 572 (Mo. Ct. App. 1932) (shipper allowed to recover precontract expenses from carrier who failed to deliver goods to exhibition, thus causing expenses to be wasted); Gregory S. Crespi, Recovering Pre-Contractual Expenditures as an Element of Reliance Damages, 49 S.M.U. L. Rev. (1995) (generally supporting recovery of pre-contract expenditures when parties would reasonably contemplate that the expenses would be wasted in the event of breach and other limits on recovery do not apply).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03aee115-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Forgone opportunities as reliance damages.</i> Ordinarily, reliance damages are thought of as out-of-pocket expenditures made by the plaintiff. Sometimes, however, protection of the injury to the plaintiff’s reliance extends further, taking into account the gains the plaintiff would have made had she not relied on the promises of the defendant. See Dialist Co. v. Pulford, 399 A.2d 1374, 1382 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1979) (after breach of exclusive territory provision, plaintiff permitted to recover not only initial franchise fee but also amount of lost salary after quitting his original job until reemployed; court asserted that “giving up one’s livelihood in reliance on, in preparation for and in performance of, a contractual obligation can be as real a detriment as out-of-pocket expenditures”); Bouton v. Byers, 321 P.3d 780 (Kan. Ct. App. 2015) (plaintiff daughter entitled to recover in action for promissory estoppel reliance damages based on the amount of salary she would have earned from teaching, employment she forwent in reliance on father’s promise to leave ranch property to her if she would come and help him work the ranch).</p></li>

<p id="03af082e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1987, Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., conducted market surveys throughout the United States to identify the best markets for the new line of “Lexus” automobiles that Toyota planned to introduce in 1989. The market studies identified the Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota, metropolitan area as a two-dealership market and recommended establishing dealerships in two suburban areas — Wayzata and the Bloomington/Richfield area.</p>
<p id="03af082f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In April 1988, Toyota issued letters of intent for the prospective dealerships in the two locations. The recipient of the letter for the Bloomington/Richfield dealership was unwilling or unable to comply with the conditions of the letter of intent and returned it to Toyota in early 1989. Soon after, Toyota began to search anew for a dealer for the Bloomington/Richfield location. Lexus Central Region Area Manager, James Melton, asked Stephen Haag, the Central Region Market Manager, to contact Walser, who was then co-owner with McLaughlin of a BMW dealership and a Lincoln-Mercury dealership both located in Bloomington. Both Walser and McLaughlin met with Haag and indicated that they would be interested in obtaining the Lexus dealership.</p>
<p id="03af0830-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Toyota had instituted a three-step process to establish dealerships. First, the prospective dealer would fill out a formal application and propose a dealership plan to Toyota. If acceptable, then Toyota would issue a letter of intent signed by the head of the Lexus division and to be signed by the prospective dealer, which would contain final conditions that had to be satisfied before the agreement was finalized. If all conditions were satisfied, then a formal dealership agreement would be approved by Toyota and signed by the parties to establish the dealership.</p>
<p id="03af0831-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[After Walser and McLaughlin formally applied for the Lexus dealership, Haag told Walser in October 1989 that the letter of intent would soon be approved. Subsequently, in December 1989, Haag told Walser that “you’re our dealer” and that the letter of intent had been formally approved by Lexus management. A few days later Haag called Walser to tell him that a mistake had been made, that the letter had not been finally approved, and that additional financial information would be necessary. In the meantime Walser’s father, R.J. Walser, had agreed to purchase property for the proposed Lexus dealership. In February 1990, Haag informed Walser that Lexus would not be issuing the letter of intent to him and McLaughlin. — <span class="epub-small-caps">Eds</span>.]</p>

Walser and McLaughlin sought relief under the following theories: breach of the Minnesota motor vehicle franchise statute (count I); breach of contract (count II); promissory estoppel (count III); joint venture (count IV); fraud (count V); intentional interference with contractual relations (count VI); and interference with a prospective business advantage (count VII). Toyota removed this action to the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota.</p>
<p id="03af0833-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The district court granted Toyota’s motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed the claims for breach of the Minnesota motor vehicle franchise statute and for recovery on a joint venture theory. Prior to trial, the parties filed a joint stipulation to dismiss without prejudice the claims for intentional interference with contractual relations and interference with a prospective business advantage. The case went to trial in February 1992 on the breach of contract, promissory estoppel, and fraud claims. Walser and McLaughlin sought approximately $7,600,000 in damages, which included expected lost profits. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Toyota on the contract and fraud claims but in favor of Walser and McLaughlin on the promissory estoppel claim. The jury awarded Walser and McLaughlin $232,131 in accordance with the district court’s instruction to limit damages on the promissory estoppel claim to Walser and McLaughlin’s out-of-pocket expenses.</p>

<p id="03af083c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A promise binding under this section is a contract, and full-scale enforcement by normal remedies is often appropriate. But the same factors which bear on whether any relief should be granted also bear on the character and extent of the remedy. <i>In particular, relief may sometimes be limited to restitution or to damages or specific relief measured by the extent of the promisee’s reliance rather than by the terms of the promise.</i></p>

<p id="03af083d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Restatement (Second) of Contracts §90 cmt. <i>d</i> (emphasis added). Minnesota courts have incorporated the underlined language stating: “When a promise is enforced pursuant to section 90 ‘[t]he remedy granted for breach may be limited as justice requires.’ Relief <i>may be limited</i> to damages measured by the promisee’s reliance.” Grouse v. Group Health Plan, 306 N.W.2d 114, 116 (Minn. 1981) (alterations in original) (emphasis added). The Minnesota Court of Appeals, relying on <i>Grouse,</i> further stated that “relief <i>may be limited</i> to the party’s out-of-pocket expenses made in reliance on the promise.” Dallum v.

<p id="03af083e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The critical question in this case is whether the language of section 90 as interpreted by the Minnesota courts authorized the district court to limit damages to Walser and McLaughlin’s out-of-pocket expenses. We conclude that it did. This language is permissive — courts <i>may</i> limit relief as justice requires. The Minnesota Court of Appeals specifically stated that “relief <i>may</i> be limited to the party’s out-of-pocket expenses made in reliance on the promise.” <i>Dallum,</i> 462 N.W.2d at 613 (emphasis added). This permissive language and the Minnesota courts’ interpretation of it indicate to us that Minnesota courts, like the other courts addressing this issue, treat the damages decision under section 90 as being within the district court’s discretion. See, e.g., Chedd-Angier Prod. Co., Inc. v. Omni Publications Int’l, Ltd., 756 F.2d 930, 937 (1st Cir. 1985) (in determining damages under section 90 “whether to charge full contract damages, or something less, is a matter of discretion delegated to district courts”); Green v. Interstate United Management Serv. Corp., 748 F.2d 827, 831 (3d Cir. 1984) (concluding that district court did not abuse its “equitable discretion” under section 90 “in refusing to allow full-scale enforcement of the promise”); Signal Hill Aviation Co. v. Stroppe, 96 Cal. App. 3d 627, 158 Cal. Rptr. 178, 186 (1979) (“California Supreme Court appeared to emphasize . . . the exercise of judicial discretion in promissory estoppel cases to fashion relief to do justice”) (citing C &amp; K Eng’g Contractors v.

TXO Prod. Corp., 738 F.2d 968, 970 (8th Cir. 1984).

<p id="03af2f51-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our review of the record . . . also reveals that the district court did not make a “clear error of judgment” in finding that justice required limiting Walser and McLaughlin to out-of-pocket expenses. Toyota presented evidence that the dealership was far from a certainty and that Walser and McLaughlin would have great difficulty in meeting the capitalization requirements. The negotiations were still in a preliminary stage and broke down at that point. The promise on which they relied did not guarantee that they would get the dealership, as there were other conditions in the letter of intent that still would have had to be satisfied. Walser and McLaughlin could have relied on the promise for only a short period of time, as they were informed by Haag only a couple of days later that he had misinformed them about the status of the letter of intent. Moreover, Walser and McLaughlin have not demonstrated any opportunity they lost by virtue of relying on the promise by Toyota. Accordingly, the district court did not make a clear error of judgment in limiting Walser and McLaughlin’s damages on their promissory estoppel claim to out-of-pocket expenses.</p>

<p id="03af2f54-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Walser and McLaughlin next argue that the district court erred in limiting out-of-pocket expenses to “the difference between the actual value of the property and the price paid for it.” (Jury Instr. No. 34.) They argue that they should have been allowed to “recoup” at least the full amount of the “unamortized capital investments” they made in attempting to obtain the dealership. They claim the full value of their investment totals more than $1,000,000 including the $676,864 they paid for the land and the various expenses in maintaining it.</p>

[W]e find no error in the district court’s instruction to the extent that it defined their out-of-pocket expenses to be only the difference between the actual value and the amount paid for the property. Such an instruction reflects the amount of damage Walser and McLaughlin suffered from relying on Toyota’s promise. For example, while the purchase price of the land totalled $676,864 Walser acknowledged in his trial testimony that the land still had significant value, worth at least $550,000. (Tr. Vol. VI at 23-24.) Their <i>damage</i> from relying on Toyota’s promise is essentially the difference between the two amounts. <span title="1017" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1017">p. 1017</span>Accordingly, the district court committed no error in instructing the jury on how to determine the damage award.</p>

<li class=""><p id="03af2f5c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Measuring damages in promissory estoppel actions.</i> In the first case in this section, we saw that an injured party may recover reliance damages for breach of contract even if she is unable to prove expectation damages with reasonable certainty. Suppose, however, that liability is based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel and the plaintiff has suffered expectation damages (lost profits, for example), which the plaintiff is able to prove with reasonable certainty. Should the plaintiff be entitled to recover these expectation damages, or should the plaintiff’s recovery always be limited to the amount of her actual reliance? Or is the best approach the one adopted by the <i>Walser</i> court, allowing the trial court discretion to award a full range of remedies for promissory estoppel, including expectation or reliance-based recovery, as justice seems to require?</p>
<p id="03af2f5d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In assessing the merits of these various remedial approaches, it may help to recall that the doctrine of promissory estoppel was viewed originally as a substitute for consideration rather than an independent theory of recovery. The logical consequence of this view was that the injured party would be entitled to recover full expectation damages.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03af2f5e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>View that damages should be limited to protection of reliance interest.</i> As the use of promissory estoppel became more widespread, some commentators questioned whether recovery of expectation damages was just. Writing in 1950, Professor Benjamin Boyer stated: “There is no real need for the courts to restrict themselves to giving only complete enforcement. It is to be hoped that the trend will be towards a protection of the reliance interest of the promisee without the injustice to the promisor that is often patent when complete enforcement is granted.” Benjamin F. Boyer, Promissory Estoppel: Requirements and Limitations of the Doctrine, 98 U. Pa. L. Rev. 459, 497 (1950). A number of significant, relatively early promissory estoppel cases did limit recovery to reliance damages. See Goodman v. Dicker, 169 F.2d 684 (D.C. Cir. 1948) (reliance on promise that radio franchise would be awarded; recovery limited to expenses incurred preparing to do business); Wheeler v. White, 398 S.W.2d 93 (Tex. 1965) (reliance on promise to procure or make a loan to develop property; recovery limited to losses incurred in reliance on promise); Hoffman v. Red Owl Stores, Inc., 133 N.W.2d 267 (Wis. 1965) (promissory estoppel adopted and applied to precontract reliance but recovery limited to reliance damages). The court in <i>Wheeler</i> explicitly stated that expectation damages would not be <span title="1018" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1018">p. 1018</span>recoverable even if they could be proven with reasonable certainty and based its holding, in part, on the reasoning that the promisee “in such cases is partially responsible for his failure to bind the promisor to a legally sufficient contract.” 398 S.W.2d at 97. Accord, Bruce Foods Corp. v. Texas Gas Serv., 2014 WL 652312 (W.D. Tex.) (plaintiff may only recover reliance damages on its promissory estoppel claim, citing <i>Wheeler</i>).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03af566f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>View that courts should have discretion in determining measure of damages.</i> As reflected by citations in its opinion, a number of other courts agree with the appellate court in <i>Walser</i> that a trial court has discretion to award expectation, reliance, or some other form of remedy when the basis of recovery is promissory estoppel. See, e.g., Woodland Harvesting, Inc. v. Georgia Pacific Corp., 2011 WL 4596041 (E.D. Mich.) (reliance damages typical remedy for promissory estoppel, but courts occasionally award lost profits); Nightingale v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 2015 WL 6549364 (S.D. Ohio) (plaintiff employee could recover in promissory estoppel for expectancy of lost future wages). See also Restatement (Second) §90, Comment <i>d</i> (“full-scale enforcement by normal remedies is often appropriate”); Dynalectric Co. of Nevada, Inc. v. Clark &amp; Sullivan Constructors, Inc., 255 P.3d 286 (Nev. 2011) (agreeing with Restatement §90 and majority of jurisdictions that remedy for promissory estoppel should be flexible; may be expectation, reliance, or restitution damages as justice requires); Grandoe Corp. v. Gander Mountain Co., 2013 WL 3353927 (D. Minn.) (plaintiff manufacturer left with warehouse full of specially-manufactured, unsaleable gloves entitled to recovery of lost profits; <i>Walser</i> discussed and distinguished), <i>aff’d</i>, 761 F.3d 876, 881 n.3 (8th Cir. 2014) (contract damages awarded; issue of damages for promissory estoppel not reached). See generally Charles L. Knapp, Reliance in the Revised <i>Restatement</i>: The Proliferation of Promissory Estoppel, 81 Colum. L. Rev. 52, 57-58 (1981) (noting lack of clarity in comments and illustrations to §90 regarding when expectancy damages should be available). If the court in <i>Walser</i> had been willing to give expectancy relief, could the plaintiffs’ expectation interest have been measured with reasonable certainty?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03af5670-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Scholarly commentary.</i> As discussion of the proper remedy for promissory estoppel has continued, some writers have argued that expectation damages may often be the appropriate remedy in promissory estoppel cases. These writers claim that an award of expectation damages may be the best way of compensating the injured party for reliance damages that may be difficult to prove. In commercial cases, such reliance could take the form of forgone contractual opportunities, including numerous and difficult to prove acts or forbearances that may be deemed to make up the “total reliance” of the plaintiff. Comment, Once More into the Breach: Promissory Estoppel and Traditional Damages Doctrine, 37 U. Chi. L. Rev. 559, 566-567 (1970).</p>
<p id="03af5671-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a 1987 study of this area, Professor Mary Becker found that expectation-based remedies are commonly and routinely awarded in promissory estoppel cases and concluded that where recovery is limited to reliance damages, this is usually not because promissory estoppel is the basis of recovery, but because an expectation-based recovery would fail to satisfy one of the other requirements, such as certainty or foreseeability. Mary E. Becker, Promissory <span title="1019" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1019">p. 1019</span>Estoppel Damages, 16 Hofstra L. Rev. 131 (1987). By contrast, Professor Robert A. Hillman observed that the cases did not clearly show a judicial preference for reliance or expectancy damages in promissory estoppel actions, but he did conclude that the cases establish “that courts take seriously the admonition of the second Restatement to award damages as justice requires.” Robert A. Hillman, Questioning the “New Consensus” on Promissory Estoppel: An Empirical and Theoretical Study, 98 Colum. L. Rev. 580, 610 (1998). Professor Eric Holmes reached a similar conclusion that courts consider the remedy for promissory estoppel as discretionary and award a “full range of remedies” that includes expectation and reliance damages. Eric Mills Holmes, Restatement of Promissory Estoppel, 32 Willamette L. Rev. 263, 295-296 (1996).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03af5672-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Specific performance in promissory estoppel actions.</i> As we shall see later in this chapter, cases involving land are usually good candidates for specific performance or other types of equitable relief. Such literal enforcement of the defendant’s obligation is in one sense the most purely expectation-based remedy. The Restatement (Second) apparently contemplates the award of specific performance in promissory estoppel cases involving land (see §90, Illustration 11). Recall the Harvey v. Dow case from Chapter 3 in which the court granted specific performance relief to the plaintiff. See also Jackson v. Morse, 871 A.2d 47 (N.H. 2005) (full range of remedies are available for promissory estoppel, including specific performance in appropriate circumstances); Satcher v. Satcher, 570 S.E.2d 535 (S.C. Ct. App. 2002) (specific performance available for promise of land when established by clear and convincing evidence). Section C of this chapter will offer more detailed discussion of specific performance.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03af5673-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Measure of recovery in construction bidding cases.</i> We saw in Chapter 3 that courts have generally followed the lead of the California Supreme Court in Drennan v. Star Paving Co., awarding damages on a promissory estoppel theory to the general contractor injured by the withdrawal of a subcontractor’s bid, despite the failure of the parties to conclude a formal contract binding the general contractor as well. As the <i>Drennan</i> case itself illustrates, the damage award in such cases will typically be computed by subtracting the defendant’s bid price from the price the plaintiff had to pay another subcontractor for the goods or services in question. Such a recovery might be regarded as reliance-based, but it seems apparent that the courts in such cases are really awarding a conventional expectation-based remedy, whatever the terminology they employ. In the <i>Dynalectric Co.</i> case cited in Note 3 above, the lower court had awarded to the plaintiff general contractor the difference between the defendant’s bid and the amount that the plaintiff had to pay another subcontractor to complete the work. Affirming this decision, the Nevada Supreme Court observed:</p>

<p id="03af5674-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Interestingly, despite the consensus that the measure of damages adopted in <i>Drennan</i> is appropriate in the type of situation presented here, courts have not definitively labeled this measure “expectation” or “reliance” damages. . . . Scholars appear to agree, however, that the <i>Drennan</i> measure of damages is, in fact, expectation damages. See . . . W. David Slawson, <i>The Role of Reliance in Contract Damages.</i> 76 Cornell L.

Rev. 52, 57 n.35 (1981) (noting the ambiguity in the caselaw on this issue and stating that an award of damages based upon the difference between the nonperforming subcontractor’s bid and the amount paid to a replacement subcontractor is “the classic expectation remedy”).</p>

Restatement (Second) §349. Modern contract law also allows a nonbreaching party to elect recovery of restitutionary rather than expectation damages for breach of contract. Restatement (Second) §373. Even a breaching party may in some cases be entitled to restitution by virtue of the benefit conferred on the other party by part performance. Restatement (Second) §374. Moreover, if the performance obligations imposed by the contract have been “discharged” for some reason, such as incapacity or impracticability, either or both of the parties may be entitled to restitutionary relief. Restatement (Second) §§375 (restitution when contract is unenforceable because of the statute of frauds); 376 (restitution when contract is voidable because of lack of capacity, mistake, misrepresentation, duress, undue influence, or breach of fiduciary duty); 377 (restitution when contract is discharged due to impracticability, frustration of purpose, or failure of condition).</p>

Blair had entered a contract with the United States for the construction of a naval hospital in Charleston County, South Carolina. Blair had then contracted with Coastal to perform certain steel erection and supply certain equipment in conjunction with Blair’s contract with the United States. Coastal commenced performance of its obligations, supplying its own cranes for handling and placing steel. Blair refused to pay for crane rental, maintaining that it was not obligated to do so under the subcontract. Because of Blair’s failure to make payments for crane rental, and after completion of approximately 28 percent of the subcontract, Coastal terminated its performance. Blair then proceeded to complete the job with a new subcontractor. Coastal brought this action to recover for labor and equipment furnished.</p>
<p id="03af7d92-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The district court found that the subcontract required Blair to pay for crane use and that Blair’s refusal to do so was such a material breach as to justify Coastal’s terminating performance. This finding is not questioned on appeal. The court then found that under the contract the amount due Coastal, less what had already been paid, totaled approximately $37,000. Additionally, the court found Coastal would have lost more than $37,000 if it had completed performance. Holding that any amount due Coastal must be reduced by any loss it would have incurred by complete performance of the contract, the court denied recovery to Coastal. While the district court correctly stated the “ ‘normal’ rule of contract damages,” we think Coastal is entitled to recover in quantum meruit.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN103C1_2c3aca9b-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N103C1_2c3aca9b-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">2</a></span></p>

Zara Contracting Co., 146 F.2d 606 (2d Cir. 1944), a Miller Act action, the court was faced with a situation similar to that involved here — the prime contractor had unjustifiably breached a subcontract after partial performance by the subcontractor. The court stated:</p>

The Tenth Circuit has also stated that the right to seek recovery under quantum meruit in a Miller Act case is clear. Quantum meruit recovery is not limited to an action against the prime contractor but may also be brought against the Miller Act surety, as in this case. Further, that the complaint is not <span title="1022" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1022">p. 1022</span>clear in regard to the theory of a plaintiff’s recovery does not preclude recovery under quantum meruit.

If, following Aristotle, we regard the purpose of justice as the maintenance of an equilibrium of goods among members of society, the restitution interest presents twice as strong a claim to judicial intervention as the reliance interest, since if <i>A</i> not only causes <i>B</i> to lose one unit but appropriates that unit to himself, the resulting discrepancy between <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> is not one unit but two.</p>

<p id="03af7d9a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The impact of quantum meruit is to allow a promisee to recover the value of services he gave to the defendant irrespective of whether he would have lost money on the contract and been unable to recover in a suit on the contract. Scaduto v. Orlando, 381 F.2d 587, 595 (2d Cir. 1967). The measure of recovery for quantum meruit is the reasonable value of the performance, Restatement of Contracts §347 (1932); and recovery is undiminished by any loss which would have been incurred by complete performance. 12 Williston on Contracts §1485, at 312 (3d ed. 1970). While the contract price may be evidence of reasonable value of the services, it does not measure the value of the performance or limit recovery.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN103F6_2c3aca9b-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N103F6_2c3aca9b-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">7</a></span> Rather, the standard for measuring the reasonable value of the services rendered is the amount for which such services could have been purchased from one in the plaintiff’s position at the time and place the services were rendered.</p>

<li class=""><p id="03afa4b2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Actions under the Miller Act.</i> Plaintiff’s claim was based on the Miller Act, which provides that in any contract for construction, alteration, or repair of any public building or public work of the United States in an amount in excess of $100,000 the contractor is required to furnish both “performance” and “payment” bonds issued by satisfactory sureties (normally insurance companies). 40 U.S.C. §3131. A performance bond protects the government against the contractor’s improper performance; if the contractor breaches, the government may demand that the surety complete or pay for performance of the contract. A payment bond protects subcontractors who supply labor or materials to the project against nonpayment by the contractor. If a subcontractor is not paid, he may bring suit against the contractor and surety under the payment bond. The suit is styled on behalf of the United States for the use of the subcontractor. As the court points out in footnote 2, while federal rather than state law governs claims brought under the Miller Act, both federal and state law recognize the right of the injured party to elect to recover restitutionary rather than expectation damages.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03afa4b3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Market value restitution.</i> The court of appeals in <i>Algernon Blair</i> held that when a plaintiff elects restitution as a remedy for breach of contract by the defendant, the “measure of recovery . . . is the reasonable value of the performance . . . and recovery is undiminished by any loss which would have been incurred by complete performance.” Several arguments have been made to support the rule of “market value restitution” followed by the court. If the plaintiff elects to rescind the contract and recover in restitution, the contract no longer legally “exists”; any loss that would have resulted from performance of the contract, therefore, should not act as a limitation on the amount of recovery. George E. Palmer, The Contract Price as a Limit on Restitution for the Defendant’s Breach, 20 Ohio St. L.J. 264, 273 (1959). In addition, it seems unfair to allow the defendant, who is after all the breaching party, to retain the benefit of the bargain. 1 George E. Palmer, Law of Restitution §4.4 at 393 (1978). See also Andrew Kull, Restitution as a Remedy for Breach of Contract, 67 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1465 (1994) (criticizing remedy on both historical and efficiency grounds). A majority of courts apparently follows the rule of market value restitution applied in <i>Algernon Blair.</i> See Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc. v. Bressler, 977 F.2d 720 (2d Cir. 1992) (restitution looks to value of benefit conferred and is not governed by terms of agreement; therefore, restitution is available even if nonbreaching party would have lost money on contract); IT Corp. v. Motco Site Trust Fund, 903 F. Supp. 1106 (S.D. Tex. 1994) (after breach of environmental remediation contract for $32 million, nonbreaching contractor allowed to recover more than $43 million in restitution; no Texas authority to limit recovery to contract price). See also Restatement (Second) §373, Comment <i>d</i> (adopting majority rule permitting restitution in excess of contract price).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03afa4b4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Full performance exception to market value restitution.</i> The right of a nonbreaching party to elect restitution in situations like that presented in <i>Algernon Blair</i> is subject to an important exception. If the nonbreaching party has fully <span title="1024" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1024">p. 1024</span>performed his obligations under the contract and the breaching party’s only remaining duty of performance is the payment of a liquidated or specified sum of money, the nonbreaching party may not elect a restitutionary recovery but is limited to expectation damages. Restatement (Second) §373(2). A leading case applying this “full performance” exception is Oliver v. Campbell, 273 P.2d 15 (Cal. 1954). In <i>Oliver</i> an attorney agreed for a fee of $750 to defend a husband in an action for separate maintenance brought by his wife. After the husband discharged the lawyer at the end of the trial, the lawyer sued to recover $10,000 in restitution as the reasonable value of his services. Although the California Supreme Court recognized the general rule of market value restitution as an alternative remedy for breach of contract, the court held that the full performance exception applied and limited recovery to the contract price. Id. at 20. But see Chodos v. West Publishing Co., Inc., 292 F.3d 992 (9th Cir. 2002) (after defendant breached contract by declining to publish finished manuscript, plaintiff author could elect to recover in quantum meruit because publisher’s obligation to pay percentage of gross revenue was not a “liquidated” debt). The Restatement asserts that the exception is justified because it protects the nonbreaching party’s expectation interest while eliminating the judicial burden of determining the market value of the performance. Restatement (Second) §373, Comment <i>b</i>. Is this persuasive?</p></li>

<p id="03afa4bb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This appeal raises the question of whether a defaulting purchaser of a business who has also entered into a related lease for the property can recover any part of his payments made prior to default. The common law rule precluded a breaching buyer from recovering these payments. Today, we reject this rule, which created a forfeiture of the breaching buyer’s payments and unjustly enriched the nonbreaching seller, and adopt §374 of the Restatement (Second) Contracts (1979), which permits limited restitution. This case is remanded for further proceedings so that the trial court may apply the Restatement rule.</p>

<p id="03afcbcd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On July 25, 1973, the parties entered into an agreement in which appellant agreed to purchase appellees’ luncheonette business and to rent from appellees the premises on which the business was located. Appellant agreed to buy the name of the business, the goodwill, and equipment; the inventory and real estate were not included in the agreement for the sale of the business. Appellees agreed to sell the business for the following consideration: $25,000 payable on signing of the agreement; appellant’s promise that only he would own and operate the business; and appellant’s promise to build an addition to the existing <span title="1025" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1025">p. 1025</span>building, which would measure 16 feet by 16 feet, cost at least $15,000, and be 75 percent complete by May 1, 1973.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10480_2c3aca9b-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10480_2c3aca9b-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">1</a></span></p>
<p id="03afcbcf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It was also agreed that appellees would lease appellant the property on which the business was operated for a period of five years, with appellant having the option of an additional five-year term. The rent was $8,000 per year for a term from September 1, 1973, to August 31, 1978. A separate lease providing for this rental was executed by the parties on the same date that the agreement was executed. This lease specified that the agreement to build the existing building [sic – the addition?] was a condition of the lease. In exchange for appellant’s promise to build the addition, there was to be no rental charge for the property until August 31, 1973. Further, if the addition was not constructed as agreed, the lease would terminate automatically. An addendum, executed by the parties on August 14, 1973, modified this agreement, providing that “if the addition to the building as described in the Agreement is not constructed in accordance with the Agreement, the Buyer shall owe the Sellers $6,665 as rental for the property . . .” for the period from July 25, 1973, to the end of that summer season. The addendum also provided that all the equipment would revert to appellees upon the appellant’s default in regard to the addition.</p>
<p id="03afcbd0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant paid appellees the $25,000 as agreed, and began to operate the business. However, at the end of the 1973 season, problems arose regarding the construction of the addition. Appellant claims that the building permit necessary to construct the addition was denied. Appellees claim that they obtained the building permit and presented it to appellant, who refused to begin construction. Additionally appellees claim that appellant agreed to reimburse them if they built the addition. At a cost of approximately $11,000, appellees did build a 20 feet by 40 feet addition. In the spring of 1974 appellees discovered that appellant was no longer interested in operating the business. There is no evidence in the record that appellant paid any rent from September 1, 1973, as the first rental payment was not due until May 15, 1974. Appellees resumed possession of the business and, upon opening the business for the 1974 summer season, found some of their equipment missing.</p>
<p id="03afcbd1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant’s complaint in assumpsit demanded that appellees return the $25,000 plus interest. Appellees denied that appellant was entitled to recovery of this sum and counterclaimed for damages totalling $52,000; $6,665 as rental for the property for the 1973 summer season and the remainder as compensation for “grievous damage to [appellees’] business, its good-will and its physical operation . . .” and appellee Lillian Thomas suffering “nervous illness, pain and suffering inclusive of serious bodily injury and necessitating bed rest and physicians’ supervision for one year after [appellant’s] default.” Defendants’ Counterclaim and New Matter, paras. 9-11. In his answer, Appellant only conceded liability for the $6,665 rent under the terms of the addendum.

<p id="03afcbd3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At one time the common law rule prohibiting a defaulting party on a contract from recovering was the majority rule. J. Calamari and J. Perillo, The Law of Contracts §11-26, at 427 (2d ed. 1977). However, a line of cases, apparently beginning with Britton v. Turner, 6 N.H. 481 (1834), departed from the common law rule. The merit of the common law rule was its recognition that the party who breaches should not be allowed “to have advantage from his own wrong.” Corbin, The Right of a Defaulting Vendee to the Restitution of Instalments Paid, 40 Yale L.J. 1013, 1014 (1931). As Professor Perillo states, allowing recovery “invites contract-breaking and rewards morally unworthy conduct.” Restitution in the Second Restatement of Contracts, 81 Colum. L. Rev. 37, 50 (1981). Its weakness, however, was its failure to recognize that the nonbreaching party should not obtain a windfall from the breach. The party who breaches after almost completely performing should not be more severely penalized than the party who breaches by not acting at all or after only beginning to act. Under the common law rule the injured party retains more benefit the more completely the breaching party has performed prior to the default. Thus it has been said that “to allow the injured party to retain the benefit of the part performance . . ., without making restitution of any part of such value, is the enforcement of a penalty or forfeiture against the contract-breaker.” Corbin, supra, at 1013.</p>
<p id="03afcbd4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Critics of the common law rule have been arguing for its demise for over fifty years. See Corbin, supra. See also Calamari and Perillo, supra, at §11-26; 5A Corbin on Contracts §§1122-1135 (1964); 12 S. Williston, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts §§1473-1478 (3d ed. 1970). In response to this criticism an alternative rule has been adopted in the Restatement of Contracts.</p>
<p id="03afcbd5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first Restatement of Contracts (1932) adopted the following rule:</p>

<p id="03aff2f1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many jurisdictions have rejected the common law rule and permit recovery by the defaulting party. See, e.g., Amtorg Trading Corp. v. Miehle Printing Press and Manufacturing Co., 206 F.2d 103 (2d Cir. 1953) (noting with approval §357 of Restatement (First) of Contracts); . . . Kulseth v.

<p id="03aff2f2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This development has been called the modern trend. See Quillen v. Kelley, 216 Md. 396, 140 A.2d 517 (1958). See also 12 S. Williston, supra, §1473, at 222 (cases permitting recovery are now the weight of the authority); 5A Corbin on Contracts, supra, §1122, at 3 (common law rule is broad statement not supported by the actual decisions). But see 1 G. Palmer, The Law of Restitution 568 (1978) (no valid generalization may be made regarding when a defaulting vendee can recover). It may be that the growing number of jurisdictions permitting recovery have been influenced by the widespread adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code §2-718. See, e.g., Maxey v. Glindmeyer, 379 So. 2d 297 (Miss. 1980) (allowing recovery of excess of seller’s actual damages in land sale contract by following <span title="1028" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1028">p. 1028</span>the logic of the state statute equivalent to §2-718 of the Uniform Commercial Code). Indeed, the common law rule is no longer intact even with respect to land sales contracts. See, e.g., Honey v. Henry’s Franchise Leasing Corp., 64 Cal. 2d 801, 415 P.2d 833, 52 Cal.

<p id="03aff2f3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Pennsylvania, the common law rule has been applied to contracts for the sale of real property. Kaufman Hotel &amp; Restaurant Co. v. Thomas, 411 Pa. 87, 190 A.2d 434 (1963); Luria v. Robbins, 223 Pa. Super. 456, 302 A.2d 361 (1973). In such cases, however, the seller has several remedies against a breaching buyer, including, in appropriate cases, an action for specific performance or for the purchase price. See Trachtenburg v. Sibarco Stations, Inc., 477 Pa. 517, 384 A.2d 1209 (1978). See also 5A Corbin on Contracts, supra, §1145. As long as the seller remains ready, able, and willing to perform a contract for the sale of real property, the breaching buyer has no right to restitution of payments made prior to default. See 5A Corbin on Contracts, supra, at §1130.</p>
<p id="03aff2f4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The common law rule has also been applied in Pennsylvania to contracts for the sale of goods. Atlantic City Tire and Rubber Corp. v. Southwark Foundry &amp; Machine Co., 289 Pa. 569, 137 A. 807 (1927). However, Pennsylvania has since adopted the Uniform Commercial Code, which, as to contracts for the sale of goods, has modified the common law rule by 13 Pa. C.S. §2718(b), which permits a breaching party to recover restitution. See note 2, supra.</p>
<p id="03aff2f5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The viability of the common law rule permitting forfeiture has also been undermined in other areas of Pennsylvania law. In Estate of Cahen, 483 Pa. 157, 168 n. 10, 394 A.2d 958, 964 n.10 (1978), the Supreme Court held that assuming that a breaching fiduciary could recover in unjust enrichment, the basis would be Restatement of Contracts §357 (1932), which allows recovery by a breaching party to the extent that the benefits exceed the losses sustained by the other party.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN104F8_2c3aca9b-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N104F8_2c3aca9b-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">4</a></span></p>

<p id="03aff2f8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In regard to the present case, §374 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts represents a more enlightened approach than the common law rule. “Rules of contract law are not rules of punishment; the contract breaker is not an outlaw.” Perillo, supra, at 50. The party who committed a breach should be entitled to recover “any benefit . . . in excess of the loss that he has caused by his own breach.” Restatement (Second) of Contracts §374(1).</p>
<p id="03aff2f9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This conclusion leads to the further conclusion that we should remand this case to the trial court.

<p id="03aff2fd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "></p>
<p id="03aff2fe-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I strongly dissent. In the first instance, the majority does not and cannot cite <i>any</i> Pennsylvania authority adopting the rule cited in §374 of the Second Restatement of Contracts. Although the ostensible basis for remand is the trial court’s reliance on outmoded law, the majority relies on law so new as to be virtually unknown in this jurisdiction. The law in Pennsylvania has been and continues to be that where a binding contract exists, and there is no allegation that the contract itself is void or voidable, a breaching party is not entitled to recovery. Luria v. Robbins, 223 Pa. Super. 456, 302 A.2d 361 (1978). While our Supreme Court may yet abrogate the forfeiture principle in this Commonwealth, it has not yet seen fit to do so, and we may not usurp its prerogatives, particularly when the result would be unjust.</p>
<p id="03b0190f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Secondly, the Uniform Commercial Code §2718, cited by the majority in (partial) support, is applicable only to the sale of goods, and, while it and some of the equally inapplicable cases referred to by the majority may be part of a trend, the mainstream of contract law in Pennsylvania has not yet been diverted by it. Indeed the identification of the jurisdictions cited as the vanguard of change is for the most part questionable, as of those states relied upon to confer legitimacy on the majority’s somewhat arbitrary conclusion, only one may be termed authoritative.</p>
<p id="03b01910-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lastly, and given the current state of the law, the most important determinant of the proper result in this case is the trial judge’s assessment of the witness’ credibility, here resolved in appellee’s favor. The majority, far from according these findings their due, ignores them, contrary to law and our mandate. Knepp v. Nationwide Insurance Co., 324 Pa. Super. 479, 471 A.2d 1257 (1984).</p>
<p id="03b01911-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court correctly points out that the understanding of the parties is clearly evidenced by the agreements they signed. In breaching those agreements, appellant has engaged in what might charitably be termed sharp practice. The facts reasonably support the inference that appellant learned the hoagie business, benefited from the acquired trade and good will at appellees’ place of business, then conducted the hoagie business at its previously owned pizza <span title="1030" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1030">p. 1030</span>shop in the following season. Restitution in this instance constitutes a wholly unmerited reward for bad faith. We do not feel that such a result is consistent with the intent of law or the expectations of equity.</p>

<li class=""><p id="03b01914-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Origin of breaching party’s right to restitution.</i> In 1931 Professor Arthur Corbin collected and analyzed the cases dealing with the right of a defaulting purchaser in a land contract to recover in restitution. He concluded that the right had been recognized in “too many thousands of cases to deny such a right to a vendee merely because he is in default.” Arthur L. Corbin, The Right of a Defaulting Vendee to the Restitution of Installments Paid, 40 Yale L.J. 1013, 1015 (1931). Corbin’s work led to the inclusion of §357 in the original Restatement, which recognized a general right to restitution in favor of a party in default. Section 374 of the Restatement (Second) is the current version of this doctrine.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03b01915-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Case law.</i> The court in <i>Lancellotti</i> cites several modern cases allowing a breaching party to recover in restitution, and decisions adopting the rule of Restatement (Second) §374 have continued to appear. E.g., Alstom Power, Inc. v. RMF Industrial Contracting, Inc., 418 F. Supp. 2d 766 (W.D. Pa. 2006) (even if subcontractor breached contract for installation of boilers, it could recover in restitution for benefit conferred in excess of harm to other party); Roberts Contracting Co. v. Valentine-Wooten Road Public Facility Board, 320 S.W.3d 1 (Ark. Ct. App. 2009); Eker Bros., Inc. v. Rehders, 163 P.3d 319 (N.M. Ct. App. 2011) (New Mexico will follow Restatement (Second) §374; <i>Lancellotti</i> cited and quoted). Not all jurisdictions agree, however. Two notable exceptions are Massachusetts and New York. Albre Marble &amp; Tile Co. v. Goverman, 233 N.E.2d 533 (Mass. 1968) (subcontractor not allowed to recover in quantum meruit for tile work that did not comply with contract specifications; quantum meruit recovery available only if party “can prove both substantial performance of the contract and an endeavor on his part in good faith to perform fully”); Intermetal Fabricators, Inc. v. Losco Group, Inc., 2000 WL 1154249 (S.D.N.Y.) (under New York law, builder who defaults on construction contract may not recover either under contract or on quantum meruit basis unless builder has substantially performed the contract). In support of the modern rule, the <i>Lancellotti</i> court also cites UCC §2-718, which provides for a right of restitution on behalf of a defaulting purchaser of goods. Notably, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court raised the question whether it should adopt the approach of §374 in a subsequent case, but it decided that dispute on other grounds without resolving the issue from <i>Lancellotti.</i> See Sevast v. Kakouras, 915 A.2d 1147 (Pa. 2007). Do you think the modern rule is superior to the common law rule? Why? Based on the Pennsylvania cases cited in the opinion, did the court in <i>Lancellotti</i> exceed its authority as an intermediate appellate court by adopting the modern rule?</p>
<span title="1031" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1031">p. 1031</span></li>
<li class=""><p id="03b01916-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Effect of willful breach.</i> As the court points out, the original Restatement provided that a defaulting party could not recover in restitution if the breach was willful and deliberate. Professor Corbin took issue with this portion of the section; this requirement, he asserted, showed a “childlike faith in the existence of a plain and obvious line between the good and the bad, between unfortunate virtue and unforgiveable sin.” 5A Corbin on Contracts §1123, at 7. Other commentators have agreed with Corbin. Robert J. Nordstrom &amp; Irwin F. Woodland, Recovery by Building Contractor in Default, 20 Ohio St. L.J. 193, 211-224 (1959). The language of §374 of the Restatement (Second) does not mention willfulness. Comment <i>b</i> to that section indicates, however, that an intentional variation from the terms of the contract (as distinguished from an intentional nonperformance) will preclude restitution: “A party who intentionally furnishes services or builds a building that is materially different from what he promised is properly regarded as having acted officiously and not in part performance of his promise and will be denied recovery on that ground even if his performance was of some benefit to the other party.” Does the dissenting opinion in <i>Lancellotti</i> suggest another possible doctrine that might limit the right of a breaching party to recover in restitution?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03b01917-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Measure of restitution.</i> We have seen in the <i>Jacob &amp; Youngs</i> case that a court may permit a party who has substantially performed a contract to recover “on the contract” even though his performance in some respect involves an immaterial breach. What should the measure of the restitutionary interest be when recovery is given to a party who has committed a material breach? Since the breaching party is seeking relief, not surprisingly, recovery is limited. The Restatement (Second) §374, Comment <i>b</i>, provides that recovery should be limited to the lesser of either (a) the value of the benefit conferred or (b) the defendant’s increase in wealth. In addition, to prevent the breaching party from recovering more than her expectation interest, the Restatement also provides that “in no case will the party in breach be allowed to recover more than a ratable portion of the total contract price where such a portion can be determined.” Restatement (Second) §374, Comment <i>b</i> and Illustration 3. Finally, to ensure protection of the nonbreaching party’s expectation interest, any damages suffered by that party must be deducted from the amount of the restitutionary award. Restatement (Second) §374(1).</p>
<p id="03b01918-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In some cases, a breaching party’s recovery in restitution will not differ markedly from the recovery that would have followed if the plaintiff had the benefit of the doctrine of substantial performance. E.g., Kreyer v. Driscoll, 159 N.W.2d 680 (Wis. 1968) (trial court found contractor had substantially performed and awarded contract price of house, less deductions for work not performed; appellate court holds that magnitude of work not done precluded finding of substantial performance but affirms award below on quantum meruit theory). In many cases, however, the plaintiff even if eligible for §374 recovery will receive little on its quantum meruit claim. E.g., Denver Ventures, Inc. v. Arlington Lane Corp., 754 P.2d 785 (Colo. Ct. App. 1988) (subcontractor entitled to no quantum meruit recovery because in light of large cost of completion, damages from breach exceeded benefit conferred).</p></li>

Titan also entered a “master licensing” agreement with DIC Enterprises that resulted in WWF T-shirts, trading cards, calendars, a computer game and numerous other items. In December 1984, Titan entered into a licensing agreement with A &amp; H Video Sales (d/b/a Coliseum Video) for the production of videotapes of WWF matches. Agreements with A &amp; H and Columbia House resulted in the production of approximately ninety videotapes of WWF performances involving Ventura.</p>

<p id="03b04039-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ventura began wrestling for Titan in Spring 1984 under an oral contract with Vincent K. McMahon, Titan’s President and sole shareholder.

After Ventura recovered, he returned to work for Titan as a “color” or “heel”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10619_2c3aca9b-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10619_2c3aca9b-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">2</a></span> commentator under an oral agreement with Titan. He was paid a flat rate of $1000 per week and there was no discussion of videotape royalties or licenses. Shortly after returning to work for Titan, Ventura executed a “Wrestling Booking Agreement” (WBA) with an effective date of January 1, 1985. Ventura subsequently resumed wrestling for Titan, for which he was paid according to the terms of the WBA. In March 1986, Ventura terminated his relationship with Titan in order to pursue an acting career.</p>
<p id="03b0674b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ventura’s foray into movies was moderately successful, but in fall 1986 he returned to Titan as a commentator, again under an oral agreement that made no mention of videotape royalties or licenses. In fall 1987, Ventura hired Barry Bloom as his talent agent. Bloom negotiated on Ventura’s behalf with Dick Ebersol, Titan’s partner in producing the “Saturday Night’s Main Event” show. However, the negotiations quickly broke down, and as a result, the first show of the 1987-88 season aired without Ventura. A few weeks later, Titan’s Vice-President of Business Affairs, Dick Glover, contacted Bloom concerning Ventura and represented to Bloom that Titan’s policy was to pay royalties only to “feature” performers. Because Ventura was interested in working for Titan, Bloom thought it wise not to attempt to “break the policy.” Ventura returned to work for Titan under a new contract that waived royalties and continued to work as a commentator for Titan until August 1990. Since that time he has worked as a commentator for WCW, Titan’s main competitor.</p>
<p id="03b0674c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In December 1991, Ventura filed an action in Minnesota state court seeking royalties for the use of his likeness on videotapes produced by Titan. The original complaint contained causes of action for fraud,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10627_2c3aca9b-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10627_2c3aca9b-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">3</a></span> misappropriation of publicity rights and quantum meruit. Titan removed the case to federal court, and the case was tried before a jury. Although only the quantum meruit claim was submitted to the jury, the jury was given a special verdict form concerning misrepresentation. Using this form, the jury found that Titan had defrauded Ventura and that $801,333.06 would compensate Ventura for Titan’s videotape exploitation of his commentary. The jury also determined that Titan exploited Ventura’s name, voice or likeness as a commentator in other merchandise and concluded that $8,625.60 would compensate Ventura for this exploitation.</p>
<p id="03b0674e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After the jury rendered its verdict, the district court concluded that Ventura was not entitled to a jury trial on his quantum meruit claim. Accordingly, the court vacated the jury verdict and entered findings of fact and conclusions of law that were consistent with the verdict. The court denied Ventura’s request for prefiling interest but granted prejudgment interest from the time the suit was filed. Titan appealed, and Ventura cross-appealed the denial of prefiling interest.</p>

Second, Titan claims that the district court erroneously applied the law of quantum meruit when it rescinded an express contract and awarded Ventura royalties for the videotape exploitation of his performance as color commentator during the 1987-90 (post-Bloom) period. Third, Titan alleges that the district court abused its discretion in qualifying and relying upon Ventura’s expert witness in awarding damages. Ventura’s cross-appeal presents a single issue: whether the district court clearly erred when it denied Ventura’s request for prefiling interest. We address each of these issues in turn.</p>

Salve Regina College v. Russell, 499 U.S. 225, 231, 111 S. Ct. 1217, 1221, 113 L. Ed. 2d 190 (1991). The basic contours of the law of quantum meruit, or unjust enrichment, are well settled under Minnesota law:</p>

<p id="03b06754-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An action for unjust enrichment may be based on failure of consideration, fraud, mistake, and situations where it would be morally wrong for one party to enrich himself at the expense of another. However, a claim of unjust enrichment does not lie simply because one party benefits from the efforts or obligations of others, but instead lies where one party was unjustly enriched in the sense that the term ‘unjustly’ could mean illegally or unlawfully.</p>

Although the applicable law is well settled, the facts of this case are rather unique and therefore require us to address some preliminary issues.</p>
<p id="03b06756-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first unique aspect of this appeal involves defining the benefit received (allegedly unjustly) by Titan. Titan makes much of the fact that Ventura provided no services for Titan other than pursuant to the Ventura-Titan contracts. While it is true that the Ventura-Titan contracts governed all the services provided by Ventura (i.e., his acts of appearing at the wrestling match and commentating), the agreements do not necessarily address all the benefits created by Ventura’s services. Ventura’s services created several varieties of intellectual property rights. In defining the “benefit” conferred upon Titan, the proper focus is not merely Ventura’s labor as he performed, but must also include the intellectual property rights created by Ventura’s performance. Thus, we find that the intellectual property rights to Ventura’s commentary are benefits upon which an action for unjust enrichment may be based.</p>
<p id="03b06757-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1035" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1035">p. 1035</span>We next must determine whether Titan, in taking this benefit, was <i>unjustly</i> enriched. Ventura’s quantum meruit claim may succeed only if Titan’s rights to use Ventura’s performance are limited so that Titan is not entitled to use the performance without Ventura’s consent. We believe that Titan’s rights are limited by Ventura’s right to publicity. In determining the law of the State of Minnesota concerning publicity rights, we are bound by the decisions of the Minnesota Supreme Court. If the Minnesota Supreme Court has not addressed the issue, we must determine what that court would probably hold were it to decide the issue. The parties have identified, and we have discovered, no case in which the Minnesota Supreme Court has either accepted or rejected the tort of misappropriation of publicity rights. We must therefore attempt to predict the decision of the Minnesota Supreme Court. In making our prediction, we may consider relevant state precedent, analogous decisions, considered dicta, scholarly works and any other reliable data. B.B. v. Continental Ins.

<p id="03b08e6a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, quantum meruit is not available simply because Titan may have been unjustly enriched.

Ventura’s services as a wrestler are governed by the WBA; his services as a commentator are governed by his oral agreements with McMahon. Thus, two contracts existed between Ventura and Titan between 1985 and March 1986, when the WBA was terminated. Whether quantum meruit recovery was proper depends upon whether or not the two agreements between Ventura and Titan were of limited scope, addressing only televised live performances, or also included subsequent videotape releases of the performances. The district court found that the WBA precluded royalties for the videotape exploitation of Ventura’s performance <i>as a wrestler.</i> The district court also found that Ventura and Titan had no agreement concerning the payment of royalties for videotape exploitation of Ventura’s performance <i>as a commentator.</i> This finding concerns the intent of the parties, Cepeda v. Swift &amp; Co., 415 F.2d 1205, 1207-1208 (8th Cir. 1969), and as such, is a factual finding which we review only for clear error. 1 Steven A. Childress &amp; Martha S. Davis, Federal Standards of Review §2.23 (2d ed. 1991) (“The clearly erroneous rule generally applies to a finding regarding the intent of the contracting parties, at least where the contract is ambiguous.”).</p>
<p id="03b08e6d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have reviewed the record, and are left with no definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. From 1985 to 1987, there was no discussion of Titan’s right to use Ventura’s color commentary. At least initially,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1068C_2c3aca9b-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1068C_2c3aca9b-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">8</a></span> Ventura was not aware of the impending videotape sales, as merchandising was not part of the industry practice. These facts support the conclusion that Ventura’s contract for commentating services did not contemplate a license for videotape distribution. Accordingly, we hold that the district court’s finding that the pre-Bloom Ventura-Titan contracts did not address videotape licenses or royalties is not clearly erroneous. See Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 105 S. Ct. 1504, 84 L. Ed. 2d 518 (1985). We believe that the judgment of the district court was correct insofar as it awarded damages for the exploitation of Ventura’s pre-Bloom commentating performances.</p>
<p id="03b08e6f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>B. Is Quantum Meruit Available for the Post-Bloom Period?</b></p>
<p id="03b08e70-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The post-Bloom contracts pose different issues. It is clear that Ventura performed commentating services between 1987 and 1990 pursuant to a series of contracts with Titan. It is also clear that the post-Bloom Ventura-Titan contracts included an arrangement concerning videotape royalties. Bloom specifically inquired about royalties and was told of the Titan policy. In reliance upon this purported policy, Ventura waived his rights to royalties. Titan contends that Ventura is not entitled to recovery in quantum meruit for the post-Bloom period because of the existence of express contracts waiving royalties. See <i>Sharp,</i> 347 N.W.2d at 271 (“ ‘It is fundamental that proof of an express contract precludes recovery in quantum meruit.’ ” (quoting Breza v. Thaldorf, 276 Minn. 180, 149 N.W.2d 276 (Minn. 1967))). Thus, the question reduces to whether Ventura may avoid the express contract waiving royalties and recover these royalties under <span title="1037" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1037">p. 1037</span>quantum meruit. We believe that the district court correctly concluded that Ventura was entitled to avoid the fraudulently induced contracts and to recover the reasonable value of the royalties.</p>
<p id="03b08e71-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . .</p>
<p id="03b08e72-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is well established under Minnesota law that unjust enrichment and quantum meruit may arise from fraud or several other predicates. See, e.g., <i>Holman,</i> 457 N.W.2d at 745; <i>Hesselgrave,</i> 435 N.W.2d at 863; Timmer v. Gray, 395 N.W.2d 477, 478 (Minn. App. 1986); Anderson v. DeLisle, 352 N.W.2d 794, 796 (Minn. App. 1984). Nothing in these Minnesota cases requires that all elements of a cause of action for fraud must be proved in order to use fraud as a stepping stone for quantum meruit. However, we begin with the elements of a cause of action for fraud under Minnesota law as a useful guide. See Davis v. Re-Trac Mfg. Corp., 149 N.W.2d 37, 38-39 (Minn. 1967) (listing elements of cause of action for fraud). Titan argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the necessary findings of materiality, inducement, justifiable reliance, causation and damages. We disagree. . . . </p>
<p id="03b08e73-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The evidence demonstrates that in 1987, Ventura hired Bloom to negotiate with Titan on his behalf. During negotiations, Glover told Bloom that Titan’s policy was to pay royalties only to talent featured in their own videotapes, such as the “Best of” videotapes. Believing it difficult to break Titan’s policy, Bloom negotiated an agreement under which Ventura agreed to perform for Titan as a commentator. The agreement did not entitle Ventura to royalties for videotapes of his performances, unless he was the featured performer. Ventura’s compensation did not include any payment based on videotape sales.</p>
<p id="03b08e74-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Between 1987 and 1990, Glover and Bloom met annually, in person or by telephone, to negotiate Ventura’s performance fees for each broadcast season, and occasionally for special performances. During each negotiation, Bloom asked Glover whether Titan had changed its policy regarding the payment of videotape royalties, and each time Glover reiterated that no talent received videotape royalties unless they were the featured performer on a videotape. Glover also told Ventura of this policy. Bloom and Ventura relied on Glover’s statements concerning Titan’s royalty policy, and understood that by entering into fee agreements they waived any right Ventura had to royalties. Despite these representations, Titan simultaneously made numerous royalty payments which were inconsistent with the purported policy of not paying royalties except to featured performers.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN106B8_2c3aca9b-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N106B8_2c3aca9b-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">10</a></span></p>
<p id="03b08e76-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In light of this evidence concerning Titan’s representations and its history of royalty payments, the district court concluded that from 1987 through 1990, Titan’s representations to Ventura that its policy was to pay videotape royalties only to featured performers were false. The district court also found that had <span title="1038" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1038">p. 1038</span>Ventura known that Titan did not abide by its stated policy, he would not have accepted a deal which did not compensate him for the reproduction and sale of his performances on videotape. The court further found that Ventura justifiably relied on Titan’s fraudulent misrepresentations of its royalty policy, and as a result Ventura suffered damages. Thus, the district court rescinded the 1987-1990 agreements, and permitted Ventura to recover in quantum meruit. In light of the abundance of supporting evidence, we find no basis for concluding the district court’s findings were clearly erroneous or lacked sufficient evidentiary support.</p>

<p id="03b08e78-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The court first concluded that the testimony of Ventura’s expert, Weston Anson, pertained to a material issue, the reasonable value of the services rendered by the plaintiff or the benefit to the defendant. — <span class="epub-small-caps">Eds</span>.]</p>
<p id="03b08e79-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We now turn to the related question whether Anson’s testimony was reliable. Titan argues that Anson’s testimony is unreliable because it is impermissibly speculative. In order to assess whether Anson’s testimony is reliable, we must focus on the methodology and principles underlying the testimony, not the conclusions they generate. <i>Sorensen,</i> 31 F.3d at 648. Anson arrived at his estimate of damages by applying a royalty percentage to Titan’s revenues from wholesale distribution of the tapes. The sales figures for the ninety videotapes upon which Ventura appeared were not available, but net profits (a more conservative measure) were established to the penny ($25,733,527.94). The main dispute concerns the royalty rate applied to this figure to generate the royalty that is the measure of damages. Titan’s expert figured damages in a similar fashion, applying varying royalty percentages and formulas to base amounts keyed to sales. Anson testified that a five percent royalty was the minimum that he would be satisfied with as an agent and was the single most likely rate, but that rates could range from 3.5% to 7.5%. When applied to the profits figure, these rates yield: $865,723.00 (3.5%), $1,236,747.00 (5%), and $1,855,121.00 (7.5%).</p>
<p id="03b08e7a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We believe that Anson’s methodology in arriving at the royalty percentages was reliable. Anson based his opinion as to the reasonable royalty upon a survey of thousands of licensing agreements. It is common practice to prove the value of an article (e.g., a videotape license) by introducing evidence of transactions involving other “substantially similar” articles (i.e., other licenses). 2 John H. Wigmore, Wigmore on Evidence §463, at 616-630 (James H. Chadbourn rev. 1979). Anson surveyed licensing agreements involving numerous sports and entertainment figures, App. at 487a (NFL), 489a (major league baseball), as well as various other types of characters. Although no individual arrangement examined by Anson was “on all fours” with the predicted Ventura-Titan license, in the aggregate, the licenses provided sufficient information to allow Anson to predict a royalty range for a wrestling license. We believe that this methodology is sufficiently reliable to support the admission of Anson’s testimony.</p>

<p id="03b0b58d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The district court did not clearly err when it determined that Ventura’s pre-Bloom contracts did not address videotape licensing and royalties. Accordingly, it did not err in permitting quantum meruit recovery of videotape royalties for the pre-Bloom period. Nor did the district court err when it awarded quantum meruit recovery for the post-Bloom period. We also find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in qualifying Anson, nor did it abuse its discretion in determining that Anson’s testimony was relevant and that the methods used by Anson were reliable. We further find that the district court did not clearly err in denying Ventura’s request for prefiling interest where Ventura’s potential damages varied by over 200% and where the amount was contingent upon the factfinder’s determination of unresolved issues.</p>

<p id="03b0b590-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I dissent from so much of the court’s opinion as allows Mr. Ventura a recovery for royalties before Mr. Bloom negotiated a contract for him. To state a cause of action for unjust enrichment in Minnesota, a plaintiff must show either on legal or equitable grounds, or based on principles of natural justice, that a defendant’s retention of a benefit would be unjust. Mehl v. Norton, 201 Minn. 203, 205-207, 275 N.W. 843, 844-845 (1937). In the court’s view, Mr. Ventura was deprived of a legal right to additional compensation because Titan infringed his right of publicity. I believe that the court has mistakenly allowed this recovery, however, because I do not think that a right of publicity exists under Minnesota law.</p>
<p id="03b0b591-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court finds a right of publicity under Minnesota law in the absence of any evidence that Minnesota’s courts would welcome this cause of action — and, indeed, a Minnesota Supreme Court case indicates to me that they would not. Minnesota has not adopted the tort of appropriation of name or likeness or any of the other torts collectively known as invasion of privacy, Hendry v. Conner, 303 Minn. 317, 319, 226 N.W.2d 921, 922-923 (Minn. 1975), and a right to one’s likeness is virtually indistinguishable from a right of publicity. . . . [I]t is highly significant that, in the year 1995, when everyone not only wants his or her fifteen minutes of fame but the concomitant television rights as well, no Minnesota state court has yet discovered a right of publicity in Minnesota law. The court has thus cited no “reliable data,” B.B. v. Continental Ins. Co., 8 F.3d 1288, 1291 (8th Cir. 1993), to indicate that Minnesota would recognize such a right. Titan was therefore not enriched in violation of a legal right recognized in Minnesota.</p>
<p id="03b0b592-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor has Mr. Ventura shown that it would be inequitable or violate natural justice for Titan to reproduce and sell the videotapes that it produced and on which Mr. Ventura was already paid to appear as an announcer without paying him additional consideration. The doctrine of unjust enrichment, it is true, may provide recovery for performing extra services not specified in an original contract, Sagl v. Hirt, 236 Minn. 281, 287, 52 N.W.2d 721, 725 (1952), but <span title="1040" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1040">p. 1040</span>Mr. Ventura does not argue that he performed any duties in addition to his commentary. One may also recover to prevent unjust enrichment if a benefit is conferred “unknowingly” or “unwillingly,” Galante v. Oz, Inc., 379 N.W.2d 723, 726 (Minn. App. 1986), but Mr. Ventura’s own testimony shows that he did not confer the alleged benefit unknowingly or unwillingly. More important, it is hardly unjust, from an economic viewpoint, that Titan should receive the full benefit from selling copies of the videotapes that it created. Titan, as entrepreneur, staged the wrestling matches, hired the various wrestlers, hired the announcers, and, above all, took the risks that the venture would fail to turn a profit. Now that Titan has been successful, Mr. Ventura wants additional compensation for having performed no additional work. If there is any unjust enrichment in this case, it is in allowing Mr. Ventura a recovery under these circumstances.</p>
<p id="03b0b593-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff cites Frankson v. Design Space Int’l, 394 N.W.2d 140, 145 (Minn. 1986), and Holman v. CPT Corp., 457 N.W.2d 740, 745 (Minn. App. 1990), for the proposition that when there is a lack of full agreement concerning compensation an employee may still recover in quantum meruit. That is no doubt so. But those cases are inapposite because each involved performances that had concededly not been compensated. The issue in each was whether sales employees would be allowed to recover commissions. In <i>Frankson,</i> the court held that the parties never reached an agreement about commissions and that therefore the plaintiff should be allowed a quantum meruit recovery. In <i>Holman,</i> plaintiff was terminated before she realized a commission on a sale that was virtually complete but still pending when she was fired, and the contract was silent with respect to whether a commission was due under the circumstances. Mr. Ventura, by contrast, performed and was compensated for his performances. He made an agreement to be paid a weekly sum rather than royalties for announcing wrestling events, and while he now regrets this less favorable arrangement, his regrets are not actionable under Minnesota law because one cannot recover for an unfavorable bargain. See <i>Galante,</i> 379 N.W.2d at 726.</p>

Nelson, a vocalist, was hired to perform with the Glenn Miller Orchestra. Miller paid him weekly according to union scale. Nelson sang six selections for a recording session and two more for a broadcast that also was recorded. Miller assigned all his rights in the records to the defendant, and in due course, defendant made copies of the recordings for sale. Nelson sued for an accounting for the sale of the recordings on which he sang, a 5 percent royalty on the records, as well as injunctive relief and damages. The evidence established that Nelson had no agreement with Miller entitling him to receive any royalties on the sale of phonograph records. The court ruled that “any right in and to phonograph records or other recordings in connection with the production of which plaintiff worked were the property of the plaintiff’s employer Miller. . . .” 148 F.

Mr. Ventura agreed to receive weekly pay to perform wrestling commentary. He does not dispute, as far as I can discern, that the videotapes belong to Titan. Mr. Ventura, like Nelson, is suing for a royalty on the sales of the recordings on which he performed. And like Nelson, Mr. Ventura deserves no recovery because he and Titan both performed under their contract and the recordings of Mr. Ventura’s performances now belong to Titan and it may profit from them as it sees fit.</p>
<p id="03b0b596-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, even if Minnesota recognized a cause of action for the breach of a right of publicity, and even if this case could be properly characterized, as the court seems to believe, as a dispute over the scope of a license of intellectual property rights (that is, publicity rights), I still doubt that Mr. Ventura should recover. Mr. Ventura himself testified that he was employed to “broadcast wrestling.” The agreement was therefore clearly susceptible to the construction that it authorized the sale of videotapes to end users. According to a leading copyright treatise, the preferred rule for copyright contracts when the intent of the parties is unclear is that the licensee may properly pursue any uses that may reasonably be said to fall within the medium as described in the license. 3 Melville B. Nimmer &amp; David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright §10.10[B] at 10-93 (1993). It follows “that a grant of the right to exhibit a motion picture by ‘television’ in its unambiguous core meaning refers to over-the-air television broadcasts, but in its ambiguous penumbra includes any device by which the motion picture may be seen on television screens, including cable television and videocassette uses.” Id. at 10-94. The ambiguity ought to favor the licensee because “it is surely more arbitrary and unjust to put the onus on the licensee by holding that he should have obtained a further clarification of a meaning that was already present than it is to hold that the licensor should have negated a meaning that the licensee might then or thereafter rely upon.” Id. I believe that this principle is recommended by reason and is applicable here because a right of publicity does not differ in any material way from a copyright. See Baltimore Orioles, Inc. v. Major League Baseball Players Ass’n, 805 F.2d 663, 679 (7th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 480 U.S. 941, 107 S. Ct. 1593, 94 L. Ed. 2d 782 (1987). Mr. Ventura testified that he was hired to perform commentary for television broadcasts. “Television broadcasts” under these circumstances must reasonably include dissemination of the videotapes containing the commentary that Mr. Ventura performed as part of his employment. Indeed, this seems to me utterly implicit in the original contractual arrangement.</p>
<p id="03b0b597-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the foregoing reasons, I believe that Mr. Ventura’s claim for additional compensation for his announcing duties in the period before Mr. Bloom negotiated a contract for him fails as a matter of law. I would therefore reverse that part of the judgment allowing Mr. Ventura’s recovery for his role as a commentator before he entered into the written contract.</p>

<li class=""><p id="03b0b59a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Governor Ventura.</i> Plaintiff Jesse Ventura eventually left professional wrestling and entered the political arena where he served as mayor of Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, before being elected governor of Minnesota in 1998. After serving one term, he decided not to seek reelection.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03b0b59b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Types of restitutionary claims in Ventura</i>. The majority and the dissent make a distinction between plaintiff Ventura’s claims for restitution arising during the time that he had oral contracts and his claims from the period when he had written contracts negotiated by Bloom. How do these two claims for restitution compare with the theories advanced in the first two cases in this section? The dissent disagrees with the majority only about the “pre-Bloom” claims for restitution. Part of the disagreement focuses on whether there is a right of publicity in Minnesota in the absence of a clear ruling by the state courts. Beyond that dispute about state law, however, the dissent also disagrees with the majority’s holding on whether Titan was unjustly enriched. Are you more persuaded by the majority or the dissent? More specifically, are you persuaded that Ventura conferred an uncompensated benefit “unknowingly” in the pre-Bloom performances?</p>
<p id="03b0b59c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The “post-Bloom” claim exemplifies a case in which restitution is sought after a contract has been rendered unenforceable due to fraud. As noted in the introduction to this section, the same reasoning applies if a contract is unenforceable for other reasons, such as mistake, incapacity, impossibility, duress, etc. What measure of restitution would be appropriate in such cases? See the following note.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03b0b59d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Measuring the restitutionary interest: enrichment or benefit.</i> In the late nineteenth century, when commentators first began developing the theory of restitution, it was often said that the basis of restitution was “unjust enrichment.” William A. Keener, A Treatise on The Law of Quasi-Contracts 19 (1893). See also Arthur L. Corbin, Quasi Contractual Obligations, 21 Yale L.J. 533, 550 (1912). Other commentators argued, however, that courts often awarded recovery in restitutionary actions even if the defendant was not in fact enriched. In his 1913 treatise on quasi contracts, Professor Woodward suggested that the measure of recovery should be based on the “receipt of benefit” rather than enrichment. Frederic C. Woodward, The Law of Quasi Contracts (1913). While the use of the word <i>benefit</i> seems to imply enrichment, the term was intended to refer to the value of what was received rather than the increase in the defendant’s wealth. The Restatement of Restitution, which was published in 1937, adopted this concept of benefit as the measure of recovery. Comment <i>e</i> to §1 provided that “a person who has been unjustly deprived of his property or its value or the value of his labor may be entitled to maintain an action for restitution against another although the other has not in fact been enriched thereby.”</p>
<p id="03b0b59e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Restatement (Second) of Contracts §371 recognizes both means of measuring restitution (reasonable value of the performer’s services and value of increase to the recipient’s property) and indicates that relief may be measured as justice requires. Cf. Maglica v. Maglica, 78 Cal. Rptr. 2d 101 (Ct. App. 1998) <span title="1043" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1043">p. 1043</span>(after jury awarded $84 million, appellate court reversed, holding that quantum meruit could be measured only by “reasonable value of the services rendered” and not by the “impact” on the business). Would these measures necessarily be different? Which measure would be more appropriate in <i>Ventura</i>?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03b0dcaf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Recovery of reliance damages in restitution.</i> A number of commentators have argued that courts should have the power under the theory of restitution to compensate for reliance damages or order some other equitable adjustment of the rights of the parties when a contract has been discharged because of impracticability or other similar cause. See John P. Dawson, Restitution Without Enrichment, 61 B.U. L. Rev. 563 (1981); Jeffrey L. Harrison, A Case for Loss Sharing, 56 S. Cal. L. Rev. 573 (1983). The Restatement (Second) appears to authorize courts to engage in such loss sharing, albeit in a somewhat roundabout fashion. Section 371 provides that in an action for restitution a court may “as justice requires” measure recovery either by the value of the performance rendered (the benefit theory) or the increase in value of the defendant’s property or interests (the enrichment theory). Comment <i>b</i> to §371 provides that the measure of recovery excludes expenditures “to the extent that they conferred no benefit.” This comment notwithstanding, other sections of the Restatement allow a court to award reliance damages when a contract is discharged for reasons such as impracticability. See Restatement (Second) §§158 (mistake), 272 (impracticability). See generally Joseph M. Perillo, Restitution in the Second Restatement of Contracts, 81 Colum. L. Rev. 37 (1981); William F. Young, Half Measures, 81 Colum. L. Rev. 19 (1981). See, e.g., Hart v. Arnold, 884 A.2d 316 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2005) (even though acts in reliance did not benefit buyer, seller of parcel of land was entitled to restitution plus reliance damages after governmental regulations made performance by buyer of promise to build lake impracticable but buyer failed to timely inform seller of the changed circumstances).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03b0dcb0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Proving restitutionary damages with reasonable certainty.</i> The defendant in <i>Ventura</i> challenged the sufficiency of the evidence offered to measure the restitutionary interest of the plaintiff. Is it surprising to find here the same problem of “certainty” that we have seen in connection with claims for expectation and reliance damages? Are you persuaded that the majority reached the correct conclusion on this issue? An example of the potential difficulty in measuring restitution damages with certainty is found in ATACS Corp. v. Trans World Communications, Inc., 155 F.3d 659 (3d Cir. 1998), <i>remanded at</i> 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15070 (E.D. Pa.). After the plaintiff subcontractor entered into a preliminary “teaming agreement” with the defendant to produce the successful bid for a Greek government contract worth more than $23 million, the defendant breached by unexpectedly awarding a contract to one of the plaintiff’s competitors for the work the plaintiff expected to perform. After finding that the plaintiff’s expectancy relief would be too speculative, the trial court also ruled that it could not quantify the value of the plaintiff’s services rendered in enhancing the defendant’s winning bid and thus awarded nominal damages of $1. The plaintiff did not seek and the trial court did not address a reliance-based measure of damages. Id. at 670. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals reversed on the issue of restitutionary damages, ruling that the trial court should have invited <span title="1044" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1044">p. 1044</span>the parties to offer expert evidence about the reasonable value of technical and consulting services in the market of government contracting and should have considered dollar savings realized by the defendant in later subcontracts made possible by the plaintiff’s earlier services. In remanding and essentially urging the trial court to make a greater effort to give relief to the nonbreaching party, the court of appeals stated that “equitable considerations must predominate over a parochial approach” to the remedies issue. Id. at 671. On initial remand, the trial court rejected the plaintiff’s request for more than $4 million in restitution damages as a disguised claim for lost profits and awarded the plaintiff only $18,900 based on the defendant’s calculation of the plaintiff’s costs in preparing technical submissions. After the appellate court rejected that award and remanded again, the trial court awarded the plaintiff restitutionary damages of $230,000 as a reasonable commission for facilitating the contract and another $20,000 as the reasonable value to the defendant of technical submissions provided by the plaintiff.</p></li>

<p id="03b0dcb3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Big Burger, Inc., is a corporation that franchises hamburger restaurants throughout the country. In June 2016 Emily Michaels approached Big Burger about obtaining a franchise. After reviewing literature from the company, Michaels visited several Big Burger franchises in other cities and hired a lawyer to represent her in negotiations; she spent a total of $15,000 in traveling expenses and legal fees.</p>
<p id="03b0dcb4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In August the parties signed an agreement in which Big Burger granted Michaels a franchise to sell hamburgers under its corporate name and agreed to construct and lease a restaurant to her. Michaels agreed to pay Big Burger a franchise fee of $100,000 and to lease the restaurant for a ten-year term at a fixed rental plus a percentage of sales. After resigning her job as a manager of a local restaurant, where she had been earning $40,000 per year, to devote full time to her franchise, Michaels purchased equipment for the restaurant from suppliers approved by Big Burger at a cost of $50,000. In January 2017 the restaurant was ready for operation.</p>
<p id="03b0dcb5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Within six months after the restaurant opened, disputes developed between Michaels and Big Burger. Michaels objected to the quality of some of the products she received from the company and to the company’s failure to honor a commitment to run a major advertising campaign. She also complained that her income did not meet company projections. During negotiations Big Burger had shown Michaels financial reports from comparable restaurants indicating an average net profit of $75,000 per year in addition to an average owner’s salary of $50,000 per year. After paying Michaels a salary of $20,000 per year, the restaurant was just breaking even.</p>
<p id="03b0dcb6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By late 2018 Michaels had become so dissatisfied with her situation that she decided to give up the restaurant. When negotiations with the company were unsuccessful, she decided to bring suit.</p>

<p id="03b0dcbc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As we saw in Chapter 10, some types of injury are not compensable in money damages at all, while the doctrines of foreseeability, certainty, causation, and mitigation may prevent recovery of damages even for compensable types of harm. It seems natural to wonder whether the plaintiff should not be able to avoid all these problems by simply asking the court to order the defendant to perform as promised. In the Anglo-American legal tradition, however, “specific performance” is not a remedy to which the plaintiff is automatically entitled, even when an unexcused breach has been clearly established. The following discussion by Professor Farnsworth explains the nature and genesis of the various limitations on the availability of specific relief.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03b0dcbd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The early common law courts did know specific relief, for many of the first suits after the Norman Conquest were proprietary in nature, designed to regain something of which the plaintiff had been deprived. Even the action of debt was of this character, since it was based on the notion of an unjust detention of something belonging to the plaintiff. But it became the practice in these actions to allow money damages for the detention in addition to specific relief, and with the development of new forms of action, such as assumpsit, that were in no way proprietary, substitutional relief became the usual form.</p>
<p id="03b0dcbe-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The typical judgment at common law declared that the plaintiff recover from the defendant a sum of money, which in effect imposed on him a new obligation as redress for the breach of the old. The new obligation required no cooperation on his part for its enforcement since, if the sum was not paid, a writ of execution would issue empowering the sheriff to seize and sell so much of the defendant’s property as was required to pay the plaintiff. . . . The judgment itself was seen as a mere declaration of rights as between the parties, and the process for its execution was directed not at the defendant but at the sheriff, ordering him to put the plaintiff in possession of real or personal property <span title="1046" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1046">p. 1046</span>or to seize the defendant’s property and sell such of it as was necessary to satisfy a money judgment.</p>
<p id="03b0dcbf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The enforcement of promises in equity developed along very different lines. . . . </p>
<p id="03b0dcc0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the influence of the canon law (for the early chancellors were usually clerics), decrees in equity came to take the form of a personal command to the defendant to do or not to do something. His cooperation was assumed, and if he disobeyed he could be punished not only for criminal contempt, at the instance of the court, but also for civil contempt, at the instance of the plaintiff. This put into the plaintiff’s hands the extreme sanction of imprisonment, which might be supplemented by fines payable to the plaintiff and sequestration of the defendant’s goods. So it was said that equity acted in personam, against the person of the defendant, while the law acted in rem, against his property. But it did not follow that the chancellor stood ready to order every defaulting promisor to perform his promise. Equitable relief was confined to special cases in light of both practical and historical limitations.</p>
<p id="03b0dcc1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The practical limitations grew out of the problems inherent in coercion. Our courts, like those of civil law countries, will not undertake to coerce a performance that is personal in nature — to compel an artist to paint a picture or a singer to sing a song. . . . Our courts have also been reluctant to order specific performance where difficulties of supervision or enforcement are foreseen, e.g., to order a building contractor specifically to perform his contract to repair a house. It has been suggested that in their origins these ideas carried a load of snobbery, expressed in distaste for menial tasks — “how can a Master judge of repairs in husbandry?” Today they are more often justified as a means of avoiding conflict and unfairness where no clear standards can be framed in advance. The practical exigencies of drafting decrees to guide future conduct under threat of contempt have also moved courts to require that contract terms be expressed with somewhat greater certainty if specific performance is to be granted than if damages are to be awarded. But these practical limitations are on the whole far less significant than the historical ones.</p>
<p id="03b0dcc2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The most important of the historical limitations derives from the circumstance that, since the chancellor had first granted equitable relief in order to supply the deficiencies of the common law, equitable remedies were readily characterized as “extraordinary.” When, during the long jurisdictional struggle between the two systems of courts, some means of accommodation were needed, an “adequacy” test was developed to prevent encroachment by the chancellor on the powers of the common law judges. Equity would stay its hand if the remedy at law was “adequate.” To this test was added the gloss that the money damages awarded by the common law courts were ordinarily “adequate” — a gloss encouraged by the philosophy of free enterprise, since in a market economy money ought to enable an aggrieved promisee to arrange a substitute transaction. . . . </p>
<p id="03b103d3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So it came to be that, in sharp contrast to the civil law approach, money damages were regarded as the norm and specific relief as the deviation, even where the law could easily have provided specific relief without any cooperation from the defaulting promisor.<span title="1047" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1047">p. 1047</span></p>
<p id="03b103d4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Land, which the common law viewed with particular esteem, was singled out for special treatment. Each parcel, however ordinary, was considered to be “unique,” and from this it followed that if a vendor defaulted on his promise to convey land, not even money would enable an injured purchaser to find a substitute. The remedy at law being in this sense “inadequate,” a decree of specific performance would ordinarily issue. Although the case for allowing the vendor to have specific performance when the purchaser defaulted was less compelling, equity also granted him relief. But no such reason applied to the contract for the sale of goods, for in a market economy it was supposed that, with rare exceptions for such “unique” items as heirlooms and objects of art, substantially similar goods were available elsewhere. . . . </p>
<p id="03b103d5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A second historical limitation, or group of limitations, is premised on the notion that equitable relief is “discretionary.” Since the chancellor was to act according to “conscience” (a circumstance that prompted the famous charge that his conscience might vary with the length of his foot), he might withhold relief where considerations of “fairness” or “morality” dictated. Some of the most renowned of these equitable restrictions are embodied in equity’s colorful maxims: “he who seeks equity must do equity”; “he who comes into equity must come with clean hands”; and “equity aids the vigilant.” . . . </p>
<p id="03b103d6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The historical development of the parallel systems of law and equity may afford an adequate explanation of the reluctance of our courts to grant specific relief; it is scant justification for it. A more rational basis might be the severity of the sanctions available under the contempt power for their enforcement. In any event, the current trend is clearly in favor of the extension of specific relief. The fusion of law and equity into a single court system at least facilitates a major change in this direction, and commentators have urged such a change. . . . </p>
<p id="03b103d7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Still, for the present, the promisee must ordinarily be content with money damages.</p>

<p id="03b103d9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1991, Professor Douglas Laycock published a major study of equitable remedies entitled The Death of the Irreparable Injury Rule. As his title suggests, Professor Laycock contended that regardless of what courts say by way of justifying their decisions, they do not in fact limit access to equitable relief by requiring the plaintiff to demonstrate that otherwise an “irreparable injury” will result (or that there is “no adequate remedy at law,” a principle that he equates with the requirement of “irreparable injury”). Instead, Laycock concluded that although this requirement is often invoked, it is virtually never decisive in fact: Courts grant or withhold equitable relief on the basis of a number of other, more particular policies, such as hardship to the defendant or others, hostility to the merits of the plaintiff’s case, or values such as freedom of speech or freedom from compulsory service.

By the terms of the contract, the defendants were to give plaintiff an opportunity to accept a lease on terms at least equal to those offered to other major department stores in the center. The court granted a preliminary injunction to prevent the defendants from leasing the last available department store site to another department store. Now the court is called upon to decide whether there is a valid contract and, if so, whether it is sufficiently definite so that specific performance of it should be decreed.</p>
<p id="03b103e1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants desired to construct a large shopping center on a tract of land near Tyson’s Corner, in Fairfax County, Virginia. In order to build the center, they had to persuade the Board of County Supervisors of Fairfax County to rezone the property for that use. By the time plaintiff came into the picture, defendants’ prospects for securing the necessary zoning were not good: the Fairfax County Planning Commission and the Planning Commission Staff had voted against defendants’ requested zoning. Defendants had to persuade the Board that these advisory groups were wrong in their recommendations. Moreover, defendants had an extremely strong competitor, the Rouse-Reynolds group, for another shopping center in the same general area. There was a zoning application for the Rouse-Reynolds center pending before the Board of Supervisors at the same time. Hearing on defendants’ application was set for May 31, 1962.</p>
<p id="03b103e2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During a period of time prior to May 31, Lansburgh’s Department Store, which is owned by City Stores Company, the plaintiff herein, had been negotiating the terms of a lease of a store site in the Wheaton Plaza shopping center with defendants Lerner and Gudelsky. In the course of meetings with Mr. Lerner, or Messrs. Lerner and Gudelsky together, Lansburgh’s president, Mr. Jagels, learned of the Tyson’s Corner proposal. Mr. Lerner asked for a letter from Lansburgh’s expressing a desire to participate in defendants’ Tyson’s Corner project, which could be used in the hearing before the Fairfax County Board of County Supervisors. Mr. Lerner had sought similar letters from other department stores in Washington, but found them unwilling to express a preference for defendants’ Tyson’s Corner site over the nearby proposed site of the Rouse-Reynolds group. Under normal circumstances, Lansburgh’s also would have been unwilling to express a preference for one site over the other. It was eager to obtain suburban department store sites for expansion purposes. But, for a reason which is a matter of dispute between plaintiff and defendants, Mr. Jagels wrote a letter to Mr. Lerner and Mr. Gudelsky (Plaintiff’s Exhibit E) in which he stated that it was Lansburgh’s conclusion that the Tyson’s Corner site <span title="1049" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1049">p. 1049</span>was preferable to any other in the area and expressing Lansburgh’s great interest in becoming a major tenant at a Lerner-Gudelsky shopping center if they were successful in their zoning application.</p>
<p id="03b103e3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants contend that plaintiff wrote this letter in order to secure defendants’ help in obtaining necessary permission from other department store tenants in the Wheaton Plaza shopping center for plaintiff to become another major tenant there. However, I find that this contention is not supported by the evidence. The evidence shows that during the period in question, plaintiff and Lerner-Gudelsky had not themselves reached agreement on rental and other terms for plaintiff to become a tenant in the Wheaton Plaza center, and that they were engaged in negotiations. It was not until November of 1962, by defendant Lerner’s own correspondence records, which are part of the evidence herein, that either plaintiff or defendants became aware that there would be an objection raised to plaintiff’s tenancy by Montgomery Ward, one of the major tenants at Wheaton Plaza with right of approval of other lessees.</p>
<p id="03b103e4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff contends, on the other hand, that the Jagels letter to Lerner and Gudelsky was written at Lerner’s request in exchange for a promise that plaintiff would be given an opportunity to become a major tenant at Tyson’s Corner on terms at least equal to those of other major tenants at the center.</p>
<p id="03b103e5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I find that on or about May 29, 1962, the Lerner-Gudelsky interests promised to give Lansburgh’s an opportunity to become a major tenant at the Tyson’s Corner center on terms at least equal to those granted other major department store tenants in exchange for assistance from Lansburgh’s in securing the necessary zoning for the tract. I further find that on or about May 29, 1962, the defendants Lerner and Gudelsky signed and gave to Lansburgh’s president Jagels the following letter concerning the defendants’ promise, and that this letter, together with plaintiff’s full performance of the requested services, is a sufficient writing to satisfy the Statute of Frauds, §12-302 D.C. Code. The letter is Plaintiff’s Exhibit B, and states:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">

<p id="03b12afa-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I also find that the services plaintiff performed for defendants, particularly the letter from Mr. Jagels which defendants used to support their case in the zoning hearing on May 31, constituted adequate consideration for a valid unilateral contract which was binding on defendants thereafter.<span title="1050" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1050">p. 1050</span></p>
<p id="03b12afb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>I</b></p>
<p id="03b12afc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff contends that this unilateral contract is an option for an opportunity to accept or reject a lease for a store at Tyson’s Corner on terms at least equal to those granted to other major tenants. Defendants deny that the agreement is an option contract and contend that, even if it were, it would not be sufficiently definite to be specifically enforced by this court.</p>
<p id="03b12afd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In determining the nature and consequences of this contract, it should be observed first that a typical option contract is a continuing offer for a fixed period of time (or a reasonable time if no time is specified) which is binding on the offeror because given for a valuable consideration. As noted by Williston, the word “option” is a business and not a strictly legal term. 5 Williston on Contracts §1441 (Rev. ed. 1937). An option contract is a unilateral contract as is the contract at issue. Generally, however, an option contract describes specifically the subject offered and all its material terms. The offeree knows at the time he receives the option exactly what has been offered and what he may accept or reject. It is obvious that the contract between Lerner-Gudelsky and Lansburgh’s is not of this description, and further analysis is needed to decide whether or not it may be classified as an option, despite its superficial dissimilarity to the usual form.</p>
<p id="03b12afe-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, it is clear that an option in typical form could not have been offered by Lerner-Gudelsky, because they had nothing but a contingency to offer at the time the contract was made. Any specific terms they might have included in their letter to Jagels would have been meaningless in view of the fact that they had neither received the necessary permission to construct their center, nor had they entered into leases with other major tenants which were to be the measure of the lease offered to Lansburgh’s. Yet it does not follow from this that what they did promise to offer Lansburgh’s was without substance. What we have here is a contract with certain conditions precedent to its operation.</p>
<p id="03b12aff-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first condition precedent to the Lerner-Gudelsky obligation to Lansburgh’s was the securing of necessary zoning for its Tyson’s Corner tract, without which it could not construct a shopping center at all. The second condition precedent was its entering into leases with other major tenants for stores in the center, so the terms of those leases could provide the essential terms of a lease to be offered to plaintiff. Defendants did secure the zoning, and they did, in the latter half of 1965, enter into leases with Woodward &amp; Lothrop and Hecht department stores. At the time it secured those leases, defendants were under an immediate contractual obligation to tender plaintiff a lease which in all its material terms would be at least as favorable to plaintiff as the two other leases were to their respective stores. That this would have been possible is entirely clear from the record: both the Hecht and Woodward &amp; Lothrop leases, Plaintiff’s Exhibit F, contain clauses to the effect that their terms will be at least equal to those offered to other lessees in the center. Thus, even though none of the stores in the center will be identical in design, it is apparent from defendants’ own leases that complete equality of material terms governing occupancy, including amount of space and cost per square foot, and substantially equal <span title="1051" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1051">p. 1051</span>terms on less material aspects of the lease, is within the customary contemplation of parties entering into shopping center agreements of the type at issue in this case. When it is recognized that a lessor’s success in a shopping center is directly tied to the success of all of his lessees, it must be conceded that as a practical business matter it is to the lessor’s advantage that one tenant be given no distinct competitive advantage over another traceable to the terms of the leases entered into.</p>
<p id="03b12b00-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I therefore hold as a matter of law that the Lerner-Gudelsky letter was a binding unilateral contract, which gave plaintiff an option to accept a lease at Tyson’s Corner, and that the existence of express and implied conditions precedent did not render it invalid or too indefinite to be a contract. . . . </p>
<p id="03b12b01-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>II</b></p>
<p id="03b12b02-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether the option contract secured by plaintiff in this case is sufficiently definite to be the subject of a decree for specific performance is quite another question, which does not concern the validity or existence of the contract but only the nature of the remedy available to plaintiff.</p>
<p id="03b12b03-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is not contested by the plaintiff that if it were to accept a lease tendered by defendants in accordance with the contract, there would be numerous complex details left to be worked out. The crucial elements of rate of rental and the amount of space can readily be determined from the Hecht and Woodward &amp; Lothrop leases. But some details of design, construction and price of the building to be occupied by plaintiff at Tyson’s Corner would have to be agreed to by the parties, subject to further negotiation and tempered only by the promise of equal terms with other tenants. The question is whether a court of equity will grant specific performance of a contract which has left such substantial terms open for future negotiation.</p>
<p id="03b15214-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendants have cited a number of cases in support of their argument that a court of equity will not grant specific performance of a contract in which some terms are left for further negotiations by the parties, or which would require a great deal of supervision by the court. I have examined those cases cited which were decided in this jurisdiction, because unless the precedents here establish a clear policy one way or the other, this court may exercise its discretion in fashioning an equitable decree. Moreover, this is an area of law in which not all jurisdictions are in agreement, and whichever way this court were to decide the case, there would be cases holding to the contrary in other parts of the country. . . . </p>
<p id="03b15215-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, defendants have cited no cases in this jurisdiction that would support the contention that an option contract involving further negotiations on details and construction of a building may not be specifically enforced.</p>
<p id="03b15216-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, the 1926 case of Morris v. Ballard, 56 App. D.C. 383, 16 F.2d 175, 49 A.L.R. 1461, held that an option to purchase property which contained a provision as to price “on terms to be agreed upon” was specifically enforceable by a court of equity. The court in that case held that “it became the duty of defendant, upon proper demand, either to accept the agreed purchase <span title="1052" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1052">p. 1052</span>price in cash or to specify such terms as were acceptable to him. He had no right to refuse arbitrarily and unconditionally to accept payment solely for the purpose of defeating the option. Such a refusal would operate as a fraud upon the plaintiff.” The court further held that the clause “on terms to be agreed upon” <i>“was in good conscience a stipulation that he would in fact agree with plaintiff upon reasonable terms of payment, and would not arbitrarily refuse to proceed with the sale. . . .”</i> [Emphasis added.] 56 App. D.C. 383, 384, 16 F.2d 175, 176. The court also quoted Pomeroy, Specific Performance §145 to the following effect: “when a contract has been partly performed by the plaintiff, and the defendant has received and enjoys the benefits thereof, and the plaintiff would be virtually remediless unless the contract were enforced, the court, from the plainest considerations of equity and common justice, does not regard with favor any objections raised by the defendant merely on the ground of the incompleteness or uncertainty of the agreement.” 56 App. D.C. 383, 384, 16 F.2d 175, 176. I therefore hold as a matter of law that the mere fact that a contract, definite in material respects, contains some terms which are subject to further negotiation between plaintiff and defendant will not bar a decree for specific performance, if in the court’s discretion specific performance should be granted. Walsh v. Rundlette, supra, adds further support to this position. See also 5 Williston on Contracts §1424 (Rev. ed. 1937).</p>
<p id="03b15217-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question whether a contract which also calls for construction of a building can or should be specifically enforced apparently never has been decided before in this jurisdiction. The parties have cited no cases on this point.</p>
<p id="03b15218-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the outset, it should be noted that where specific performance of such contracts has been granted the essential criterion has not been the nature or subject of the contract, but rather the inadequacy or impracticability of legal remedies. See 5 Williston on Contracts §1423 (Rev. ed. 1937); 4 Pomeroy’s Equity Jurisprudence §§1401-1403 (5th ed. 1941). Contracts involving interests in land or unique chattels generally are specifically enforced because of the clear inadequacy of damages at law for breach of contract. As Pomeroy says:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03b15219-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The foundation and measure of the jurisdiction is the desire to do justice, which the legal remedy would fail to give. . . . </p>
<p id="03b1521a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . The jurisdiction depending upon this broad principle is exercised in two classes of cases: 1. Where the subject-matter of the contract is of such a special nature, or of such a peculiar value, that the damages, when ascertained according to legal rules, would not be a just and reasonable substitute for or representative of that subject-matter in the hands of the party who is entitled to its benefit; or in other words, where the damages are <i>inadequate;</i> 2. Where, from some special and practical features or incidents of the contract inhering either in its subject matter, in its terms, or in the relations of the parties, it is impossible to arrive at a legal measure of damages at all, or at least with any sufficient degree of certainty, so that <i>no</i> real compensation can be obtained by means of an action at law; or in other words, where damages are <i>impracticable.</i></p>
</div>
<p id="03b1521b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is apparent from the nature of the contract involved in this case that even were it possible to arrive at a precise measure of damages for breach of a contract <span title="1053" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1053">p. 1053</span>to lease a store in a shopping center for a long period of years — which it is not — money damages would in no way compensate the plaintiff for loss of the right to participate in the shopping center enterprise and for the almost incalculable future advantages that might accrue to it as a result of extending its operations into the suburbs. Therefore, I hold that the appropriate remedy in this case is specific performance.</p>
<p id="03b1521c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some jurisdictions in the United States have opposed granting specific performance of contracts for construction of buildings and other contracts requiring extensive supervision of the court, but the better view, and the one which increasingly is being followed in this country, is that such contracts should be specifically enforced unless the difficulties of supervision outweigh the importance of specific performance to the plaintiff. 5 Williston on Contracts §1423 (Rev. ed. 1937). This is particularly true where the construction is to be done on land controlled by the defendant, because in that circumstance the plaintiff cannot employ another contractor to do the construction for him at defendant’s expense. In the case at bar, the fact that more than mere construction of a building is involved reinforces the need for specific enforcement of the defendants’ duty to perform their entire contractual obligation to the plaintiff.</p>
<p id="03b1521d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Cases from an early date have granted specific performance of construction contracts. In Jones v. Parker, 163 Mass. 564, 40 N.E. 1044 (1895), Justice Holmes commented:</p>

But this is no more than a court of equity is called upon to do whenever it takes charge of the running of a railroad by means of a receiver. Irrespectively of this, the decree is complete in itself, and disposes of the controversy; and it is not unusual for a court of equity to take supplemental proceedings to carry out its decree, and make it effective under altered circumstances. 138 U.S. 1, 47, 11 S.

<p id="03b17937-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendants contend that specific performance of this contract will result in hardship to them, and invoke the maxim that equity will not grant specific performance if the hardship to the defendants is greater than the potential benefit to the plaintiff. Defendants point to the fact that they agreed with Woodward &amp; Lothrop and Hecht in their leases to limit the number of major department stores in the center to three. That means that if a lease is granted to Lansburgh’s, defendants will be unable to negotiate a lease with Sears, which has expressed a willingness to be the center’s third department store tenant. The Sears lease would be more valuable to them, defendants claim, because the lease would be for a larger amount of space, and also because Sears would be expected to do a larger business than Lansburgh’s, and defendants would receive a percentage share of its profits over a certain minimum amount as part of the agreed rental.</p>
<p id="03b17938-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendants have not contended that performance of their obligation to Lansburgh’s would be impossible or would ruin them financially. In effect, their contention is only that they can make more money by dealing with Sears than with Lansburgh’s. This is not a reason for denying specific performance. Willard v. Tayloe, 75 U.S. 557, 8 Wall. 557, 19 L. Ed. 501 (1869). 5 Williston on Contracts §1425 (Rev. ed. 1937).</p>

Plaintiff was not responsible for these actions of defendants and should not be made to suffer irreparable loss due to the limitations which defendants have written into their contracts with Hecht and Woodward &amp; Lothrop and which they now assert as a basis for their refusal to honor their obligation to plaintiff.</p>
<p id="03b1793a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendants do contend that plaintiff was indirectly responsible, however, in failing to “press its claim” in May of 1964 when defendants advised it by letter that they considered themselves under no contractual obligation to plaintiff. First of all, I find from the record that at all material times the plaintiff through its officers did inform the defendants that it intended to hold them to their contract. Secondly, the defendants in effect imply that the plaintiff, by not “pressing its claim,” gave up its rights under the contract, or waived them. But it is elementary contract law that a release of a contractual right (as distinguished from waiver of a condition) is not valid unless made for a valuable consideration. Finally, in May of 1964 defendants’ obligation to tender a lease to plaintiff had not yet ripened because one of the conditions precedent to that obligation — execution of leases with other major tenants — had not yet been satisfied. Plaintiff could not have brought an action for anticipatory breach because of the impossibility of assessing damages; it certainly could not have brought an action for specific performance because as yet there was no specifically enforceable contract right. Plaintiff did contact defendants again when it learned that the Hecht and Woodward &amp; Lothrop leases had been executed; and it brought this suit in a timely manner to prevent the defendants from entering into a lease with Sears which would have precluded them from performing their contract with plaintiff. I therefore hold that plaintiff neither gave up its contractual rights nor unnecessarily delayed its assertion of them in this court. . . . </p>
<p id="03b1793b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During the course of this proceeding, the plaintiff has examined the leases executed between defendants and Hecht and Woodward &amp; Lothrop and has indicated its willingness to accept a lease with terms equal to the Hecht lease. I therefore find that the plaintiff has exercised its option, and is entitled to specific performance of a lease on terms equal to those contained in the Hecht lease.</p>

<li class=""><p id="03b1793e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Effect of indefiniteness on specific performance.</i> The court in <i>City Stores</i> begins its analysis by determining that an enforceable contract did exist, utilizing concepts familiar to us from our earlier discussions of agreement formation and consideration. The court then proceeds to decide whether the obligations imposed by the contract were sufficiently certain and definite to be susceptible to specific performance. Specific relief will not be denied merely <span title="1056" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1056">p. 1056</span>because the parties have left some matters out of their agreement, or left some issues to be agreed on in the future, particularly when the parties have agreed on all material terms and other equitable factors are present. See Restatement (Second) §362 and Comment <i>b.</i> See also Stanford Hotels Corp. v. Potomac Creek Assocs., L.P., 18 A.3d 725 (D.C. 2011) (where defendant seller breached obligation to bargain in good faith by refusing to sign negotiated contract for sale of hotel, court could order it to enter into contract and then order specific performance of the sale; <i>City Stores</i> cited and quoted). On the other hand, failure to agree on material terms may result in the denial of specific relief, though lines are difficult to draw. Compare Oglebay Norton Co. v. Armco, Inc., 556 N.E.2d 515 (Ohio 1990) (long-term contract for shipping of iron ore on Great Lakes specifically enforceable despite failure of agreed-on pricing mechanism; injury to plaintiff impossible to remedy by damages), with Honolulu Waterfront Ltd. Partnership v. Aloha Tower Development Corp., 692 F. Supp. 1230 (D. Haw. 1988), <i>aff’d,</i> 891 F.2d 295 (9th Cir. 1989) (four-page letter agreement did constitute binding agreement for real estate development but left too many material matters for future agreement to be specifically enforceable; virtually every provision contemplated further negotiation). Does the court in <i>City Stores</i> adequately weigh the indefiniteness factor in granting the relief requested?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03b1793f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Inadequacy of damages at law.</i> As the discussion by Professor Farnsworth indicated, contracts involving land are prime candidates for specific enforcement because land has been regarded in the Anglo-American legal tradition as unique, presumptively justifying equitable relief under the traditional rule that equity will act only where the remedy at law is “inadequate.” Modern American courts will routinely grant specific performance to purchasers of real estate. See, e.g., Sullivan v. Porter, 861 A.2d 625 (Me. 2004) (court may assume inadequacy of money damages in contract for purchase of real estate and order specific performance without actual showing of singular character of the realty); but see Meikle v. Watson, 69 P.3d 100 (Idaho 2003) (denying specific performance to buyer who merely planned to resell land). Restatement (Second) §360, Comment <i>e</i> indicates that specific performance has traditionally been available to both buyers and sellers. Cases awarding specific performance to sellers, however, are not very common. Compare Humphries v. Ables, 789 N.E.2d 1025 (Ind. Ct. App. 2003) (granting specific performance to sellers of property with a liquor store, based on mutuality of remedy principle and contract term that contemplated specific performance for the sellers, but also noting that only small number of cases grant the remedy to sellers), with Wolf v. Anderson, 334 N.W.2d 212 (N.D. 1983) (specific performance available to sellers only when equitable considerations warrant award).</p>
<p id="03b1a050-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Besides the possibility that a land-related contract will be specifically enforced because of the “uniqueness” of its subject matter, the Restatement (Second) in §360 identifies other circumstances which support a claim that damages are inadequate. These include the difficulty of proving damages with certainty, the difficulty of procuring a suitably equivalent substitute performance, and the likelihood that a damage award would not be collectible. See, e.g., Sokoloff v. Harriman Estates Development Corp., 754 N.E.2d 184 (N.Y. <span title="1057" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1057">p. 1057</span>2001) (plaintiffs properly stated cause of action for specific performance to obtain allegedly unique architect plans that were based on plaintiffs’ concept). To what extent are these factors concerning adequacy of money damages at work in the <i>City Stores</i> decision?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03b1a051-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Specific performance of development contract.</i> Another example of a court balancing the potential harm to the nonbreaching party with difficulty of court supervision is found in Franklin Point, Inc. v. Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank, 660 N.E.2d 204 (Ill. App. Ct. 1995). <i>Franklin Point</i> involved a plan to develop a parcel of land near downtown Chicago, pursuant to which the defendant, Harris Bank, agreed to purchase a portion of the property and construct a high-rise office building. Not surprisingly, many details of the construction plans were not established by the contract, but the agreement did establish an architectural review board to approve construction decisions not within the discretion of Harris Bank. Harris Bank purchased the property but failed to construct the building and the remainder of the project was not developed. The appellate court decided that the trial court erred in its ruling that “specific performance of a construction contract is barred as a matter of law.” Id. at 206. Citing <i>City Stores</i> and similar precedent, the court held that specific performance might be available if the presence of the review board would prevent the court from becoming embroiled in ongoing supervision of construction disputes. Id. at 208. Cf. Mayor’s Jewelers, Inc. v. State of California Employees’ Retirement System, 685 So. 2d 904 (Fla. Ct. App. 1996) (denying request for specific performance of lease by tenant because court would be required to supervise future performance). If it is assumed that Harris Bank was expected to be the “anchor” business of the Franklin Point development, how does the case for specific performance compare to that in <i>City Stores</i>?</p>
<p id="03b1a052-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ordinary building contracts are unlikely to be specifically enforced, both because of the difficulties of supervision and because construction services can readily be purchased on the market with a money award in damages. As cases such as <i>City Stores</i> and <i>Franklin Point</i> suggest, however, the courts are probably more willing than they were at an earlier day to decree specific performance in cases where some degree of service or labor will have to be performed by the defendant. See E. Allan Farnsworth, Contracts §12.7, at 754 (4th ed. 2004). Drawing a comparison to complex civil rights cases, Professor Farnsworth suggests that courts have discovered that the burden of supervision is not as great as might be feared. How does the test used by the <i>City Stores</i> court compare to that prescribed in Restatement (Second) §366 to determine when to grant specific performance even though court supervision will be required?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03b1a053-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Other factors affecting award of specific performance.</i> Besides the question of adequacy of the remedy “at law” and the problem of difficulty of supervision, courts of equity traditionally consider various other factors in deciding whether specific relief should be available. Some of these are listed in Restatement (Second) §364. These include the possibility that the contract was the product of mistake or unfair practices, or that the exchange it calls for is grossly inadequate or the terms of the contract are otherwise unfair. These factors are reflected in the doctrine that equity will not aid one who comes to the <span title="1058" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1058">p. 1058</span>court with “unclean hands.” See, e.g., Ingram v. Kasey’s Associates, 531 S.E.2d 287 (S.C. 2000) (tenant denied specific performance of option contract because he had unclean hands; tenant misled landlord into believing that he would not exercise option and he had ulterior motive for doing so).</p>
<p id="03b1a054-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another factor to be considered is the question whether specific relief would cause unreasonable hardship or loss to the party in breach. See, e.g., Webster Trust v. Roly, 802 A.2d 795 (Conn. 2002) (denying specific performance of “right of first refusal” contract allegedly triggered by intra-family transfer for $100,000 while land had $340,000 fair market value; sale to plaintiffs at lower price would have been “inequitable” and plaintiffs could still exercise option if land was sold in “market place” before the right’s expiration); Kilarjian v. Vastola, 877 A.2d 372 (N.J. Super. Ch. Div. 2004) (declining to award specific performance for buyers where seller’s health had declined significantly due to spinal muscular atrophy after contract was made, even though buyers were faultless and there is virtual presumption that nonbreaching buyers should receive specific performance). Should the potential hardship to the defendants have militated against the grant of specific relief to the plaintiff in <i>City Stores</i>?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03b1a055-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Effect on third parties.</i> Besides the possibility that specific relief may disproportionately affect the defendant, the court in some cases must consider the possible impact of its decree on third parties. Restatement (Second) §364(1)(b). Compare Craven v. TRG-Boyton Beach, Ltd., 925 So. 2d 476 (Fla. Ct. App. 2006) (denying award of specific performance to tenant in building project where enforcing commitment for location of plaintiff’s store would have required destruction of five new townhouses valued at $5 million, dispossessing the residents, and would have required judicial supervision), with Ruddock v. First National Bank of Lake Forest, 559 N.E.2d 483 (Ill. App. Ct. 1990) (specific performance of contract to purchase rare clock improperly denied where subsequent purchaser from defendant took with notice of plaintiff’s claim). The court in <i>City Stores</i> had previously granted a temporary injunction to prevent the defendants from leasing to someone else the last available site suitable for the plaintiff’s department store in the Tyson’s Corner shopping center, pending disposition of the plaintiff’s claim. If in the absence of such an order the defendants had actually entered into a binding lease agreement with another tenant, should that fact have precluded specific relief for plaintiff City Stores?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03b1a056-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Scholarly analysis.</i>  A number of writers have addressed the question whether there should be greater availability of specific performance as a remedy for breach. Favoring the traditional approach: Anthony T. Kronman, Specific Performance, 45 U. Chi. L. Rev. 351, 360-361 (1978); Edward Yorio, In Defense of Money Damages for Breach of Contract, 82 Colum. L. Rev. 1365 (1982). Arguing that specific performance should be the normal remedy for breach of contract because money damages are often undercompensatory: Alan Schwartz, The Case for Specific Performance, 89 Yale L.J. 271, 276-277 (1979); Peter Linzer, On the Amorality of Contract Remedies — Efficiency, Equity, and the Second <i>Restatement,</i> 81 Colum. L. Rev. 111 (1981).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03b1a057-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Specific performance under the UCC.</i> In §2-716 the UCC declares that specific performance “may” be decreed for a buyer where the goods are “unique,” <span title="1059" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1059">p. 1059</span>or “in other proper circumstances.” Comment 1 to §2-716 states that the section is intended generally to continue “prior policy,” but with a “more liberal attitude than some courts have shown” toward the granting of specific performance of contracts for the sale of goods. The comparable provision for sellers, §2-709(1)(b), allows goods to be forced on the buyer and the price obtained when the goods are not reasonably subject to resale to others. Under the Code’s approach, courts will still face the question whether the goods contracted for are sufficiently “unique” to justify specific enforcement. Compare International Casings Group, Inc. v. Premium Standard Farms, Inc., 358 F. Supp. 2d 863 (W.D. Mo. 2005) (specific performance of contract for hog casings appropriate for buyer where comparable goods were not available in market place and harm to buyer could be irreparable), with I. Lan Systems, Inc. v. Netscout Service Level Corp., 183 F. Supp. 2d 328 (D. Mass. 2002) (if UCC is treated as applicable by analogy to software licensing agreements, software at issue was not sufficiently unique to warrant specific performance). See also JNS Power and Control Systems, Inc. v. 350 Green, LLC, 624 Fed. Appx. 439 (7th Cir. 2015) (buyer properly granted specific performance of contract to purchase electric vehicle charging equipment in Chicagoland area together with leases for host locations; purpose of contract would be frustrated without transfer of actual chargers).</p></li>

<p id="03b1c771-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</b></p>
<p id="03b1c772-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant, Reier Broadcasting Company, Inc., owns several radio stations in Gallatin County and, until 2002, had exclusive rights to broadcast Montana State University athletic events. Respondent, Michael Kramer, is the head football coach at MSU. In January 2001, Reier Broadcasting and Kramer entered into an employment contract at the behest of MSU, whereby Reier agreed to pay Kramer $10,020 per year in exchange for exclusive broadcast rights with Kramer. Pursuant to the contract, Reier agreed to employ Kramer as an announcer and talent on the weekly, one-hour “Cat Chat” program, which airs during the MSU football season. [The Montana State football team is known as the “Bobcats.” — <span class="epub-small-caps">Eds</span>.] In addition, Kramer agreed to record commercials for <span title="1060" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1060">p. 1060</span>several of Reier’s advertisers. The agreement remains in force and effect until November 2004. Section Two of the contract contains an exclusivity clause that provides the following:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03b1c773-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That Coach shall diligently and faithfully serve Station in such capacity, shall devote his entire skill and energies to such service, and shall not perform on or permit his name to be used in connection with any other radio or television station or program, or to accept any other engagement which will conflict with his performance or effectiveness for Station, without prior approval and consent in writing by the Station.</p>
</div>
<p id="03b1c774-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reier Broadcasting had earlier purchased exclusive broadcast rights to all MSU athletic events. These rights expired in the summer of 2002, at which time MSU began seeking competitive bids from other broadcasting companies. After reviewing MSU’s Request for Proposal, under which these bids were to be obtained, Reier notified the university that there was a potential conflict between the Request for Proposal and Reier’s contract with Kramer. According to Reier, the Request for Proposal required the successful offeror to broadcast interviews and conduct a commentary program with Kramer in violation of Section Two of the Reier-Kramer employment agreement, under which Kramer was contractually prohibited from announcing, or otherwise providing talent for Reier’s competitors.</p>
<p id="03b1c775-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">MSU declined to amend the Request for Proposal to address this conflict. MSU then disqualified Reier Broadcasting as a potential bidder, and awarded broadcast rights to the university’s athletic events to Clear Channel Communications. MSU also notified Kramer that he was expected to provide interviews to Clear Channel despite the exclusivity clause contained in his contract with Reier.</p>
<p id="03b1c776-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reier Broadcasting subsequently filed a Complaint and Application for Temporary Restraining Order with the Eighteenth Judicial District Court in an effort to protect its rights under the employment agreement, and to prevent Kramer from providing services to Clear Channel. The District Court granted the request for a TRO, pending an evidentiary hearing on the matter. In August 2002, the court held an evidentiary hearing on the question of whether or not to convert the TRO into a preliminary injunction. The TRO was later amended to allow Kramer to “engage in audio, video or printed media obligations in connection with his coaching job. . . .”</p>
<p id="03b1c777-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After hearing testimony and reviewing the parties’ pleadings, the court concluded that §27-19-103(5), MCA [Montana Code Annotated], prohibited the issuance of an injunction under the circumstances. The court also dissolved the TRO. Reier Broadcasting moved to alter or amend the court’s judgment. The court denied the motion, and Reier appealed.</p>
<p id="03b1c778-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>STANDARD OF REVIEW</b></p>
<p id="03b1ee89-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Generally, when reviewing a trial court’s grant or denial of an injunction, our standard of review is for abuse of discretion. Spoklie v. Montana Dep’t of Fish, Wildlife &amp; Parks, [311 Mont. 427, 56 P.3d 349]. However, when a trial court <span title="1061" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1061">p. 1061</span>“ ‘bases its decision to grant such relief upon its interpretation of a statute, no discretion is involved and we review the [ ] court’s conclusion of law to determine whether it is correct.’ ” [<i>Spoklie,</i> 56 P.3d 352-353]. . . . </p>
<p id="03b1ee8a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>DISCUSSION</b></p>
<p id="03b1ee8b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This appeal concerns the scope and effect of §27-19-103(5), MCA, which provides the following: “An injunction cannot be granted: . . . (5) to prevent the breach of a contract the performance of which would not be specifically enforced. . . .” The paramount issue raised by the appellant, Reier Broadcasting, is whether, within the context of a personal services contract such as the employment agreement between Reier and Kramer, the language of §27-19-103(5), MCA, may be interpreted as prohibiting the use of injunctive relief to prevent one of the contracting parties (in this case, Kramer) from performing services elsewhere during the life of the contract.</p>
<p id="03b1ee8c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Characterizing the Reier-Kramer employment agreement as a personal services contract and not subject to specific enforcement, the District Court concluded that the prohibition contained in §27-19-103(5), MCA, precluded the issuance of the injunction sought by Reier. The court relied, in part, on §27-1-412(1), MCA, which states that, “[t]he following obligations cannot be specifically enforced: (1) an obligation to render personal service. . . .” Combining this restriction with the language of §27-19-103(5), MCA, the court concluded that it “may not enjoin one from doing something in violation of a contract if the [c]ourt cannot enforce the contract by specific performance. . . . The [a]greement between Kramer and [Reier] is a personal services contract and cannot be enforced by specific performance.” The court explained that it could not prevent Kramer from violating the terms of that contract without improperly enforcing the affirmative obligations of the Reier-Kramer agreement through indirect means.</p>
<p id="03b1ee8d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reier Broadcasting argues that neither §27-1-412(1), MCA, nor §27-19-103(5), MCA, applies in the present case. Reier contends that by seeking an injunction, the company did not intend to require Kramer to render personal services, but rather to prevent Kramer from providing the same services to Clear Channel. Accordingly, Reier asserts that §27-1-412(1), MCA, and its prohibition against the specific enforcement of personal services contracts, has no bearing on the present case, and thus §27-19-103(5), MCA, is equally irrelevant.</p>
<p id="03b1ee8e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reier characterizes its request for an injunction as an attempt to enforce a negative covenant which, according to Reier, is appropriate given that Kramer’s services are special or unique. According to Reier, contracts based on special or unique personal services, or in which a person holds a unique position, may be indirectly enforced by restraining the person from providing services to another. In support of this, Reier cites Volume 71, Section 165 of the American Jurisprudence, Second Edition, which states the following:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03b1ee8f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Contracts calling for personal services or acts of a special, unique, or extraordinary character, or by persons in eminence in their profession or calling who <span title="1062" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1062">p. 1062</span>possess special and extraordinary qualifications, may be indirectly enforced by restraining the person employed from rendering services to another. . . . </p>

<p id="03b1ee91-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reier also cites a 1972 decision, Nassau Sports v. Peters (E.D.N.Y. 1972), 352 F. Supp. 870, 875 (citations omitted), in which the federal district court for the eastern district of New York noted that “it has long been settled that injunctive relief may be granted to restrain an employee’s violation of negative covenants in a personal services contract. . . .” On this basis, Reier concludes that although Kramer should not be forced to fulfill his contractual obligations to the company, he nonetheless may be prevented from providing his unique services to Reier’s competitors until the employment agreement expires in 2004.</p>

<p id="03b1ee93-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Injunctions are rarely used to enforce contract rights or prevent breaches, and applicable court decisions concerning the propriety of this tactic are scarce. However, the legislature has set forth statutory guidelines for the use of injunctions. An applicable guideline is found at §27-19-103(5), MCA. Under this section, an injunction cannot be obtained “to prevent the breach of a contract the performance of which would not be specifically enforced.” A list of “obligations which cannot be specifically enforced” is found at §27-1-412, MCA.</p>

<p id="03b1ee95-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reier appears to accept this general premise from <i>Westland</i> that §27-1-412(1), MCA, identifies those contracts that cannot be specifically enforced, and that §27-19-103(5), MCA, prohibits the use of injunctive relief to enforce the affirmative covenants contained in such agreements. That said, the point of contention, here, is whether these statutory prohibitions also apply to the enforcement of negative covenants, such as the exclusivity clause contained in the Reier-Kramer employment agreement. Given the absence of any relevant Montana case law, we turn to the California and Arizona courts, which have interpreted statutes similar to §27-19-103(5), MCA, to prevent the enforcement of negative covenants in personal services contracts.</p>
<p id="03b215a6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Anderson v. Neal Institutes Co. (1918), 37 Cal. App. 174, 173 P. 779, the California Court of Appeals construed an early version of §3423 of the California Civil Code, which provided that “[a]n injunction may not be granted . . . to prevent the breach of a contract the performance of which would not be specifically enforced. . . .” In <i>Anderson,</i> the court of appeals identified two conflicting lines of authority under which §3423 could have been construed at the time. The first suggested that although a court cannot specifically enforce an affirmative agreement by compelling one party to perform, the court can enjoin a party from breaching a negative covenant and performing elsewhere. <i>Anderson,</i> 37 Cal. App. at 177, 173 P. at 780. The second line of authority suggested that <span title="1063" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1063">p. 1063</span>since a court cannot enforce the positive part of a personal services contract, it cannot restrain by injunction the negative part. 37 Cal. App. at 178, 173 P. at 780. The court of appeals adopted the later rationale, concluding that in light of the unambiguous language of §3423, a court cannot “interfere by injunction to prevent the violation of an agreement of which, from the nature of the [contract], there could be no decree of specific enforcement.” 37 Cal. App. at 178-179, 173 P. at 781.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A4E_2c3aca9b-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10A4E_2c3aca9b-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">1</a></span></p>
<p id="03b215a8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Arizona Supreme Court followed <i>Anderson</i> in Titus v. Superior Court, Maricopa County (1962), 91 Ariz. 18, 368 P.2d 874. The court reasoned that §12-1802(5) of the Arizona Revised Statutes, like §3423 in California, was intended “to deprive the court of jurisdiction to enjoin breaches of covenants not to compete during the original term of the contract (where enforcement would indirectly enforce the promise to render services).” <i>Titus,</i> 91 Ariz. at 23, 368 P.2d at 878. The court noted that the purpose of this rule is to prevent parties from “seeking injunctive relief to force the course of affirmative action.” <i>Titus,</i> 91 Ariz. at 21, 368 P.2d at 876.</p>
<p id="03b215a9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We determine that §27-19-103(5), MCA, like its California and Arizona counterparts, prohibits the use of injunctive relief to prevent a party to a personal services contract from performing services elsewhere during the life of the contract. The exclusivity clause in the Reier-Kramer employment agreement, if enforced vis a vis an injunction, would prevent Kramer from performing for Clear Channel or any of Reier’s other competitors until the summer of 2004 when the Reier-Kramer agreement expires. Thus, if Kramer were to perform at all, he would have to perform for Reier. In that sense, an injunction would amount to the indirect enforcement of the affirmative part of the contract. It was this sort of indirect enforcement that the California court sought to avoid in <i>Anderson,</i> stating that “to enjoin one from doing something in violation of his contract is an indirect mode of enforcing the . . . contract.” <i>Anderson,</i> 37 Cal. App. at 178, 173 P. at 780.</p>
<p id="03b215aa-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Following the lead of California and Arizona, we conclude that the issuance of an injunction, preventing Kramer from working for Clear Channel during the period remaining on his contract with Reier, would result in the indirect specific enforcement of the Reier-Kramer employment agreement. Contrary to the dissent’s characterization, we do not hold that the underlying contract was invalid. The issue presented is not whether the contract is valid, but rather, whether the <span title="1064" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1064">p. 1064</span>contract can be specifically enforced by means of an injunction. We conclude that pursuant to the explicit language of §27-19-103(5), MCA, Montana courts may not enjoin the violation of a contract, the specific enforcement of which is barred by Montana law. The issue of whether Reier has other legal remedies for the alleged breach of contract is not before the Court.</p>

<p id="03b215ac-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In summary, we hold that §27-19-103(5), MCA, prohibits the use of injunctive relief to enforce negative covenants contained in personal services contracts.

<p id="03b215b0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I dissent. As requested by RBC, I would reverse the District Court’s order dissolving the TRO and remand this case for a determination of whether or not a preliminary injunction should issue to prevent Kramer from providing his services to others in violation of the agreement between Kramer and RBC.</p>
<p id="03b215b1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I would conclude that the enforcement of the negative covenant in the contract between RBC and Kramer would not run afoul of §27-19-103(5), MCA. The court properly recognizes that the exclusivity clause in the agreement, if enforced by way of an injunction, would prevent Kramer from performing for Clear Channel or any of Reier’s other competitors until the summer of 2004 when the Reier-Kramer agreement expires. I disagree, however, with the ensuing conclusion the Court reaches, which is that an injunction would amount to the indirect enforcement of the affirmative part of the contract because, if Kramer were to perform at all, he would have to perform for Reier. I respectfully submit that this is a stretch. RBC is not seeking to compel Kramer to perform under the contract. It is simply seeking to prevent him from violating the non-competition provisions of the contract-provisions which were specifically bargained for by Kramer, at the encouragement and behest of MSU.</p>
<p id="03b215b2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition, I find the position taken by MSU in this litigation offensive. As the majority notes, RBC and Kramer entered into an employment contract “at the behest of MSU.” RBC alleges, and MSU does not deny, that representatives of MSU approached RBC for purposes of securing additional compensation for Kramer, after Kramer had been hired by MSU. An agreement was reached whereby Kramer would receive $10,200 from RBC, and in exchange would broadcast with RBC and no one else. MSU actively sought this benefit for Kramer and approved of the terms of the contract. A little more than a year later, MSU decided to award the exclusive rights to broadcast its athletic events to RBC’s competitor, Clear Channel Communications. It was only at this point — when the deal between RBC and Kramer ceased serving MSU’s interests — that MSU began to cry foul, claiming that the contract, which it solicited <span title="1065" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1065">p. 1065</span>in the first place, should be declared unenforceable. Laid bare, theirs is an argument born of convenience, not virtue.</p>
<p id="03b215b3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">RBC has fully and in good faith performed its obligations under its contract with Kramer, and for the first year, MSU and Kramer both accepted the benefits of the contract as well. Now, they want this Court to assist them in their breach. Many years ago this Court recognized that “[a] party who has secured to himself the benefits of a contract, and has accepted and used these benefits, has estopped himself in the courts from denying the validity or binding force of the instrument, or from setting up or asserting the contrary.” Brundy v. Canby (1915), 50 Mont. 454, 148 P. 315 (citations omitted). Numerous other courts have embraced this same legal premise: Once a contract is performed and a party has received the benefits of it, that party is estopped from claiming invalidity in order to avoid the contract’s burdens. See Seay v. Dodge (N.D. Ill. 1998), 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12005, 1998 WL 460273; Silling v. Erwin (S.D. W. Va. 1995), 885 F. Supp. 881; Smith v. Hornbuckle (1977), 140 Ga.

<p id="03b23cc4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the resolution I favor [allowing enforcement of the covenant not to compete for the duration of the contract] could stand alone, I would also conclude that MSU and Kramer were estopped from challenging the contract’s enforceability.

<li class=""><p id="03b23cc9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Equitable remedies and personal service contracts.</i> The parties in the <i>Reier Broadcasting</i> case did not dispute that the respondent Kramer contracted to provide services for the radio station or that he intended to breach that agreement. Rather, the dispute focused on whether an equitable remedy for breach would be available to Reier Broadcasting. You will recall from the <i>City Stores</i> case that one form of equitable relief is specific performance, in which a court compels a party to render a promised performance, based primarily on a showing that money damages would be an inadequate remedy. Without any need to address the adequacy of money damages, the <i>Reier Broadcasting</i> court briefly notes that Montana statutes prohibit specific enforcement of a personal services contract. The Restatement (Second) §367(1) is equally succinct: “A promise to render personal services will not be specifically enforced.” Why should there be such an absolute ban on enforcement of a personal services contract through specific performance? Comment <i>a</i> to §367 states the prohibition is based on reasons of both policy and practicality: the undesirability of forcing parties to continue in a relationship that has soured, potential concerns about involuntary servitude, and the difficulty of a court enforcing a decree for specific performance. Considering the nature of the contract in <i>Reier Broadcasting</i>, is it possible that Kramer could have been compelled to render the promised performance?</p>
<p id="03b23cca-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1066" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1066">p. 1066</span>While specific performance of a personal service contract will not be available, some courts have been willing to grant “negative enforcement” by way of injunction that prohibits a breaching party from performing for anyone other than the nonbreaching party. Such an injunction might be based on an implied promise that a party, such as the respondent in <i>Reier Broadcasting</i>, would not perform for another employer during the contract period. Alternatively, an injunction might be based on an express covenant not to work for others during the term of employment. See American Broadcasting Co. v. Wolf, 420 N.E.2d 363 (N.Y. 1981) (historically injunctions were initially available only if based on an express covenant not to compete with employer during the contract, but later became available if based on clear implication not to work elsewhere). The dissent in <i>Reier Broadcasting</i> founded its proposed resolution primarily on the presence of an express covenant not to compete. Is the dissent persuasive in its argument that Reier Broadcasting should have been allowed to seek an injunction?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03b23ccb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Historical perspective: Lumley v. Wagner.</i>  The granting of relief by way of injunction may be traced back to the early English chancery case of Lumley v. Wagner, 42 Eng. Rep. 687 (1852). In that case, defendant Johanna Wagner had contracted to appear in several operas in London at the opera house of the plaintiff, Benjamin Lumley, during three months of the 1852 season; as part of that agreement she promised not to appear for any other opera company in London during that time. Wagner thereafter agreed, in violation of her contract with Lumley, to appear in the Royal Italian Opera at London’s Covent Garden (for a salary higher than the sum that plaintiff had agreed to pay her). Lumley sought an injunction restraining Wagner from singing for his competitor, and the court granted him the requested relief. In the course of his decision, the Lord Chancellor conceded that under established principles his court would not have granted specific performance by ordering Wagner to sing for the plaintiff as promised. Nevertheless, the defendant had also expressly promised to refrain from singing for any competitor of the plaintiff during the period in question, which in the Lord Chancellor’s opinion made the requested relief appropriate.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03b23ccc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It was objected that the operation of the injunction in the present case was mischievous, excluding the defendant J. Wagner from performing at any other theatre while this Court had no power to compel her to perform at Her Majesty’s Theatre. It is true, that I have not the means of compelling her to sing, but she has no cause of complaint, if I compel her to abstain from the commission of an act which she has bound herself not to do, and thus possibly cause her to fulfil her engagement. The jurisdiction which I now exercise is wholly within the power of the Court, and being of opinion that it is a proper case for interfering, I shall leave nothing unsatisfied by the judgment I pronounce. The effect too of the injunction, in restraining J. Wagner from singing elsewhere may, in the event of an action being brought against her by the plaintiff, prevent any such amount of vindictive damages being given against her as a jury might probably be inclined to give if she had carried her talents and exercised them at the rival theatre; the injunction may also, as I have said, tend to the <span title="1067" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1067">p. 1067</span>fulfilment of her engagement; though, in continuing the injunction, I disclaim doing indirectly what I cannot do directly.</p>

<p id="03b23ccd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Id. at 693. This portion of the Lumley v. Wagner opinion acknowledges that an injunction might force a party to perform a contract that could not be specifically enforced, but seems to permit that outcome. In contrast, the state law cited in <i>Reier Broadcasting</i> seems clearly to prohibit an injunction as an indirect way of compelling specific performance. See also Restatement (Second) §367(2) (injunction will not be issued if probable result would be to compel an “undesirable” continuance of personal relations or “to leave the employee without other reasonable means of making a living”). What do you think would have been the practical effect if an injunction had been issued against the respondent in <i>Reier Broadcasting</i>?</p>
<p id="03b23cce-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whatever the artistic merits of Wagner’s vocal performances, her dispute with Lumley has guaranteed her at least a kind of immortality in legal circles. Besides the decision quoted above, making injunctive relief available in such cases, Wagner’s attempt to forsake Lumley for his competitor also generated a lawsuit by Lumley against that competing impresario, which culminated in the decision in Lumley v. Gye, 118 Eng. Rep. 749 (1853), establishing the modern tort of intentional interference with contract — and thus paving the way for Pennzoil v. Texaco, discussed in Chapter 2. See also Lea S. VanderVelde, The Gendered Origins of the Lumley Doctrine: Binding Men’s Consciences and Women’s Fidelity, 101 Yale L.J. 775 (1992) (discussing historical context of Lumley v. Wagner and observing that disproportionate number of early cases allowing injunctive relief in personal services contracts involved women defendants).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03b23ccf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Requirement that services be unique.</i> The majority opinion in <i>Reier Broadcasting</i> interpreted the applicable Montana statutes in a manner that would always bar injunctive relief in a personal services contract. While the court cited California statutes and case law as supporting its holding, the majority opinion also acknowledged in footnote 1 that the law in California was subsequently changed to allow for a possible injunction when an employee’s “service is of a special, unique, [or] unusual . . . character, which gives it peculiar value.” Indeed, in jurisdictions where injunctive relief is a possibility, courts will likely deny a request if the personal services are not unique. Injunctive relief may be available against employees whose services are not easily replaceable, such as athletes, artists, or media personalities, particularly when the employee plans to work for a competing enterprise. <i>Lumley</i> was such a case. See, e.g., Marchio v. Letterlough, 237 F. Supp. 2d 580 (E.D. Pa. 2002) (preliminary injunction issued against boxer to prevent breach of contract with promoter; boxer was unique talent and there existed risk of irreparable injury to plaintiff); Zomba Recording LLC v. Williams, 839 N.Y.S.2d 438 (Sup. Ct. 2007) (injunctive relief granted to record company to stop breach by artist with undisputed “special, unique and extraordinary” musical talents, as evidenced by Grammy Award nomination, pending determination whether plaintiff committed prior material breach).</p>

The reason appears to be an undemonstrated and unlitigated assumption on the part of the courts that professional athletics would collapse as an industry economically or competitively if injunctions against breach were not issued. Personally, I see little justification and no proof for this assumption.</p>

The <i>Reier</i> case involved a covenant restricting the coach from working for another radio broadcast <i>during</i> his three-year contract. You may recall from the Valley Medical Specialists v. Farber case in Chapter 7 that frequently employment contracts will include express <i>post-employment</i> covenants not to compete with the former employer. Such restrictions may be enforceable if the employer has a valid, protectable interest and the restrictions are reasonable. E.g., The 7’s Enterprises, Inc. v. Rosario, 143 P.3d 23 (Haw. 2006) (injunction granted to enforce three-year express non-compete agreement against ex-employee where employer gave unique training that constituted a protectable interest and ex-employee was not precluded from pursuing other work); Pinnacle Healthcare, LLC v. Sheets, 17 N.E.3d 947 (Ind. Ct. App. 2014) (where plaintiff doctor sued purchaser of plaintiff’s former practice for money owed, trial court erred in denying defendant’s motion for enforcement of plaintiff’s covenant not to compete; presence of liquidated damages clause did not preclude finding of inadequate remedy at law for defendant). Notably, California is a jurisdiction that has taken a policy position strongly in favor of the former employee’s ability to pursue a trade or profession and severely restricting the employer’s ability to enforce a covenant not to compete. See Edwards v. Arthur Andersen LLP, 189 P.3d 285 (Cal. 2008) (discussing California statute rejecting test of reasonableness and making noncompete covenants “void” except in limited situations).</p></li>

Although some of the policy problems relating to specific enforcement <i>against</i> the employee would not apply in this reverse situation (most notably the prohibition against “involuntary servitude”), the courts have nevertheless traditionally been unwilling to grant such relief. See, e.g., Nicholas v. Pennsylvania State University, 227 F.3d 133 (3d Cir. <span title="1069" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1069">p. 1069</span>2000) (tenured professor could not obtain reinstatement under breach of contract claim because court of equity will not grant specific performance of personal service contracts); Quadron Software International Corp. v. Plotseneder, 568 S.E.2d 178 (Ga. Ct. App. 2002) (employee not entitled to specific performance of software development contract absent showing of irreparable harm or inadequacy of damage remedy). When the employee’s claim is based on violation of a statutory provision prohibiting discrimination in employment, such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §2000e et seq., however, reinstatement is authorized and usually ordered. See generally Bergerson v. New York State Office of Mental Health, 652 F.3d 277 (2d Cir. 2011) (discussing award of reinstatement and alternative remedies).</p></li>

<p id="03b263e8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once a nonperformance (or defective performance) of an existing contract has occurred, it is within the power of the parties to agree to compromise or “settle” their dispute. By doing so the parties will in effect be agreeing on the remedy for breach. Absent some element of fraud, mistake, or duress, that agreement will almost surely be the final settlement of the dispute, with no occasion for judicial readjustment. Alternatively, it would be possible in such a case for the parties to stipulate between them the amount of damages that the one party had suffered from the other’s nonperformance, litigating only the issue of whether that nonperformance was indeed an unexcused breach of their contract. Again, if such an agreement is free from fraud, mistake, or other bargaining defects, it is unlikely to be judicially condemned: Such agreements save all those concerned — the parties and the court — the time and money that would otherwise have to be expended on a full trial of all the issues material to their dispute.</p>
<p id="03b263e9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose, however, that the parties as part of their original agreement (as opposed to a settlement agreement entered into after breach) specify the remedy to be awarded in the event of its breach. One might assume that such an agreement should simply be viewed as another bargained-out compromise of liability, to be accorded the respect that any freely bargained contract enjoys in our system. Indeed, in light of our studies so far, it could be plausibly contended that such an originally agreed-on remedy term represents the “expectation interest” in its purest, most easily ascertainable form and thus should enjoy the highest degree of enforceability. The agreed-remedy provision (often referred to as a “liquidated damages” clause, where a fixed or determinable sum of money has been specified in advance as the remedy for a particular type of breach) has not been so warmly received by the courts, however. Despite the obvious advantages that such terms can have for the parties and the court system, they are subject to judicial scrutiny and will not be enforced unless they <span title="1070" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1070">p. 1070</span>meet certain traditional tests. As reflected in the following case, courts make a distinction between a term aimed at compensation, and therefore enforceable, and a clause intended to penalize, and therefore unenforceable.</p>

Respondents, Andrew and Pamela Patch, are parents who enrolled their daughter, Christiana, in The Barrie School for the 2004-2005 academic year. The Patches entered into a re-enrollment agreement (the “Agreement”) with The Barrie School that contained a specific deadline for cancelling the Agreement. The Agreement stated that if respondents withdrew their child from The Barrie School after a specific date, respondents would pay tuition for the entire academic year as liquidated damages.</p>
<p id="03b28a04-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Agreement provided for a $1,000.00 non-refundable deposit and payment of the remaining tuition balance of $13,490.00 in two installments. The Agreement contained an escape clause that allowed for unilateral cancellation, provided that the head of the school received written notice by certified letter before May 31, 2004. Under §3 of the Agreement, respondents were obligated to pay the full tuition if they failed to meet the May 31, 2004 deadline for withdrawal. Section 3 of the Agreement provided as follows:</p>

Withdrawal, dismissal, absences or illness of Student during the year do not release me from any portion of this obligation.”</p>
</div>
<p id="03b28a06-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Patches did not cancel the Agreement on or before May 31, 2004.</p>

<p id="03b28a08-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Barrie School filed a breach of contract action against respondents in the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Montgomery County. The Barrie School sought the remaining tuition balance for the 2004-2005 academic year, plus 12% interest, and attorney’s fees. In their notice of intent to defend, respondents claimed that the Agreement had been procured by fraud, that it was a contract of adhesion, that the damages constituted a penalty, that The Barrie School had a duty to mitigate any damages, and that the Agreement was unenforceable because it violated public policy and Maryland’s anti-competition laws.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BB1_2c3aca9b-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10BB1_2c3aca9b-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">1</a></span> Respondents also filed a counter-claim, seeking the return of their $1,000.00 deposit, interest, and attorney’s fees.</p>
<p id="03b28a0a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case proceeded to trial before the District Court. Charles Shayler, the Chief Financial Officer of The Barrie School, testified for petitioner; Andrew and Pamela Patch testified on their own behalf. Respondents’ major argument at the close of evidence was that The Barrie School had a duty to mitigate its damages, notwithstanding the language of §3 of the Agreement.</p>
<p id="03b28a0b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District Court found that there was a valid contract between the parties, including a valid liquidated damages clause, that there was no fraud in the inducement to enter into the Agreement, and that the Agreement was not a contract of adhesion. Accordingly, the court denied respondents’ counterclaim. With respect to the liquidated damages clause, the court reasoned as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03b28a0c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“I am satisfied that it is a valid liquidated damages provision, that based on the testimony of Mr. Goss, that there was — it would have been next to impossible to assign an exact amount as to the impact of losing one child for the school year. And that in light of that, and the fact that A, it was agreed to by the parties, this was not a contract of adhesion, certainly as I understand a contract of adhesion to be. These people could simply have walked away from this. Their lives did not — did not depend on signing this contract. And that basing one year’s tuition or using one year’s tuition as the measure is certainly not unreasonable and in fact, Mr. Goss’ testimony was that it — probably the one year’s tuition probably represented less than the actual costs of educating the child at Barrie School. Okay, so I find the contract is okay, including the liquidated damages provision.”</p>
</div>
<p id="03b28a0d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court next addressed respondents’ argument that, notwithstanding a valid liquidated damages clause, a non-breaching party has a duty to mitigate damages. The court concluded that The Barrie School’s failure to mitigate damages was fatal to its claim, reasoning as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03b28a0e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“There is obviously the issue that I was most concerned with, and that was the issue of what effect liquidated damages has on the general rule that a party in — Plaintiff in the face of a breach does have some duty to mitigate.</p>
<p id="03b28a0f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">* * *<span title="1072" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1072">p. 1072</span></p>
<p id="03b28a10-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if the amount is difficult to determine, I don’t see why in the world they still shouldn’t do something to mitigate. And again, even if the tuition amount does not exactly hit the number, it sure comes close to it in terms of going toward making them whole.</p>
<p id="03b28a11-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And it’s unquestionable that they did absolutely nothing whatsoever to try to fill the space for this child once they got the word in July that she was — that she was not going to be there. They — they didn’t go through their old applications, they didn’t put out any advertisements. They did absolutely nothing. And I understand there is the black letter rule. But I think even black letter rules are subject to some exception, and I don’t see why, under the circumstances of this case, when they — even if it couldn’t exactly correspond to exact amount that they would have been harmed, they — again, could have done a lot to have helped themselves out, at least to the extent of the amount they’re suing for in this case. And that their failure to do so I do find to be fatal.</p>
<p id="03b2b122-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So for that reason I’m going to also grant a Defendants’ verdict on The Barrie School as Plaintiff.”</p>

<p id="03b2b123-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court entered judgment in favor of respondents on The Barrie School claim.</p>
<p id="03b2b124-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Barrie School noted a timely appeal. . . . </p>
<p id="03b2b125-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a written opinion, the Circuit Court agreed with the District Court and held that even though the liquidated damages clause was valid and not a penalty, The Barrie School had a duty to mitigate damages. . . . The Circuit Court stated as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03b2b126-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“The question is presented as to whether a party who is protected by a liquidated damages clause in a contract is excused of the normal contractual duty to mitigate its damages as a prerequisite to recovery. The court finds that such a duty does exist, notwithstanding the existence of a liquidated damages clause, and, thus, the District Court did not err as a matter of law in so finding. It is interesting to note that while no evidence of mitigation was presented, it would appear that mitigation had, in effect, already occurred when The Barrie School already enrolled more students than its budget projections called for.”</p>
</div>
<p id="03b2b127-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We granted The Barrie School’s petition for a writ of certiorari to this Court. . . . </p>

<p id="03b2b129-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before this Court, The Barrie School argues that a non-breaching party has no duty to mitigate damages where the parties have agreed to a valid liquidated sum in the event of breach. The school states that it is well settled that liquidated damages clauses are recognized and enforced in Maryland and that, when valid, such clauses do not require the injured party to reduce the agreed-upon amount by avoiding loss. . . . </p>
<p id="03b2b12a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents do not appear to controvert petitioner’s argument that there exists a liquidated damages clause in the Agreement. Rather, respondents argue that the general law of contracts, i.e., the general duty to mitigate damages in the event of a breach, applies to a contract containing a liquidated damages provision. Respondents argue that the purpose of a liquidated damages clause is “solely to agree on the <i>amount</i> of damages,” stating that “it does not have and should not have any effect on whether avoidable damages should be mitigated.” <span title="1073" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1073">p. 1073</span>In addition to their mitigation argument, respondents contend that The Barrie School suffered no actual damages from the breach because it enrolled more students than originally expected in the 2004-2005 enrollment projections. . . . </p>
<p id="03b2b12b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>III.</b></p>
<p id="03b2b12c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Liquidated damages have been defined as a specific sum stipulated to and agreed upon by the parties at the time they entered into a contract, to be paid to compensate for injuries in the event of a breach of that contract. Board of Education v. Heister, 392 Md. 140, 155, 896 A.2d 342, 351 (2006) (stating that a liquidated damages clause is “a specific sum of money . . . expressly stipulated by the parties to a . . . contract as the amount of damages to be recovered by either party for a breach of the agreement by the other”). Whether a contract provision is a penalty or a valid liquidated damages clause is a question of law, reviewed <i>de novo</i> by this Court. Id. See also Hammaker v. Schleigh, 157 Md. 652, 667, 147 A. 790, 796 (1929).</p>
<p id="03b2b12d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because respondents seek to set aside the bargained for contractual provision in the Agreement stipulating damages in the event of breach, respondents have the burden of proving that the clause should not be enforced. Placing the burden of proof on the challenger is consistent with giving the non-breaching party the advantage inherent in stipulated damages clauses, that of eliminating the need to prove damages, and with the general principle of Maryland law that assumes that bargains are enforceable and that the party asking the court to invalidate a bargain should demonstrate the justice of his or her view. See Dashiell v. Meeks, 396 Md. 149, 167, 913 A.2d 10, 20 (2006).</p>
<p id="03b2b12e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It has long been the rule in Maryland that valid liquidated damages provisions are enforceable. Our predecessors stated “the settled rule of law” with respect to liquidated damages as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03b2d83f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“[W]here the parties, at or before the time of the execution of the contract, agree upon and name a sum therein to be paid as liquidated damages, in lieu of anticipated damages which are in their nature uncertain and incapable of exact ascertainment, that the amount so named in the agreement will be regarded as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, unless the amount so agreed upon and inserted in the agreement be grossly excessive and out of all proportion to the damages that might reasonably have been expected to result from such breach of the contract. And whether it is excessive or whether the damages are incapable of exact ascertainment should be determined from the subject-matter of the contract considered in the light of all the surrounding facts and circumstances connected therewith and known to the parties at the time of its execution. That these questions should be considered and determined from the contract itself, its subject-matter and the surrounding facts and circumstances connected therewith with which the parties are confronted at the time of its execution, is made necessary in order to ascertain the intention of the parties, which is one of the essential factors in deciding whether the stipulation is for liquidated damages or is a penalty. It may afterwards be disclosed that the damages actually sustained are more or less than those anticipated at the time of the execution of the contract. If more, this fact would not characterize or stamp the stipulation as a penalty unless it was so exorbitant as to clearly show that such <span title="1074" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1074">p. 1074</span>amount was not arrived at in a <i>bona fide</i> effort, made at or before the execution of the contract, to estimate the damages that might have been reasonably expected to result from a breach of it, and that it was named as a penalty for such breach. And on the other hand, if the amount stipulated was found to be inadequate, a greater amount could not be recovered for such breach, because of the agreement between the parties that the amount so named should be in lieu of the damages resulting therefrom.”</p>

This Court has not strayed from the notion that, absent specific statutory provisions, the time of contract formation is the appropriate point from which to judge the reasonableness of a liquidated damages provision.</p>
<p id="03b2d841-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Writing for this Court, Judge Harrell elucidated more recently the elements of a liquidated damages provision, stating as follows:</p>

<p id="03b2d842-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“There are three essential elements of a valid and enforceable liquidated damages clause. First, such a clause must provide in clear and unambiguous terms for a certain sum. Secondly, the liquidated damages must reasonably be compensation for the damages anticipated by the breach. Thirdly, liquidated damage clauses are by their nature mandatory binding agreements before the fact which may not be altered to correspond to actual damages determined after the fact. While the language used by the parties is instructive in determining the validity of a liquidated damages clause, the decisive element is the intention of the parties — whether they intended that the sum be a penalty or an agreed-upon amount as damages in case of a breach and this is to be gleaned from the subject matter, the language of the contract and the circumstances surrounding its execution.”</p>

Willson v. M. &amp; C. C. of Baltimore, 83 Md. 203, 211, 34 A. 774, 775 (1896).

As we made clear in <i>Circuit City</i>, mitigation of <span title="1076" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1076">p. 1076</span>damages helps to determine the proper amount of damages resulting from a breach of contract.

<p id="03b2ff5f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Liquidated damages differ fundamentally from mitigation of damages. While mitigation is part of a court’s determination of actual damages that have resulted from a breach of contract, liquidated damages clauses are the remedy the parties to a contract have determined to be proper in the event of breach. Where the parties to a contract have included a reasonable sum that stipulates damages in the event of breach, that sum replaces any determination of actual loss. Professor Williston has explained this principle as follows:</p>

<p id="03b2ff60-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“[O]ne purpose of a liquidated damages provision is to obviate the need for the nonbreaching party to prove actual damages. Thus, where the liquidated damages clause represents a reasonable attempt by the parties to agree in advance upon a sum that will compensate the nonbreacher for any harm caused by the breach, in lieu of the compensatory contract damage to which the nonbreacher would otherwise be entitled, the clause will be upheld.”</p>

See also 11 Arthur Linton Corbin, Corbin on Contracts §1062, at 307 (interim ed. 2002) (stating that a valid liquidation of damages makes other proof as to the amount of injury unnecessary). It follows naturally that once a court has determined that a liquidated damages clause is valid, it need not make further inquiries as to actual damages. This includes a determination of whether the parties attempted to mitigate damages resulting from breach.</p>
<p id="03b2ff62-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Judge Richard Posner of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit noted the distinction between liquidated damages and the duty to mitigate in Lake River Corp. v. Carborundum Co., 769 F.2d 1284 (7th Cir. 1985). That case involved a shipping contract in which one party to the contract failed to fulfill the terms of the agreement after market prices shifted. Although the court found that the contractual clause at issue was invalid as a penalty, the court nonetheless explained the distinction between mitigation of damages and liquidated damages, stating as follows:</p>

<p id="03b2ff65-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As Judge Posner noted in <i>Lake River Corp.</i>, the purpose of §3 of the Agreement would be “blunted” if The Barrie School were required to mitigate damages. The parties to the Agreement determined that a certain sum would be paid in order to avoid the necessity of determining actual damages that might have resulted from breach. As a necessary conclusion, §3 of the Agreement was a <span title="1077" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1077">p. 1077</span>comprehensive sum that eliminated the need to calculate actual losses, including any mitigation of damages that might have occurred. Maryland’s approach to liquidated damages supports this conclusion, as we view such clauses as “binding agreements <i>before the fact</i> which may not be altered to correspond to actual damages determined after the fact.” <i>Heister</i>, 392 Md. at 156, 896 A.2d at 352 (emphasis added) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Because mitigation of damages is part of a post-breach calculation of actual damages, in the absence of a statute mandating mitigation of damages, there exists no duty to mitigate damages where a valid liquidated damages clause exists.</p>
<p id="03b2ff66-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 3 of the Agreement is a valid liquidated damages clause and not a penalty. Therefore, The Barrie School had no duty to mitigate damages and was entitled to the sum enumerated in §3 of the Agreement.</p>
<p id="03b2ff67-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, in addition to arguing the duty to mitigate, respondents claim the defense of no-actual-harm. Respondents contend that because The Barrie School filled their daughter’s space and actually enrolled more students than anticipated originally, the school suffered no harm from its breach of the Agreement. We reject this defense in this context. The same rationale we rely on in rejecting the duty to mitigate in the face of a valid liquidated damages provision applies to the no-actual-harm defense. Such a defense negates the benefit of an agreed-upon or stipulated damages clause and deviates from our acceptance of the principle that the time of contract formation is the appropriate point from which to judge the reasonableness of a stipulated amount of damages. It would also breed uncertainty in the calculation of damages, because if we were to accept the no-actual-harm defense, why would courts not then give greater damages than contemplated when the damages actually exceeded the stipulated amount?. . .</p>

<p id="03b2ff69-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We address respondents’ remaining contentions. Respondents argue that the Agreement was a contract of adhesion because it specified, in bold, capital letters that “ANY ALTERATIONS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED BY THE SCHOOL.” Respondents reason that because there was a gross inequity of bargaining power and The Barrie School imposed a liquidated damages provision in the Agreement, the provision was unenforceable. Both lower courts found that the Agreement was not a contract of adhesion. We agree with the lower courts.</p>
<p id="03b2ff6a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We note that a contract of adhesion is not void per se. <i>Walther v. Sovereign Bank</i>, 386 Md. 412, 430, 872 A.2d 735, 746 (2005). A court will find a contract of adhesion unenforceable only if it is unconscionable. Id. In the instant case, the Agreement was neither a contract of adhesion nor unconscionable. An unconscionable contract involves extreme unfairness, “made evident by (1) one party’s lack of meaningful choice, and (2) contractual terms that unreasonably favor the other party.” Id. at 426, 872 A.2d at 743 (internal citations and quotations omitted). Respondents were not forced to enroll their child at The Barrie School. Moreover, the “escape clause” was put into the Agreement for <span title="1078" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1078">p. 1078</span>the benefit of respondents. If respondents did not want to enroll their child at the school, all they needed to do was to notify school officials before May 31, 2004, and they would have incurred no financial liability. But for that provision respondents would have been bound to the Agreement without any opportunity for a refund. Respondents have not established that they had no choice but to enroll their child at The Barrie School, and the record does not suggest that the Agreement was anything but an arm’s-length business transaction. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court did not err in concluding that the Agreement was not a contract of adhesion. . . . </p>

I disagree. I am troubled by the result reached by the Majority, as it undermines basic principles of contract law pertaining to the equity and reasonableness of contract remedies.</p>

The vantage point from which that determination is made is critical to, and may be dispositive of, that inquiry. The Majority maintains that “the time of the contract formation is the appropriate point from which to judge the reasonableness of a liquidated damages provision.” Focusing exclusively on this “prospective view” leads the Majority to the conclusion it reaches.</p>
<p id="03b32681-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is another “view,” however. Because the validity of a liquidated damages does not become an issue until one of the parties breaches the contract to which it relates, it follows, logically, that the review of a liquidated damages clause to determine whether it is a penalty should include the effect of the breach, at the least, whether actual damages have been incurred. . . . </p>

<p id="03b32685-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The viability of a liquidated damages clause, thus, does not depend solely on the fixed amount for which the parties contracted; rather, all of the surrounding circumstances are important, those existing at the time of contracting, as well as those existing at the time of the breach, and they include consideration of the actual damages sustained. . . . This is, in my view, the only way in which to be completely fair to both parties.</p>
<p id="03b32686-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the case sub judice, there is no doubt that the Patches breached their Agreement with the School. On the other hand, the record indicates that the School did not suffer harm commensurate to the sum fixed as liquidated damages. While the Patches’ daughter did not attend the School, it is undisputed that the School met its enrollment projections for that year; there was “no empty desk” for which budgetary projections were made, yet not realized. Looking at the provision retrospectively, it is clear that the School should not be awarded a full year’s tuition, as this amount is grossly disproportionate to, and in excess of, the harm it actually suffered. . . . </p>

When, however, considered retrospectively, it is determined that the School’s recovery will be excessive, the liquidated damages clause that provides for that recovery is invalid and unenforceable. That simply means that the School will have to prove its actual damages as it would in any breach of contract action and will be required, moreover, to mitigate its damages, if the circumstances make that appropriate.</p>

The liquidation of damages and the mitigation of damages are, indeed, distinct and separate concepts, which must be treated as such, i.e., there is no exception to the general contractual duty to mitigate simply because a fixed sum has been agreed upon by the parties in advance.

<li class=""><p id="03b34da1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Test for enforcement of liquidated damages clauses</i>. Courts traditionally have used a three-pronged test to determine the validity of clauses providing for agreed remedies: (1) the damages to be anticipated from the breach must be uncertain in amount or difficult to prove; (2) the parties must have intended the clause to liquidate damages rather than operate as a penalty; and (3) the amount set in the agreement must be a reasonable forecast of just compensation for the harm flowing from the breach. See Orr v. Goodwin, 953 A.2d 1190 (N.H. 2008). Similarly, Restatement (Second) §356 states a two-part test: A provision for liquidated damages will be enforceable if the amount fixed is reasonable in light of the “anticipated or actual loss” and the “difficulties of proof of loss.” Comment <i>b</i> to §356 provides, “[t]he greater the difficulty either of proving that loss has occurred or of establishing its amount with the requisite <span title="1081" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1081">p. 1081</span>certainty . . . , the easier it is to show that the amount fixed is reasonable.” Thus, the difficulty in quantifying harm resulting from a breach is pivotal in many cases. See, e.g., Radisson Hotels Int’l, Inc. v. Majestic Towers, Inc., 488 F. Supp. 2d 953 (C.D. Cal. 2007) (liquidated damages clause in hotel licensing agreement enforceable in light of difficulty estimating future profitability of hotel at time contract was made); City of Davenport v. Shewry Corp., 674 N.W.2d 79 (Iowa 2004) (enforcing liquidated damages in economic development contract; it would be difficult, if not impossible, to measure harm resulting to plaintiff city from defendant company’s failure to create jobs that would contribute to city’s economy and tax base).</p>
<p id="03b34da2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many courts have also adopted the position expressed in <i>Barrie School</i> that a liquidated damage clause is presumed to be valid and the burden of proof is on the party seeking to invalidate the provision. This presumption is seen as a corollary of the “freedom of contract” principle. See, e.g., Carrothers Construction Co. v. City of S. Hutchinson, 207 P.3d 231 (Kan. 2009) (burden of proving that liquidated damage clause is unenforceable penalty falls on party challenging the provision; this approach promotes public policy favoring settlement, avoidance of litigation, and allowing parties to live by their own contracts); TAL Financial Corp. v. CSC Consulting, Inc., 844 N.E.2d 1085 (Mass. 2006) (majority of states place burden of proof on party seeking to avoid clause; doubts resolved in favor of enforcement).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03b34da3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Evaluating provision in light of anticipated or actual harm</i>. The majority and dissenting opinions in <i>Barrie School</i> disagree on a number of issues, including whether a liquidated damage clause should be judged <i>only</i> from the perspective of the parties at the time that the contract was made or <i>dually</i> from both the time of contracting and after the breach. Traditionally, courts used only the prospective view and many still adhere to this approach. For these courts, proof of a low amount of actual damage would have only limited relevance. See, e.g., Kelly v. Marx, 705 N.E.2d 1114 (Mass. 1999) (noting sharp division among jurisdictions on the issue but holding that stipulated remedy should be evaluated only in light of circumstances at time of contract formation; the expectations of parties and efficiency considerations support “single look” approach). The dissent in <i>Barrie School</i>, however, reflects the more recent trend toward assessing reasonableness either at the time of formation or after the breach. See, e.g., Wasserman’s Inc. v. Township of Middletown, 645 A.2d 100 (N.J. 1994) (adopting modern approach, noting “that hindsight is frequently better than foresight” and that a court cannot avoid being influenced by its knowledge of subsequent events).</p>
<p id="03b34da4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As noted above, the Restatement (Second) §356 states that a liquidated damage clause must be reasonable in light of the “anticipated or actual loss.” Also contributing to the current trend, UCC §2-718 provides that damages may be liquidated “only at an amount which is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual harm.” The impact of this two-fold perspective, however, is less than clear. In Wassenaar v. Panos, 331 N.W.2d 357 (Wis. 1983), the court stated that a clause producing liquidated damages “grossly disproportionate to <span title="1082" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1082">p. 1082</span>the actual harm” may thus be determined to be unreasonable. This approach suggests that a liquidated damages clause should be <i>denied</i> enforcement if it is unreasonable in light of the actual harm even if it appeared reasonable at contract formation. The Ninth Circuit court used a different approach in California &amp; Hawaiian Sugar Co. v. Sun Ship, Inc., 794 F.2d 1433 (9th Cir. 1986), <i>cert. denied</i>, 484 U.S. 871 (1987). In that case, the court interpreted the disjunctive language in the Restatement (Second) and the UCC to mean that a liquidated damage clause should be <i>upheld</i> if the clause was reasonable either in light of anticipated harm or in light of the actual harm. Thus, the Ninth Circuit court enforced a clause resulting in recovery of more than $4 million because it was a reasonable forecast of what might have happened, even though the actual harm was apparently less than $400,000. The Ninth Circuit court also emphasized that the parties to the contract were sophisticated and that the precise extent of actual harm was difficult to measure. Id. at 1439. See also XCO International, Inc. v. Pacific Scientific Co., 369 F.3d 998 (7th Cir. 2004) (rule against penalty clauses is “anachronism,” especially in contracts between commercial enterprises; clause will be enforceable if reasonable in light of actual harm even if not reasonable forecast at time contract was made).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03b34da5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Necessity of actual loss</i>. The defendant parents in <i>Barrie School</i> argued that the plaintiff suffered no actual harm from their daughter’s failure to attend the school. If it did appear that there had been no injury at all, should the liquidated damages clause have been enforced? Under the traditional approach of assessing enforceability solely at the time of contracting, as noted above, even a total absence of loss might well be irrelevant. See, e.g., Frick Co. v. Rubel Corp., 62 F.2d 765 (2d Cir. 1933) (actual harm not relevant); Wallace Real Estate Investment, Inc. v. Groves, 881 P.2d 1010 (Wash. 1994) (actual damage not prerequisite to upholding liquidated damages clause, but unconscionably disproportionate actual damage may be used in evaluating reasonableness of pre-estimate). A number of courts have held, however, that the complete absence of actual loss or injury will make a clause invalid as a penalty. See, e.g., Colonial at Lynnfield, Inc. v. Sloan, 870 F.2d 761 (1st Cir. 1989); Valentine’s, Inc. v. Ngo, 251 S.W.3d 352 (Mo. Ct. App. 2008).</p></li>

Carborundum Co., 769 F.2d 1284 (7th Cir. 1985). <i>Lake River</i> involved a contract for distribution services between two commercial entities and the court held that any savings from mitigation should not be deducted from recovery under a liquidated damages clause. As noted by the <i>Barrie School</i> majority, Judge Posner asserted that mitigation is inconsistent with the underlying premise that such clauses allow parties to fix the amount of damages with certainty. The rule that there is no duty to mitigate in the face of a valid liquidated damages clause appears to be the consensus view. See NPS, LLC v. Minihane, 886 N.E.2d 670 (Mass. 2008). On the other hand, the dissenting judge in <i>Barrie School</i> would have imposed a duty to mitigate and at least a few other courts seem to agree. See Southern Bldg. Services, Inc. v. City of Ft. Smith, 427 S.W.3d 763 (Ark. Ct. App. 2013) <span title="1083" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1083">p. 1083</span>(affirming denial of liquidated damages when plaintiff failed to mitigate after breach); Howard Sales Co., Inc. v. Bradley, 2008 WL 2930197 (Neb. Ct. App.) (noting that if circumstances of a contract and its breach lend themselves to mitigation, it is difficult to sustain a liquidated damages clause). See also Lisa A. Fortin, Why There Should Be a Duty to Mitigate Liquidated Damages Clauses, 38 Hofstra L. Rev. 285 (2009) (advocating for duty to mitigate despite liquidated damages clause to promote efficiency and good faith behavior, to avoid penalties and double recovery, and on other grounds).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03b374b7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Liquidated damages in consumer contracts</i>. The majority opinion in <i>Barrie School</i> recognized in footnote 5 that a specific state statute regulates liquidated damages clauses in “layaway” sales. Similarly, statutory provisions in California create special rules limiting enforceability of liquidated damages clauses in consumer contracts involving goods or services obtained for personal, family, or household purposes and in residential leases. See Cal. Civ. Code §1671. The contract in the <i>Barrie School</i> case would be considered a “consumer” contract rather than a commercial contract. Should that fact have affected the willingness of the court to enforce the liquidated damages clause? See L &amp; L Wings, Inc. v. Marco-Destin, Inc., 756 F. Supp. 2d 359 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (in evaluating liquidated damages provision, court must consider whether parties were sophisticated, represented by counsel, negotiated at “arms-length” or had equal bargaining power).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03b374b8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Liquidated damages in construction contracts</i>. Clauses providing for liquidated damages in the event of delay in completion are common in construction and similar contracts; such clauses typically measure the amount recoverable by some daily or weekly rate, with perhaps an outside time limit, and are usually held to be enforceable in light of the various kinds of injury — both tangible and intangible — that can result from such delays. See, e.g., Hutton Contracting Company, Inc. v. City of Coffeyville, 487 F.3d 772 (10th. Cir. 2007) (applying Kansas law in enforcing $500 per day delay damages in construction of new power and fiber optic lines); American Multi-Cinema, Inc. v. Southroads, L.L.C., 119 F. Supp. 2d 1190 (D. Kan. 2000) (enforcing portion of liquidated damage clause that allowed four days of free rent for each day that shopping center was late in turning over site for construction of movie “mega-plex” by tenant); but see Rohlin Construction Co. v. City of Hinton, 476 N.W.2d 78 (Iowa 1991) (provision in highway contract for $400 daily liquidated damages for delay held to be unenforceable penalty; while slight damage might have occurred, amount in contract bore no reasonable relation to anticipated or actual loss). In Cuesport Properties, LLC v. Critical Developments, LLC, 61 A.3d 91 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2013), a liquidated damages clause provided for per diem payments when the builder was late in completing construction. Rejecting the defendant builder’s argument that the clause created a penalty because payments could continue indefinitely if the builder abandoned the project, the appellate court held that in such a case the builder’s liability need be continued only for whatever time period would be necessary for the owner or another builder to complete the work. The court recognized the <i>Barrie</i> holding that generally mitigation would not be required where the parties had liquidated <span title="1084" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1084">p. 1084</span>damages in their agreement, but distinguished that case on its facts. Compare Dollar Tree Stores Inc. v. Toyama Partners LLC, 875 F. Supp. 2d 1058 (N.D. Cal. 2012), where the court disallowed as a penalty a clause providing a fixed sum per diem for delay in performance, because the payment rate was the same no matter how severe or minor the breach, and because the payments could continue indefinitely.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03b374b9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Liquidated damages in employment contracts</i>. In the preceding section of this chapter we saw that courts will not grant specific performance of personal service contracts and are even reluctant to provide injunctive relief. Because of this judicial tendency, employment contracts may contain liquidated damage clauses that apply in the event of breach by the employee. See, e.g., Vanderbilt v. DiNardo, 174 F.3d 751 (6th Cir. 1999) (liquidated damage clause requiring college football head coach to pay sum equal to net annual salary for breach was enforceable; amount was reasonable in light of tangible and intangible harm resulting from discontinuity in football program if coach did not complete five-year term). Of course, such clauses must still survive judicial determination of whether they operate as a penalty. See Equity Enterprises, Inc. v. Milosch, 633 N.W.2d 662 (Wis. Ct. App. 2001) (forfeiture of sales commissions by former insurance agent for breach of covenant not to compete was not a reasonable liquidated damage provision).</p>
<p id="03b374ba-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Employment contracts may also include a liquidated damage clause that provides a remedy for the employee in the event of breach by the employer. In <i>Wassenaar</i>, cited in Note 2 above, the plaintiff entered into a three-year employment contract, agreeing to serve as the general manager of the defendant’s hotel. If the defendant terminated the contract prior to its expiration, defendant agreed to be “responsible for fulfilling the entire financial obligation as set forth within this agreement for the full period of three (3) years.” The employer discharged the plaintiff 21 months before the expiration of the contract. The plaintiff was unemployed for approximately two and one-half months, but then obtained a job, which he held until the time of trial. The Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the employee was entitled to his full compensation for the remainder of the three-year term as liquidated damages with no deduction for the pay he received from the other job. The court reasoned that the standard measure of damages for the employer’s breach of an employment contract (the contract amount plus expenses of seeking other employment less earnings received from other employment) does not compensate for certain consequential damages, such as harm to reputation and emotional stress; accordingly, the clause could be upheld as a reasonable forecast of uncertain damages.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03b374bb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Liquidated damages in real estate contracts and specific performance</i>. Real estate contracts typically require purchasers to make “earnest money” deposits and often provide for retention of the deposit by the seller if the purchaser breaches. Courts are divided on how to treat such provisions. Many courts will not allow a breaching purchaser to recover any portion of an earnest money deposit. See Star Financial Corp. v. Howard Nance Co., 508 S.E.2d 534 (N.C. Ct. App. 1998), <i>aff’d</i>, 516 S.E.2d 381 (1999) (North Carolina adheres to common law rule, followed by majority of jurisdictions, that breaching purchaser <span title="1085" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1085">p. 1085</span>cannot recover any portion of consideration paid). Other courts treat such provisions as liquidated damage clauses subject to judicial scrutiny under the tests discussed above. See, e.g., Palmieri v. Partridge, 853 A.2d 1076 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2004) (clause requiring forfeiture of $225,000 deposit on purchase price of $2,250,000 was a reasonable liquidated damage provision and not a penalty; forfeitures of up to 10 percent have often been found to be reasonable).</p>
<p id="03b374bc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Should the presence of a liquidated damage clause bar the granting of specific performance of a real estate contract? The courts have been divided on this question. Compare Allen v. Smith, 114 Cal. Rptr. 2d 898 (Ct. App. 2002) (liquidated damage clause will not bar action for specific performance in real estate contract), with O’Shield v. Lakeside Bank, 781 N.E.2d 1114 (Ill. App. Ct. 2002) (liquidated damage clause does preclude action for specific performance in real estate contract, based on clear intent of parties). Professor Murray concluded that if specific performance or injunctive relief would otherwise be available, a liquidated damages clause will not bar such relief unless it is expressly excluded. John E. Murray, Jr., Murray on Contracts §126, at 800-801 (5th ed. 2011). Professor Murray further noted that courts will not allow the nonbreaching party to receive both liquidated damages and specific performance if the result would be overcompensation. Id.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03b374bd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Underliquidated damages</i>. Most often, liquidated damage clauses are scrutinized in light of the possibility that they might greatly overcompensate the plaintiff for defendant’s breach. The majority and dissenting opinions in <i>Barrie School</i>, relying on earlier precedent, clearly contemplate that a liquidated damages clause will not be rendered unenforceable merely because the actual damages greatly exceed the stipulated remedy. You should note, however, that Restatement (Second) §356, Comment <i>a</i>, suggests that a term fixing an “unreasonably small amount” of damages might be unenforceable because it is “unconscionable.” UCC §2-718(1) and its Comment 1 are to the same effect as the Restatement on this point. Still, there is the possibility that a clause providing for a small amount of damages may reflect a rational agreement to limit liability in the event of breach. See Rainbow Country Rentals &amp; Retails, Inc. v. Ameritech Publishing, Inc., 706 N.W.2d 95 (Wis. 2005) (agreeing with majority of jurisdictions that clause limiting liability for error in telephone directory is enforceable stipulated remedy in light of difficulty in assessing actual harm).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03b374be-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Scholarly commentary</i>. A considerable body of scholarly writing has debated the wisdom of the “penalty” limitation on the enforceability of liquidated damage clauses. See, e.g., Charles J. Goetz &amp; Robert E. Scott, Liquidated Damages, Penalties and the Just Compensation Principle: Some Notes on an Enforcement Model and a Theory of Efficient Breach, 77 Colum. L. Rev. 554 (1977) (penalty limitation on liquidated damage clauses should be abolished; such clauses should be enforced unless they are the product of some defect in the bargaining process); Kenneth W. Clarkson, Roger LeRoy Miller, &amp; Timothy J. Muris, Liquidated Damages v. Penalties: Sense or Nonsense?, 1978 Wis. L. Rev. 351 (under economic analysis penalty limitation should be applied to situations where there may be opportunity and incentive to induce breach; in other cases clause should be upheld without regard to whether it is <span title="1086" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1086">p. 1086</span>penalty); Larry A.

<p id="03b39bda-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Edith Evans owns and operates a private elementary school (the “Evans School”) with approximately 200 students. In June 2017 Bryn Barnes enrolled her son, Kyle, in the Evans School and signed a contract agreeing to pay full tuition of $42,000 for the academic year. Tuition was payable in two equal installments, due in July and September. The written contract included a provision which read, “All tuition payments are nonrefundable and will be forfeited upon withdrawal from the Evans School for any reason whatsoever.” The contract also had a clause stating, “This written contract contains the complete agreement of the parties.”</p>
<p id="03b39bdb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In October 2017 the school sent a questionnaire form to all parents, including Bryn, inquiring if they had any skills they would be willing to perform for the school as a volunteer to help reduce school expenses. Bryn returned the form to the school, stating, “I build and design websites for a living.” At the time, the Evans School had a very basic website.</p>
<p id="03b39bdc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After receiving Bryn’s response, Edith asked Bryn to update the appearance of and make some new “posts” on the school’s website. Bryn agreed and from November 2017 to May 2018, she spent about ten hours each month doing information technology (IT) work for the school. Bryn did not receive any monetary compensation for this work. In June 2018, Bryn re-enrolled Kyle for the 2018–2019 academic year, again signing a contract to pay yearly tuition of $42,000 in two installments. Bryn paid $21,000 at that time.</p>
<p id="03b39bdd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In August 2018 Edith told Bryn the school was planning to upgrade its IT systems in anticipation of an upcoming inspection by an accreditation committee and she wished to discuss how Bryn could help in that process. On August 21, Edith and Bryn met to discuss Bryn’s possible role in improving the school’s IT system. They discussed Bryn’s educational background, work history, and qualifications. Edith told Bryn she wanted to improve the school’s network and wireless system to allow use of iPads. Edith added that she wanted more interaction and communication with the parents through the school’s website, and she wanted an upgraded electronic newsletter.</p>
<p id="03b39bde-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During the meeting, Edith said to Bryn, “This is a lot of work, and obviously, I wouldn’t ask you to do this without some sort of arrangement of compensation.” Edith told Bryn that with some other parents who perform services for the school, “we work out a tuition reimbursement.” Edith explained she compensated other parents this way “for tax purposes.” Bryn said that the value of her time to do all the tasks Edith had described would clearly exceed one year’s tuition of $42,000, but Bryn also said that she was so happy <span title="1088" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1088">p. 1088</span>with the school for her son that she would do the work for a tuition abatement of that amount, plus any expenses Bryn incurred. At Edith’s request, Bryn sent her an e-mail the next day, outlining the services Bryn intended to perform. Bryn divided the work into three areas: website, network, and iPad rollout. Bryn described the work in each area in substantial detail. The email also stated, “The refund of Kyle’s tuition for the year will be appreciated.” Edith replied by e-mail, stating, “Terrific. A tall order, but let’s go forward with this plan.”</p>
<p id="03b39bdf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From September 2018 to the end of the academic year in June 2019, Bryn performed all the work described in her August 2018 e-mail. Bryn was also “the on-call IT person,” receiving and responding to requests from students, parents, faculty, and staff about how to use certain computer applications and e-mail systems. She upgraded the school’s newsletter and trained students to use the new applications. In materials submitted to the accreditation agency, the school referred to Bryn as its “Director of Information Technology.” In the meantime, Bryn paid the 2018-2019 tuition balance of $21,000 for Kyle in September 2018 when billed. Bryn heard nothing from Edith about the tuition refund.</p>
<p id="03b39be0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On July 1, 2019, Bryn went to the Evans School to sign the enrollment contract for Kyle for the 2019-2020 academic year. Before signing, Bryn told the school’s financial manager that she was owed a rebate of the prior year’s tuition and thus Bryn thought she should not need to pay for the coming year. The financial manager said he had not been informed about any tuition refund for Bryn and that he would speak with Edith about the tuition question.</p>
<p id="03b39be1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On July 15, 2019, Bryn received a letter from the school’s attorney, taking the position that the school did not agree to trade a tuition refund for Bryn’s work. Responding, Bryn prepared an invoice, showing time spent and tasks performed under the August 2018 agreement pursuant to the email exchange with Edith. Bryn prepared the invoice by reviewing her e-mails, computer “log-ins,” and other records to create an hourly spreadsheet showing the work she performed. The invoice totaled 1,247 hours, which Bryn said represented “everything that I did for the school over a 10-month period.” Bryn billed her time at $100 per hour, the rate she charged in her business, and added $5,336 in costs she had advanced for travel, six iPads and other material, and certain internet fees.</p>
<p id="03b39be2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The school refused to pay any part of Bryn’s $130,036 invoice. When Bryn concluded the school was not going to honor the agreement, she enrolled Kyle in a different school for the 2019-2020 school year.</p>
<p id="03b39be3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Bryn has now come to your law office and tells you all of the foregoing information. Bryn explains that she wants to bring suit against the Evans School for breach of August 2018 agreement and any related claims. Bryn also states that she wishes to claim payment for the work she did during Kyle’s first year (2017-2018) at the Evans School. Bryn wants to know if she would be likely to succeed in a lawsuit and what remedies, if any, she might be able to recover. What is your assessment?</p>

Beginning in 2001, she was a salaried employee of Eezy Freezy, Inc. (EF), a manufacturer of refrigeration equipment for large commercial uses. CC had no written contract with EF, and worked on an at-will basis. Her salary steadily increased over time; by 2018 she was being paid by EF at an annual rate of $120,000. In late 2018, CC was offered a job by Absolute Zero, Inc. (AZ), a maker of household refrigerators and freezers, selling appliances in bulk to residential developers and large retail dealers. The offer was for a three-year full-time employment contract, with her compensation to be in the form of a 5% commission on all sales made by her annually up to $3,000,000. She would receive a $10,000 monthly advance against commissions to be earned. CC was assured that based on past experience of AZ sales agents she could easily make up to $3 million in annual sales, and also that if she was successful in making sales she would be considered for a stock bonus after one year. CC accepted the offer from AZ, and began working on Jan. 1, 2019, pursuant to a written contract signed by both parties. By the end of April, serious differences had developed between CC and AZ’s vice-president in charge of sales. At the end of June 2019, CC had made sales of only $450,000 for AZ, and she was notified by AZ that her employment was being terminated for cause: insufficient productivity and refusal to follow established AZ procedures.</p>

On March 15, Bonnie made an oral agreement with Sara Smith, a local contractor, to build two customized “smokehouse sheds” on property in the rear of her restaurant. Bonnie already had plans for the two smokehouses of 10 feet by 20 feet with related equipment and storage bins. Bonnie and Sara agreed upon a price of $50,000 per smokehouse with 50% due at the beginning of construction of each smokehouse and the balance due upon completion of each unit. They agreed that Sara would complete the first unit before starting the second. The first smokehouse was to be completed by May 1 and the second smokehouse was to be completed by July 1. Sara started work on the first smokehouse on April 1 and Bonnie paid her $25,000 that week. Sara completed the first smokehouse on April 30 and gave an invoice to Bonnie for the $25,000 due upon completion. Before making that payment, Bonnie asked Sara when she would start the second smokehouse. Sara told Bonnie, “I just got a big cabinetry subcontract on an office building and I am not going to have time to build your second smokehouse. You need to get someone else.” Bonnie then said, “I won’t pay you another dime until you keep the contract to build the second smokehouse.” After three months, Bonnie heard no more from Sara and got bids on the second smokehouse from two contractors who both quoted a price of $55,000. Bonnie comes to your law office and wants to know if she might be liable to Sara if Sara should bring suit for payment of the balance of $25,000 on the first smokehouse. Which of the following outcomes is most likely?</p>

Recently GD’s staff competed a study showing that because of population growth in that area over the last five years, a new pharmacy on the west side of Smalltown would be a good investment, yielding profits at least at the average level for Gateway stores in that region of the country. GD’s real estate agents identified in that area a three-acre lot of appropriate size and location for its proposed new store. The lot was owned by Rachel Robinson (RR), an elderly widow. RR had lived in a small house on that lot for over 25 years, but during that time the character of the neighborhood had changed from rural/residential to residential/commercial. After the death of her husband two years ago, RR began to feel the burden (financial and practical) of maintaining the house on her own, and finally decided to sell the property and move to live with her daughter in Capital City, some 200 miles to the east. After some negotiation, RR and GD’s agents agreed that GD would buy RR’s property for $455,000, the closing to be held within 60 days after the parties’ signing of the agreement, at a time and place to be mutually agreed upon. The contract provided for a down payment of $25,000 by GD, with the balance to be paid at the closing. The agreement also provided that in the event the sale did not take place, RR would be entitled to retain the down payment as liquidated damages. GD’s intention, of which RR was aware, was to demolish the house and erect on the lot a building suitable for a full-size retail pharmacy.</p>

Beginning in December 1988, Titan paid royalties to all wrestlers appearing in videotapes of pay-per-view events.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="03b215a7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10A4E_2c3aca9b-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" id="note-N10A4E_2c3aca9b-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">1</a></span>&nbsp;Immediately following <i>Anderson</i>, the California Legislature modified §3423 to allow for the use of injunctive relief to enforce a negative covenant where the promised service is of a unique character the loss of which cannot be adequately compensated in damages. In its current form, the statute states, “[a]n injunction may not be granted . . . to prevent the breach of a contract the performance of which would not be specifically enforced . . . other than a contract in writing for the rendition of personal services . . . where the promised service is of a special, unique, [or] unusual . . . character, which gives it peculiar value. . . .” Construing this new version of the statute in Motown Record Corp. v. Brockert (1984), 160 Cal. App. 3d 123, 138, 207 Cal. Rptr. 574, 584, the California Court of Appeals stated that for reasons of public policy, a negative covenant (an exclusivity clause in that case), can be enforced by injunction when the contract is with a performer of requisite distinction as measured by the compensation the employer is willing to pay. Although <i>Motown</i> establishes the appropriate application of §3423 in its current form, that case is of no consequence here given that §27-19-103(5), MCA, is identical to the earlier version of §3423.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="03b28a09-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10BB1_2c3aca9b-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" id="note-N10BB1_2c3aca9b-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">1</a></span>&nbsp;Based on the record from the District Court proceedings, it appears that respondents abandoned this final claim.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="03b2d846-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10C52_2c3aca9b-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" id="note-N10C52_2c3aca9b-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">5</a></span>&nbsp;For statutory provisions providing otherwise, see, for example, the Uniform Commercial Code §2-718(1) and the corresponding Maryland provision applying to the sale of goods, Md.

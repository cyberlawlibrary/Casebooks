<p id="031e60c5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this chapter, we will address the process which traditionally has been employed to create binding legal contractual obligations: The manifestation of two (or more) parties’ mutual assent to an exchange of performances, supported by consideration. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) §17: Formation of a contract requires “a bargain in which there is a manifestation of mutual assent to the exchange and a consideration.” Part A-1 of this chapter considers the extent to which the parties must actually intend their agreement to have legally binding effect. Part A-2 looks at some examples of the agreement-making process at work. Part B examines the element of “consideration,” traditionally a requisite for the creation of a binding contractual obligation. Part C looks at the impact that the Uniform Commercial Code has had on the law of contract formation, beginning in the mid-twentieth century, and also notes the effect of international commercial law. Part D confronts the possibility that present-day technological innovation is currently in the process of transforming the rules of contract formation in fundamental ways.</p>
</div>
<div id="031e60c6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" level="A" class="epub-section epub-ahead cc-section"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-xlarge left"><h2><p class="cc-wrapper" id="031e60c7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56">A.&nbsp;MUTUAL ASSENT</p></h2></div>


<p id="031e60c8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Several points about the Restatement’s requirements for formation of a contract should be noted at this point. First, the Restatement refers to the concept of a “bargain,” to which the parties express their “mutual assent.” Under the traditional model of contract formation, parties engage in the give-and-take of bargaining through a process of offer and acceptance, ultimately either reaching a deal or breaking off negotiations. It is important to recognize, however, that a contract can be formed even when the parties do not engage in a bargaining process. Noncommercial transactions involving family members, friends, or charitable entities may in some cases result in contracts even though the <span title="36" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-36">p. 36</span>parties have not engaged in a formal negotiation. We will consider a number of such noncommercial transactions in this chapter.</p>
<p id="031e87d9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even within the commercial realm, contracts can arise despite the absence of back-and-forth bargaining between the parties. Consider, for example, the many contracts that you have entered into over the Internet, in which you checked a box stating “I agree” to various terms that you have scrolled through, probably without reading and almost certainly without bargaining. (We will see later in this chapter that substantial controversy exists over how the law should treat such “contracts.” One of the principal reasons for this controversy is that these contracts typically involve some form of inequality of bargaining power between the parties.) An important thing to recognize at this stage of your studies is that a bargain resulting in mutual assent is the traditional and probably most important way in which a contract can be formed, but it is definitely not the <i>only</i> way.</p>
<p id="031e87da-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, it is also possible that one person can incur legal obligations to another even though they have not entered into a consideration-supported contract. The doctrines of <i>restitution</i> and <i>promissory estoppel</i> involve possible liability between parties even though no contract in the traditional sense has been formed or even contemplated. We will examine these concepts in Chapter 3, and consider the policy reasons why contract law has come to recognize those additional bases of obligation.</p>
<p id="031e87db-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, even if a contract has been formed, that is far from the end of the analysis. As we will see in later chapters, a party who has entered into a contract may be relieved of that obligation if the other party has engaged in some form of bargaining misconduct, such as fraud or duress (to name just some of the possibilities), or if circumstances that existed at the time of the contract have changed sufficiently to justify nonperformance.</p>
<div id="031e87dc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="031e87dd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56">1.&nbsp;Intention to be Bound: The Objective Theory of Contract</p></h3></div>

<p id="031e87de-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In applying the concept of mutual assent, many courts have stated that the formation of a contract requires a “meeting of the minds” between the parties. A subtle but important distinction exists, however, between the ideas of “mutual assent” and “meeting of the minds.” Suppose S and B sign a written document which states that B agrees to buy a condominium in a new development that S is building. B later claims she did not understand that she was signing a contract — she had not yet decided to buy the condo, and thought that the document she signed simply “reserved” the condo for her without obligating her to buy it. S sues B for breach of contract, and the case goes to a trial before a jury. Suppose the jury believes that B is telling the truth and that she honestly did not understand that the document she signed obligated her to buy the property, but the jury also finds that S did honestly (and reasonably) think B was committing herself to the purchase. If contract law truly requires a “meeting of the minds” for contract formation, then the jury should decide for B. This view of contract formation has been described as “subjective” in that the actual intention of a party, rather than that party’s conduct, determines <span title="37" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-37">p. 37</span>the party’s legal obligations. On the other hand, if contract law requires only a “manifestation of mutual assent,” then (absent some fraud or other misconduct by S) the jury should decide for S, because both S and B did manifest their apparent assent by signing the contract of sale. The latter approach has been described as “objective,” in that it looks at the conduct of the parties from the perspective of a hypothetical “reasonable person” rather than attempting to examine their actual, subjective intentions. Which approach should contract law use? Consider the following case.</p>

<p id="031eaef5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In an action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County by the owners of an unimproved lot against a construction company for a complete breach of a written contract to build a house, the court, sitting without a jury, found for the defendant and the plaintiffs appealed.</p>
<p id="031eaef6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Calvin T. Ray and Katherine S. J. Ray, his wife, own a lot on Dance Mill Road in Baltimore County. Late in 1950, they decided to build a home on it, and entered into negotiations with several builders, including William G. Eurice &amp; Bros., Inc., the appellee, which had been recommended by friends. They submitted stock plans and asked for an estimate — not a bid — to see whether the contemplated house was within their financial resources. John M. Eurice, its President, acted for the Eurice Corporation. He indicated at the first meeting that the cost of the house would be about $16,000. Mr. Ray then employed an architect who redrew the plans and wrote a rough draft of specifications. Mr. Ray had copies of each mechanically reproduced, and in January, 1951, arranged a meeting with Mr. Eurice to go over them so that a final bid, as opposed to an estimate, could be arrived at. In the Ray living room, Mr. Ray and Mr. John Eurice went over the redrawn plans dated January 9, 1951, and the specifications prepared by the architect, consisting of seven pages and headed “Memorandum Specifications, Residence for Mr. and Mrs. C. T. Ray, Dance Mill Road, Baltimore County, Maryland, 9 January, 1951,” and discussed each item. Mr. Eurice vetoed some items and suggested change in others. For example, foundation walls were specified to be of concrete block. Mr. Eurice wanted to pour concrete walls, as was his custom. Framing lumber was to be fir. Mr. Eurice wanted this to be fir or pine. In some instances, Mr. Eurice, wanting more latitude, asked that the phrase “or equivalent” be added after a specified product or brand make. All the changes agreed on were noted by Mr. Ray in green ink on the January 9th specifications, and Mr. Eurice was given a set of plans and a set of the specifications so that he could make a formal bid in writing. On February 14, the Eurice Corporation submitted unsigned, its typewritten three-page proposed contract to build a house for $16,300 “according to the following specifications.” Most of the three pages consisted of specifications which did not agree in many, although often relatively unimportant, respects <span title="38" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-38">p. 38</span>with those in the January 9th seven-page specifications. Mr. Ray advised Mr. Eurice that he would have his own lawyer draw the contract. This was done. In the contract, as prepared and as finally signed, the builder agrees to construct a house for $16,300 “strictly in accordance with the Plans hereto attached and designated residence for Mr. and Mrs. C. T. Ray, Dance Mill Road, Baltimore County, Maryland, Sheets 1 through 7 dated 9 January 1951  . . . and to supply and use only those materials and building supplies shown on the Specifications hereto attached and designated Memorandum Specifications — Residence for Mr. C. T. Ray, Dance Mill Road, Baltimore County, Maryland, Sheets 1 through 5 dated 14 February 1951 it being understood and agreed that any deviation from the said Plans shall be made only with the prior assent of the Owner. Deviations from the Specifications shall be made only in the event any of the items shown thereon is unavailable at the time its use is required, and then only after reasonable effort and diligence on the part of the Builder to obtain the specific item has failed and the owner has given his prior approval to the use of a substitute item.”</p>
<p id="031eaef7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Memorandum Specifications referred to in the contract, consisting of five pages and dated February 14, 1951, had been prepared by Mr. and Mrs. Ray, the night of the day the Eurice Corporation delivered its three-page proposal, and after Mr. Ray had said that his own lawyer would draw the contract. On the 14th of February the January 9 seven pages, as they had emerged from the green ink deletions and additions made at the meeting in January, were retyped and from the stencil so cut at the Ray apartment, Mr. Ray had many copies mechanically reproduced at the Martin Plant where he is an aeronautical engineer. The rewritten specifications were identified as they are designated in the contract, namely as “ . . . Sheets 1 through 5, dated 14 February 1951.”</p>
<p id="031eaef8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On February 22, at the office of the Eurice Corporation, on the Old Philadelphia Road, the contract was signed. Present, at the time, were Mr. Ray — Mrs. Ray was absent and had signed the contract earlier because she could not get a babysitter — Mr. John Eurice and Mr. Henry Eurice, who is Secretary of the Eurice Corporation. Mr. Ray relates the details of the meeting, as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="031eaef9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I had copies, plans and specifications before me, as well as two copies of the contract. We sat down, Mr. John Eurice and I sat down and went over all of the items in the specifications. I volunteered to show him I had in fact changed the specifications to reflect their building idiosyncrasies, such as wanting to build the house with a poured cellar. We also went over the contract document item by item. Following that, we each signed the contract and Mr. Henry Eurice, being the other party there at the time, witnessed our signature. He was in the room during the entire discussion or review of the contract.</p>
</div>
<p id="031ed60a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After the contract had been signed, Mr. Ray says he asked that the Eurice brothers help him fill out the F.H.A. form of specifications (required to obtain the mortgage he needed) since he was not familiar with the intricacies of that form. This they did, with Mr. Henry Eurice giving most of the aid. They used the <span title="39" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-39">p. 39</span>memorandum specifications of February 14 where they corresponded with the F.H.A. form and in other instances, as where the memorandum specifications were not adequate, Mr. Henry Eurice gave the necessary information. After the F.H.A. specifications were completed, the meeting broke up and a copy of the signed contract and copies of the Plans and Specifications were retained by the Eurice Corporation.</p>
<p id="031ed60b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Ray then obtained a loan from the Loyola Savings &amp; Loan Association. To do this it was necessary that he furnish it with his copy of the contract as well as copies of the Plans, the specifications of February 14 and the F.H.A. specifications. Neither the plans nor specifications which were left with the Building Association were signed by the Eurice Corporation, nor, through a misunderstanding, had they been signed by either Mr. or Mrs. Ray. When they applied for the loan, Mr. and Mrs. Ray did sign the reverse side of each page of the drawings and of the contract specifications. Thereafter, in response to a call from the Building Association, Mr. John Eurice went to its office and signed the reverse side of each page of the contract, each page of the specifications of the five-page specifications of February 14, referred to in the contract, and each page of the plans dated January 9, and referred to in the contract, although he says that he did not look at any of these prior to signing them.</p>
<p id="031ed60c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Settlement of the mortgage loan was made on April 19 and thereafter, Mr. Ray phoned Mr. John Eurice repeatedly in order to set a starting date for the construction work. He finally came to the Ray home on April 22 and indicated that he would start construction sometime about the middle of May. Other details of the work were discussed and Mr. Ray was given the names of a plumber and a supply company so that he could pick out and buy direct various products which would be incorporated in the house. Mr. Eurice, at that time, brought up the question of a dry well which had not been noted in the specifications, and which was required by the Baltimore County Building Code, and Mr. Ray agreed that he would make allowance for this, as he felt it was an honest mistake.</p>
<p id="031ed60d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On May 8, Mr. Ray received urgent messages from the Eurice Corporation that his presence was desired for a conference. As he walked into the office, Mr. Henry Eurice picked up the drawings, specifications and the contract, and threw them across the desk at him, and onto the floor, with the announcement that he had never seen them, and that if he had to build according to those specifications he did not propose to go ahead. Attempts were made at the meeting to iron out the differences which apparently caused Mr. Henry Eurice to state that he would not live up to the contract. A second meeting was held at the Ray apartment several days later, and these efforts were continued by Mr. John Eurice, and that was the last contact that the Ray family had with any officer or agent of the Eurice Corporation. Realization that to build according to contract specifications would cost more than their usual “easy going, hatchet and saw manner” as Judge Gontrum described it, undoubtedly played a part in the refusal of the Eurice brothers to build the Ray house, although they testified that the excess cost would be only about $1,000. More decisive, in all probability, was Mr. Ray’s precision and his insistence on absolute accuracy in the smallest details which certainly made the Eurices unhappy, and to them was the <span title="40" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-40">p. 40</span>shadow cast by harassing and expensive events to come. For example, at the meeting where the specifications were thrown across the desk, Mr. Ray agreed that certain millwork and trim which the Eurices had on hand was the equal of the specified Morgan millwork. Mr. Henry Eurice testified as to this:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="031ed60e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">He said that he thought ours were better. I said “if we put that in your house how will we determine it was right or not?” He said he would bring a camera and take a picture of the moldings in our shed and when they were constructed in the house take another picture, and see if it would correspond. I said, “Man we can’t build you a house under those conditions. It is not reasonable.” It created a heated argument for a while.</p>
</div>
<p id="031ed60f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After written notice by Mr. Ray’s lawyer to the lawyer for Eurice Corporation, that Mr. and Mrs. Ray considered that the contract had been breached and unless recognized within the week they would hold the Eurice Corporation “for any additional amount necessary to construct the house over and above the price called for in the agreement which has been breached by your client” had been ignored, suit was filed.</p>
<p id="031ed610-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. John Eurice agrees, in his testimony, that the Memorandum Sheets 1 to 7, dated January 9, had been gone over by him with Mr. and Mrs. Ray, but only as he says, to pick up “pointers.” He also agrees that he had been told that the contract was to be drawn by Mr. Ray’s lawyer, but says that he agreed only “so long as it is drawn up to our three page contract.” He says that no specifications were attached to the contract which was signed, at the time it was signed, and Mr. and Mrs. Ray cannot say definitely that the specifications were physically attached, although both say that they were unquestionably in existence and Mr. Ray is unequivocal and positive in his statement that they were present, stapled together, and discussed at the time of signing the contract. Mr. John Eurice says that the first time he saw the specifications was when his brother Henry “chucked them out,” and in response to a question as to where they came from, said: “They were laying on the desk on the opened mail.” This, he says, was some two weeks after the signing of the contract. No effort has been made by the appellee to show how the specifications arrived in the office at this time, with the opened mail. No envelope, with what could be a significant postmark, was introduced. No stenographer or clerk was brought into court to say that the specifications had been received in the mail, or to say that they had been delivered by messenger, or by Mr. Ray. Mr. John Eurice does not deny that he signed the plans and specifications, as well as the back of the contract at the office of the Loyola Building and Loan Association, but dismisses this as a practice necessary in all cases where financing is to be obtained, which has no relation to or significance in connection with the actual agreement between builder and owner.</p>
<p id="031ed611-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Henry Eurice says that, although he was present at the time the contract was signed, and signed as a witness, that no specifications were attached to either copy of the signed contract, and that he did not see Specifications 1 to 5 until “right smart later, maybe a month.” When he did first see them “they were laying on the desk on the opened mail.”</p>
<p id="031efd22-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="41" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-41">p. 41</span>Mr. John Eurice says in his testimony that the contract which was signed February 22 was not the proposal the Eurice Corporation had made. He sets forth that he read the contract of February 22 before he signed it, and he admits that he read paragraph B, whereby the builder agreed to construct the building strictly in accordance with the plans and specifications identified by description and date. He says he thought that the specifications, although they referred to pages 1 through 5, were those in his proposal which covered only three pages. Mr. Henry Eurice says that he read the contract of February 22, and that he read the paragraph with respect to the plans and specifications, but that he, too, thought it referred to the three-page proposal. Both agree that the plans were present at the time of the signing of the contract.</p>
<p id="031efd23-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the basis of the testimony which has been cited at some length, Judge Gontrum found the following:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="031efd24-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff, Mr. Ray, is an aeronautical engineer, a highly technical, precise gentleman, who has a truly remarkable memory for figures and dates and a meticulous regard for detail. Apparently, his profession and his training have schooled him to approach all problems in an exceedingly technical and probably very efficient manner. He testified with an exceptional fluency and plausibility. His mastery of language and recollection of dates and figures are phenomenal.</p>
<p id="031efd25-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendants in the case are what might be termed old fashioned country or community builders. Their work is technical but it doesn’t call for the specialized ability that Mr. Ray’s work demands. They conduct their business in a more easy going, hatchet and saw manner, and have apparently been successful in a small way in their field of home construction.</p>
<p id="031efd26-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The contract in question was entered into, in my judgment, in a hasty and rather careless fashion.</p>
</div>
<p id="031efd27-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Judge Gontrum then cites the testimony of the Eurice Brothers that they had not seen Specifications 1 through 5 when they signed, and then says:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="031efd28-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . There is real doubt in my mind about the matter. Why the defendants signed the agreement without checking up on the specifications, I do not know, but they clearly were under the impression that the specifications referred to in the agreement were the specifications they had submitted some time prior and which they had permitted to be redrafted by the attorney for Mr. Ray. They both stated with absolute emphasis, and I do not question their veracity, that they were under the impression that the specifications in the agreement were the same which they had prepared.</p>
</div>
<p id="031efd29-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">He concludes by saying that he feels that Mr. and Mrs. Ray were under one impression, and that the Messrs. Eurice were under another impression, saying:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="031f243a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . In my opinion there was an honest mistake; that there was no real meeting of the minds and that the plaintiffs and defendants had different sets of specifications in mind when this agreement was signed. The minds of the parties, so different in their approach, to use a mechanical phrase, did not mesh.</p>
</div>
<p id="031f243b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is unnecessary to decide, as we see it, whether there was or was not a mistake on the part of the Eurice Corporation. It does strain credulity to hear <span title="42" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-42">p. 42</span>that the Messrs. Eurice, builders all their adult lives and, on their own successful builders for fifteen years of some twenty houses a year, would sign a simple contract to build a house, after they had read it, without knowing exactly what obligations they were assuming as to specifications requirements. The contract clearly referred to the specifications by designation, by number of pages and by date. It permits, in terms, no deviations from the specified makes or brands to be incorporated in the house, without the express permission of the owner. This would have been unimportant if the Eurice three-page specifications had been intended, since generality and not particularity was the emphasis there. Again, the contract could scarcely have intended to incorporate by reference the specifications in the three-page proposal because they were not set forth in a separate writing, but were an integral part of a proposed contract, which itself was undated, and which was of <i>three</i> pages, while the specifications designated in the contract were dated and were stated to be in the contract, <i>five</i> pages. Further, it is undisputed that the five pages of February 14th were the seven pages of January 9, corrected to reflect the deletions and changes made and agreed to by Mr. Ray and Mr. John Eurice. The crowning challenge to credulity in finding mistake is the fact that admittedly the contract, the plans and the specifications were all signed at one sitting by the President of the Eurice Corporation at the Loyola Building Association, after they had been signed by Mr. and Mrs. Ray.</p>
<p id="031f243c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If we assume the view as to mistake held by Judge Gontrum, in effect the mistake in the written agreement which prevented its execution by the Eurice Corporation from making it a contract was an unilateral one. It consisted, in the opinion of the Court, in the Eurice Corporation thinking it was assenting to its own specifications, while in form it was assenting to the Ray specifications. If there was such a mistake, the legal result the Court found to follow, we think does not follow.</p>

First, its claimed intent is immaterial, where it has agreed in writing to a clearly expressed and unambiguous intent to the contrary.

<p id="031f4b55-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Williston (work cited), Sec. 21, states the rule as follows: “The only intent of the parties to a contract which is essential, is an intent to say the words and do the acts which constitute their manifestation of assent.” Judge Learned Hand expressed it in this wise: “A contract has, strictly speaking, nothing to do with the personal, or individual, intent of the parties. A contract is an obligation attached by the mere force of law to certain acts of the parties, usually words, which ordinarily accompany and represent a known intent. If, however, it were proved by twenty bishops that either party, when he used the words, intended something else than the usual meaning which the law imposes upon them, he would still be held, unless there were some mutual mistake, or something else of the sort.” Hotchkiss v. National City Bank, D.C., 200 F. 287, 293.</p>

<li class=""><p id="031f726b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The objective theory of contractual intent.</i> At one point the law may have looked for a true, or “subjective” intention on the part of the promisor. In any event, at least since Oliver Wendell Holmes’s lectures and writings in the 1880s began to have their effect, both the rhetoric and the actions of courts and writers have stressed an “objective theory” of contract obligation, by which one is ordinarily bound or not bound, not by her “secret intent” to that effect, but by the reasonable interpretation of her words and actions. Indeed, the objective approach to contract formation and interpretation was seen as one of the central tenets of classical contract law.</p>
<p id="031f726c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In his famous 1881 set of lectures, Holmes stated, “The law has nothing to do with the actual state of the parties’ minds. In contract, as elsewhere, it must go by externals, and judge parties by their conduct.” Oliver Wendell Holmes, The Common Law 242 (Mark DeWolfe Howe ed. 1963). Later Holmes offered what we would today call a policy justification for the objective approach, based on principles of efficiency and fairness: Inquiry into the subjective intentions of the parties would “greatly enhance the difficulty of enforcing contracts” (efficiency) and would be unfair because both parties are on notice that their words would be understood “according to usage of the normal speaker of English under the circumstance” (fairness). Oliver Wendell Holmes, The Theory of Legal Interpretation, 12 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 419 (1899).</p>
<p id="031f726d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Judge Learned Hand’s “twenty bishops” observation, invoked by the court in <i>Ray</i>, has become the classic statement of the strict objectivist position, which as the <i>Ray</i> court indicates was espoused also by Williston. The Restatement (Second) rejects the subjective approach in §21. As we shall see, this does not mean that the promisor’s intention to be bound (real or apparent) is never significant; in some situations it may be extremely relevant. For the most part, however, the law looks merely for a sufficient expression of apparent commitment to perform. Did the court in the Allen v. Bissinger case in Chapter 1 appear to apply this same legal standard?</p>
<p id="031f726e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Are the social policies served by the objective theory of contracts, as advocated by Holmes, Williston, and Hand reflected in the <i>Ray</i> decision? Does it appear to you that any important social goals would be served by using a subjective test, enforcing only those contracts that appear to reflect a true “meeting of the minds”?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="031f726f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Credibility of the parties.</i> Does it appear to you that Judge Hammond, the author of the Maryland Court of Appeals’ opinion in <i>Ray,</i> believed the Eurice brothers’ testimony? Do you? Under the view of the case taken by the <span title="45" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-45">p. 45</span>Appellate Court, is the issue of their veracity material to the outcome of the case? Should it be?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="031f9980-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Nature of the parties.</i> Although contract law typically assumes the interaction of hypothetical individuals (e.g., the ubiquitous <i>A, B,</i> and sometimes <i>C</i> of the illustrations to both Restatements), in real life it is common for at least one of the contracting parties to be a business enterprise, conducting its affairs through the medium of a corporation. This was true in the <i>Ray</i> case, where the defendant was a corporation, although it seems to have been essentially the creature of the two Eurice brothers, John and Henry. Do you think John and Henry Eurice were equally involved in and aware of the negotiations with Calvin and Katherine Ray? If not, what effect might that fact have had on the progress of those negotiations?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="031f9981-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Disparity in bargaining power.</i> One of the central features of classical contract law was that it ignored any imbalances in bargaining power — in economic resources, knowledge, and a host of other factors — that might exist between the parties. In <i>Ray,</i> the Eurice brothers appear to have been knowledgeable in the construction business and the Rays were not (although Calvin Ray seems to have made up in compulsive attention to detail what he might have lacked in expertise), so it is perhaps not surprising if the court holds the Eurices to a high standard of self-protection in the bargaining process. But the principle applied against the defendant in <i>Ray</i> is not limited in its application to knowledgeable or powerful contractors. See Skrbina v. Fleming Cos., 53 Cal. Rptr. 2d 481, 485 (Ct. App. 1996) (applying the objective theory to an employee’s signed writing that included release of his wrongful termination claims; employee asserted he understood signing was only a formality necessary to obtain his severance pay).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="031f9982-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Does the signing party have a “duty to read” what she signs?</i> In reaching results like those in the <i>Ray</i> and <i>Skrbina</i> cases, courts sometimes declare that the person who signs a document that was apparently intended to have legal effect should be held to its terms because she has a “duty to read” what she signs. In a recent article, Professor Knapp considers this proposition, and concludes that at most it should be limited to a “presumption of knowing assent,” rebuttable by evidence to the contrary, and susceptible to being limited or overcome by other contract law principles such as duress, fraud, mistake, and unconscionability. Charles L. Knapp, Is There a “Duty to Read?”, 66 Hastings L.J. 1083 (2015).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="031f9983-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Is the promisor serious?</i> Occasionally, the maker of a promise will claim that it was not made with serious intent — it was only a joke, and the other party either knew that, or at least reasonably <i>should have</i> known it. In Lucy v. Zehmer, 84 S.E.2d 516 (Va. 1954), a land-purchase contract was enforced by the buyer despite the seller’s contention that he was only joking and had believed that the buyer was, too. The court found that, despite the setting (a conversation over drinks in a bar), the past dealings between the parties made it reasonable for the buyer to believe that the seller was serious, and the seller should reasonably have known that.

The court found that no reasonable person would interpret the advertisement as having been seriously intended.</p></li>

<p id="031fc097-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the first chapter, we suggested that the notion of “contract” typically involves an element of futurity: a commitment to some course of action to be undertaken in the future. Although important types of transactions are exceptions, it also seems likely that most contracts of commercial importance will involve commitments on <i>both</i> sides: an exchange of promises in which each party promises to do something for the other. Such agreements have traditionally been referred to in the contract lexicon as “bilateral contracts.” (Note: Our use of the term “bilateral” doesn’t simply mean there are two parties; <i>every</i> contract involves at least two persons, and maybe more. The label “bilateral contract” is a legal “term of art,” referring to a particular type of contract, one formed by the exchange of promises.) Since they involve an exchange of reciprocal commitments, bilateral contracts were seen by the classical theorists as typically being the product of a negotiating process often referred to as “offer and acceptance.”</p>
<p id="031fc098-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This process was envisioned as ordinarily involving something like the following: First, the parties engage in a period of preliminary negotiation, exchanging communications of a more or less detailed nature about the type of exchange of performances to which each would be willing to agree. Next, one party (the “offeror”) makes an “offer” — a direct, complete proposal that a contract be entered into, providing for an exchange of defined performances. This has the effect of creating in the party to which that offer is addressed (the “offeree”) a “power of acceptance.” If that other party manifests her “acceptance” of the offer in a legally effective way, then at that moment a contract comes into being. If the initial offer is not acceptable, however, the offeree may respond by making a “counter-offer” of her own, which may in turn be accepted by the original offeror (thus giving rise to a contract different from the one he originally proposed). Of course, a contract may never come into being at all; the offeree may simply reject the original offer without making one of her own in return. Or, the offeree may delay too long in accepting, so that the power of acceptance created by the offer has been terminated, either by a time limit (explicit or implicit) contained in the offer itself, or by the offeror’s withdrawal (“revocation”) of his offer.</p>
<p id="031fc099-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Such is the process of agreement-making on which the rules of classical contract law are premised. As succeeding chapters will demonstrate, it is no longer true — if it ever was — that this model of the bargaining process necessarily describes the way people actually behave. The number of types of <span title="47" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-47">p. 47</span>exchange-agreements that fall within our definition of contract is staggeringly large, and in many instances the process of contract formation is radically different from the one described above. As a starting point, however, we will look at some characteristic applications of the traditional rules of contract law to disputes between persons who have engaged in the process of attempting to reach mutual agreement to a bargained-for exchange of promises — in other words, a “bilateral contract.”</p>

<p id="031fe7b1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The complaint alleged that on April 15, 1952, the parties entered into a contract whereby the defendant agreed to sell, and plaintiff agreed to buy a 40-acre tract of land for $2,500; that this was a fair, just and reasonable value of the property; that on April 28, 1952, the defendant repudiated the contract and refused to deliver a deed; that on April 28, 1952, the property was worth $6,081; and that plaintiff has been damaged in the amount of $3,581. The answer denied that any contract had been entered into, or that anything was due to the plaintiff.</p>
<p id="031fe7b2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By stipulation, the issue of whether or not a contract was entered into between the parties was first tried, reserving the other issues for a further trial if that became necessary. The issue as to the existence of a contract was submitted upon an agreed statement, including certain letters between the parties, without the introduction of other evidence.</p>
<p id="031fe7b3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The stipulated facts are as follows: During March, 1952, the defendant placed an ad in a Los Angeles paper reading, so far as material here, “Joshua Tree vic. 40 acres,  . . . need cash, will sacrifice.” In response to an inquiry resulting from this ad the defendant, who lived in New York, wrote a letter to the plaintiff dated March 26, briefly describing the property, giving directions as to how to get there, stating that his rock-bottom price was $2,500 cash, and further stating that “This is a form letter.” On April 7, the plaintiff wrote a letter to the defendant saying that he was not sure he had found the property, asking for its legal description, asking whether the land was all level or whether it included certain jutting rock hills, and suggesting a certain bank as escrow agent “should I desire to purchase the land.” On April 8, the defendant wrote to the plaintiff saying “From your description you have found the property”; that this bank “is O.K. for escrow agent”; that the land was fairly level; giving the legal description; and then saying, “If you are really interested, you will have to decide fast, as I expect to have a buyer in the next week or so.” On April 12, the defendant sold the property to a third party for $2,500. The plaintiff received defendant’s letter of April 8 on April 14. On April 15 he wrote to the defendant thanking him for his letter “confirming that I was on the right land,” <span title="48" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-48">p. 48</span>stating that he would immediately proceed to have the escrow opened and would deposit $2,500 therein “in conformity with your offer,” and asking the defendant to forward a deed with his instructions to the escrow agent. On April 17, 1952, the plaintiff started an escrow and placed in the hands of the escrow agent $100, agreeing to furnish an additional $2,400 at an unspecified time, with the provision that if the escrow was not closed by May 15, 1952, it should be completed as soon thereafter as possible unless a written demand for a return of the money or instruments was made by either party after that date. It was further stipulated that the plaintiff was ready and willing at all times to deposit the $2,400.</p>
<p id="031fe7b4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The matter was submitted on June 11, 1953. On July 10, 1953, the judge filed a memorandum opinion stating that it was his opinion that the letter of April 8, 1952, when considered with the previous correspondence, constituted an offer of sale which offer was, however, qualified and conditioned upon prompt acceptance by the plaintiff; that in spite of the condition thus imposed, the plaintiff delayed more than a week before notifying the defendant of his acceptance; and that since the plaintiff was aware of the necessity of promptly communicating his acceptance to the defendant his delay was not the prompt action required by the terms of the offer. Findings of fact were filed on October 2, 1953, finding that each and all of the statements in the agreed statement are true, and that all allegations to the contrary in the complaint are untrue. As conclusions of law, it was found that the plaintiff and defendant did not enter into a contract as alleged in the complaint or otherwise, and that the defendant is entitled to judgment against the plaintiff. Judgment was entered accordingly, from which the plaintiff has appealed.</p>
<p id="031fe7b5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The appellant contends that the judgment is contrary to the evidence and to the law since the facts, as found, do not support the conclusions of law upon which the judgment is based. It is argued that there is no conflict in the evidence, and this court is not bound by the trial court’s construction of the written instruments involved; that the evidence conclusively shows that an offer was made to the plaintiff by the defendant, which offer was accepted by the mailing of plaintiff’s letter of April 15; that upon receipt of defendant’s letter of April 8 the plaintiff had a reasonable time within which to accept the offer that had been made; that by his letter of April 15 and his starting of an escrow the plaintiff accepted said offer; and that the agreed statement of facts establishes that a valid contract was entered into between the parties. In his briefs the appellant assumes that an offer was made by the defendant, and confined his argument to contending that the evidence shows that he accepted that offer within a reasonable time.</p>
<p id="031fe7b6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There can be no contract unless the minds of the parties have met and mutually agreed upon some specific thing. This is usually evidenced by one party making an offer which is accepted by the other party. Section 25 of the Restatement of the Law on Contracts reads:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="031fe7b7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If from a promise, or manifestation of intention, or from the circumstances existing at the time, the person to whom the promise or manifestation is addressed knows or has reason to know that the person making it does not <span title="49" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-49">p. 49</span>intend it as an expression of his fixed purpose until he has given a further expression of assent, he has not made an offer.</p>
</div>
<p id="031fe7b8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The language used in Niles v. Hancock, 140 Cal. 157, 73 P. 840, 842, “It is also clear from the correspondence that it was the intention of the defendant that the negotiations between him and the plaintiff were to be purely preliminary,” is applicable here. The correspondence here indicates an intention on the part of the defendant to find out whether the plaintiff was interested, rather than an intention to make a definite offer to the plaintiff. The language used by the defendant in his letters of March 26 and April 8 rather clearly discloses that they were not intended as an expression of fixed purpose to make a definite offer, and was sufficient to advise the plaintiff that some further expression of assent on the part of the defendant was necessary.</p>
<p id="031fe7b9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The advertisement in the paper was a mere request for an offer. The letter of March 26 contains no definite offer, and clearly states that it is a form letter. It merely gives further particulars, in clarification of the advertisement, and tells the plaintiff how to locate the property if he was interested in looking into the matter. The letter of April 8 added nothing in the way of a definite offer. It merely answered some questions asked by the plaintiff, and stated that if the plaintiff was really interested he would have to act fast. The statement that he expected to have a buyer in the next week or so indicated that the defendant intended to sell to the first-comer, and was reserving the right to do so. From this statement, alone, the plaintiff knew or should have known that he was not being given time in which to accept an offer that was being made, but that some further assent on the part of the defendant was required. Under the language used the plaintiff was not being given a right to act within a reasonable time after receiving the letter; he was plainly told that the defendant intended to sell to another, if possible, and warned that he would have to act fast if he was interested in buying the land . . . .</p>

<li class=""><p id="03200ece-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Was there an offer?</i> To the appellate court that decided <i>Lonergan,</i> the principal issue was whether an offer had been made. Many contract cases have turned on the question whether a given communication did amount in legal contemplation to an offer, or whether it was merely a “preliminary negotiation” or an “invitation for an offer.” The words used by the parties will be relevant, but not necessarily decisive; even a communication that uses the word <i>offer</i> may not be held to be an offer in the legal sense. E.g., Moulton v. Kershaw, 18 N.W. 172 (Wis. 1884) (“we are authorized to offer Michigan fine salt, in full car-load lots of 80 to 95 bbls  . . . at 85c. per bbl . . .” held to be only an invitation for offers). See Restatement (Second) §24 (an offer invites assent to conclude the bargain). Restatement (Second) §26 provides that a communication is not <span title="50" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-50">p. 50</span>an offer if the person making the communication does not intend to enter into a bargain until the person has made a “further manifestation of assent.” See Kerns v. Range Res.-Appalachia, LLC, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4473 (N.D.W. Va.) (holding that defendant’s communication that it “would consider” a delayed lease did not constitute an offer under Restatement (Second) §§24, 26 and illustration 4). Applying §§24 and 26, what factors are relevant to resolution of this issue? Would you agree with the court in <i>Lonergan</i> that the defendant’s letter of April 8 did not rise to the level of an offer?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03200ecf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>An alternate basis for the</i> <b>Lonergan</b> 
<i>result: The “mailbox rule.”</i> In <i>Lonergan,</i> the trial court also held that the plaintiff could not recover, but not because the defendant never made an offer; it ruled that the plaintiff had failed to make a timely acceptance. Does the Appellate Court’s basis for decision appear to you a better one? If the defendant’s letter of April 8 had amounted legally to an offer, then it would be necessary to decide how long the plaintiff’s power of acceptance lasted, and whether he effectively accepted before it terminated. The plaintiff responded by mailing a letter of attempted acceptance on April 15; if on that date there was actually an offer still open for acceptance, would plaintiff’s act of mailing that letter have completed the formation of a contract?</p>
<p id="03200ed0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although Anglo-American common law has traditionally held that both an offer and a revocation (by the offeror) must be <i>received</i> to be effective, an acceptance (by the <i>offeree</i>) will in some circumstances be treated as effective as soon as it was dispatched (mailed, telegraphed, etc.) by the offeree. E.g., Morton’s of Chicago/Great Neck LLC v. Crab House, Inc., 746 N.Y.S.2d 317 (App. Div. 2002) (oral acceptance of written lease renewal agreement effective; even if not, acceptor mailed written acceptance before offeror faxed its notice of revocation); compare Gibbs v. American Sav. &amp; Loan Assn., 266 Cal. Rptr. 517 (Ct. App. 1990) (offer not accepted merely by plaintiff giving it to mail clerk in her office; acceptance would occur only when deposited in U.S. mail, by which time revocation had been received). See generally Restatement (Second) §§63 (basic rule, exception for option contracts), 65 (medium of acceptance must be reasonable in circumstances), 66 (only applies where acceptance properly stamped, addressed, etc.). This rule — commonly known as the “deposited acceptance,” or “mailbox” rule — will not apply, however, if the offeror has stated (expressly or by implication) that he must <i>receive</i> the acceptance for it to be effective. Restatement (Second) §§30, 63. This rule follows from the general concept that the offeror is the “master of the offer.” Id. §29, Comment <i>a</i>.</p>
<p id="032035e1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Should the mailbox rule apply to contracts formed over the Internet? See Amelia Rawls, Contract Formation in an Internet Age, 10 Colum. Sci. &amp; Tech. L. Rev. 200 (2009) (arguing that in an era of “near-instantaneous” electronic communication, acceptances should be treated as valid on receipt).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="032035e2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The deposited acceptance rule under the CISG</i>. We noted earlier that the United States is a party to the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). In Article 16(1), the CISG adopts a version of the mailbox rule, by providing that an otherwise revocable offer cannot be revoked once an <span title="51" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-51">p. 51</span>acceptance has been dispatched. CISG Article 18(2) modifies the common law mailbox rule, however, by placing the risk of non-arrival of the acceptance on the offeree rather than the offeror. Thus, to be legally effective in concluding the bargain at the time of its dispatch, the acceptance must actually reach the offeror in a timely fashion. A “lost acceptance” would not have that effect. See William S. Dodge, Teaching the CISG in Contracts, 50 J. Leg. Ed. 72, 81 (2000) (“CISG’s rule  . . . places the risk of a lost communication on the party who is in the best position to prevent that loss by choosing a more reliable means of communication”).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="032035e3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Advertisements as invitations to receive offers.</i> The general rule is that advertisements constitute invitations to receive offers rather than actual offers. See Comment <i>b</i> to Restatement (Second) §26: “Advertisements of goods by display, sign, handbill, newspaper, radio or television are not ordinarily intended or understood as offers to sell . . . . [T]o make an offer by an advertisement  . . . there must ordinarily be some language of commitment or some invitation to take action without further communication.” See Zanakis-Pico v. Cutter Dodge, Inc., 47 P.3d 1222 (Haw. 2002) (following “well-established principles,” advertisements are generally not offers unless they invite acceptance without further negotiations in clear, definite, express, and unconditional language). The leading case finding an advertisement to be an offer is Lefkowitz v. Great Minneapolis Surplus Store, 86 N.W.2d 689 (Minn. 1957) where the defendant advertised one or two items of each kind — fur coats, etc. — at extremely low prices, with the additional language “first come, first served.” In addition, if the seller is apparently engaged in “bait and switch” or other deceptive conduct, the court may treat the advertisement as an offer or may subject the seller to liability under unfair trade practice or other consumer protection statutes. See Izadi v. Machado (Gus) Ford, Inc., 550 So. 2d 1135 (Fl. Dist. Ct. App. 1989).</p></li>

<p id="03205cfa-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant Hazel Miller owned real estate located in Charlotte, North Carolina. On 4 August 1980, the property was listed for sale with a local realtor, Gladys Hawkins. On that same day, Richard Byer, a real estate broker with the realty firm Gallery of Homes, showed the property to the prospective purchasers, Plaintiffs Normile and Kurniawan. Afterwards, Byer helped plaintiffs prepare a written offer to purchase the property. A Gallery of Homes form, entitled “DEPOSIT RECEIPT AND CONTRACT FOR PURCHASE AND SALE OF REAL ESTATE,” containing blanks for the insertion of terms pertinent to the purchasers’ offer, was completed in quadruplicate and signed by Normile and Kurniawan. One specific standard provision in Paragraph 9 included a blank that was filled in with the time and date to read as follows: “OFFER &amp; CLOSING DATE: Time is of the essence, therefore this offer must be accepted <span title="52" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-52">p. 52</span>on or before <i>5:00 p.m. Aug. 5th 1980.</i> A signed copy shall be promptly returned to the purchaser.”</p>
<p id="0320840b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Byer took the offer to purchase form to Gladys Hawkins, who presented it to defendant. Later that evening, Gladys Hawkins returned the executed form to Byer. It had been signed under seal by defendant, with several changes in the terms having been made thereon and initialed by defendant. The primary changes made by defendant were an increase in the earnest money deposit ($100 to $500); an increase in the down payment due at closing ($875 to $1,000); a decrease in the unpaid principal of the existing mortgage amount ($18,525 to $18,000); a decrease in the term of the loan from seller (25 years to 20 years); and a purchaser qualification contingency added in the outer margin of the form.</p>
<p id="0320ab1c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That same evening, Byer presented defendant’s counteroffer to Plaintiff Normile. Byer testified in his deposition that Normile did not have $500 for the earnest money deposit, one of the requirements of defendant’s counteroffer. Also, Byer stated that Normile did not “want to go 25 [sic] years because he wanted lower payments.” Byer was under the impression at this point that Normile thought he had first option on the property and that “nobody else could put an offer in on it and buy it while he had this counteroffer, so he was going to wait awhile before he decided what to do with it.” Normile, however, neither accepted or rejected the counteroffer at this point, according to Byer. When this meeting closed, Byer left the pink copy of the offer to purchase form containing defendant’s counteroffer with Normile. Byer stated that he thought that Normile had rejected the counteroffer at this point.</p>
<p id="0320ab1d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At approximately 12:30 <span class="epub-small-caps">a.m.</span> on 5 August, Byer went to the home of Plaintiff Segal, who signed an offer to purchase with terms very similar to those contained in defendant’s counteroffer to Plaintiffs Normile and Kurniawan. This offer was accepted, without change, by defendant. Later that same day, at approximately 2:00 <span class="epub-small-caps">p.m</span>., Byer informed Plaintiff Normile that defendant had revoked her counteroffer by commenting to Normile, “[Y]ou snooze, you lose; the property has been sold.” Prior to 5:00 <span class="epub-small-caps">p.m</span>. on that same day, Normile and Kurniawan initialed the offer to purchase form containing defendant’s counteroffer and delivered the form to the Gallery of Homes’ office, along with the earnest money deposit of $500.</p>
<p id="0320ab1e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Separate actions were filed by plaintiff-appellants and appellee seeking specific performance. Plaintiff Segal’s motion for consolidation of the trials was granted. Defendant, in her answer, recognized the validity of the contract between her and Plaintiff Segal. However, because of the action for specific performance commenced by Plaintiffs Normile and Kurniawan, defendant contended that she was unable to legally convey title to Plaintiff Segal. Both plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff Segal’s motion for summary judgment was granted by the trial court, and defendant was ordered to specifically perform the contract to convey the property to Segal. Plaintiffs Normile and Kurniawan appealed to the Court of Appeals from the trial court’s denial of their motion for summary judgment. That court unanimously affirmed the trial court’s actions. Discretionary review was allowed by this Court on petition of Plaintiffs Normile and Kurniawan.<span title="53" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-53">p. 53</span></p>
<p id="0320ab1f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>I</b></p>
<p id="0320ab20-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . [We] begin with a brief description of how a typical sale of real estate is consummated. The broker, whose primary duty is to secure a ready, willing, and able buyer for the seller’s property, generally initiates a potential sale by procuring the prospective purchaser’s signature on an offer to purchase instrument. J. Webster, North Carolina Real Estate for Brokers and Salesmen, §8.03 (1974). “An ‘offer to purchase’ is simply an offer by a purchaser to buy property,  . . . ” J. Webster, supra, §8.03. This instrument contains the prospective purchaser’s “offer” of the terms he wishes to propose to the seller. Id.</p>
<p id="0320ab21-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Usually, this offer to purchase is a printed form with blanks that are filled in and completed by the broker. Among the various clauses contained in such an instrument, it is not uncommon for the form to contain “a clause stipulating that the seller must accept the offer and approve the sale within a certain specified period of time,  . . . The inclusion of a date within which the seller must accept simply indicates that the offer will automatically expire at the termination of the named period if the seller does not accept before then.” Id. §8.10. Such a clause is contained in Paragraph 9 of the offer to purchase form in the case <i>sub judice.</i></p>
<p id="0320ab22-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the instant case, the offerors, plaintiffs-appellants, submitted their offer to purchase defendant’s property. This offer contained a Paragraph 9, requiring that “this offer must be accepted on or before 5:00 p.m. Aug. 5th 1980.” Thus the offeree’s, defendant-seller’s, power of acceptance was controlled by the duration of time for acceptance of the offer. Restatement (Second) of Contracts §35 (1981). “The offeror is the creator of the power, and before it leaves his hands, he may fashion it to his will  . . . if he names a specific period for its existence, the offeree can accept only during this period.” Corbin, Offer and Acceptance, and Some of the Resulting Legal Relations, 26 Yale L.J. 169, at 183 (1917); see Restatement, supra, §41; S. Williston, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts §53 (1957).</p>
<p id="0320d233-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This offer to purchase remains only an offer until the seller accepts it on the terms contained in the original offer by the prospective purchaser. J. Webster, supra, §8.10. If the seller does accept the terms in the purchaser’s offer, he denotes this by signing the offer to purchase at the bottom, thus forming a valid, binding, and irrevocable purchase contract between the seller and purchaser. However, if the seller purports to accept but changes or modifies the terms of the offer, he makes what is generally referred to as a qualified or conditional acceptance. Richardson v. Greensboro Warehouse &amp; Storage Co., 223 N.C. 344, 26 S.E.2d 897 (1943); Wilson v. W. M. Storey Lumber Co., 180 N.C. 271, 104 S.E. 531 (1920); 17 Am. Jur. 2d Contracts §62 (1964). “The effect of such an acceptance so conditioned is to make a new counter-proposal upon which the parties have not yet agreed, but which is open for acceptance or rejection.” (Citations omitted.) <i>Richardson,</i> 223 N.C. at 347, 26 S.E.2d at 899. Such a reply from the seller is actually a counteroffer and a rejection of the buyer’s offer. J. Webster, supra, §8.10.</p>
<p id="0320d234-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These basic principles of contract law are recognized not only in real estate transactions but in bargaining situations generally. It is axiomatic that a valid <span title="54" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-54">p. 54</span>contract between two parties can only exist when the parties “assent to the same thing in the same sense, and their minds meet as to all terms.” Goeckel v. Stokely, 236 N.C. 604, 607, 73 S.E.2d 618, 620 (1952). This assent, or meeting of the minds, requires an offer and acceptance in the exact terms and that the acceptance must be communicated to the offeror . . . . “If the terms of the offer are changed or any new ones added by the acceptance, there is no meeting of the minds and, consequently, no contract.” G. Thompson, supra, §4452. This counter-offer amounts to a rejection of the original offer. S. Williston, supra, §51. “The reason is that the counter-offer is interpreted as being in effect the statement by the offeree not only that he will enter into the transaction on the terms stated in his counteroffer, but also by implication that he will not assent to the terms of the original offer.” Id. §36.</p>
<p id="0320d235-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question then becomes, did defendant-seller accept plaintiff-appellants’ offer prior to the expiration of the time limit contained within the offer? We conclude that she did not. The offeree, defendant-seller, changed the original offer in several material respects, most notably in the terms regarding payment of the purchase price. S. Williston, supra, §77 (any alteration in the method of payment creates a conditional acceptance). This qualified acceptance was in reality a rejection of the plaintiff-appellants original offer because it was coupled with certain modifications or changes that were not contained in the original offer. G. Thompson, supra, §4452. Additionally, defendant-seller’s conditional acceptance amounted to a counter-offer to plaintiff-appellants. “A counter-offer is an offer made by an offeree to his offeror relating to the same matter as the original offer and proposing a substituted bargain differing from that proposed by the original offer.” Restatement, supra, §39. Between plaintiff-appellants and defendant-seller there was no meeting of the minds, since the parties failed to assent to the same thing in the same sense.</p>
<p id="0320d236-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In substance, defendant’s conditional acceptance modifying the original offer did not manifest any intent to accept the terms of the original offer, including the time-for-acceptance provision, unless and until the original offeror accepted the terms included in defendant’s counteroffer. The offeree, by failing to unconditionally assent to the terms of the original offer and instead qualifying his acceptance with terms of his own, in effect says to the original offeror, “I will accept your offer, provided you [agree to my proposed terms].” Rucker v. Sanders, 182 N.C. 607, 609, 109 S.E. 857, 858 (1921). Thus, the time-for-acceptance provision contained in plaintiff-appellants’ original offer did not become part of the terms of the counter-offer. And, of course, if they had accepted the counteroffer from defendant, a binding purchase contract, which would have included the terms of the original offer and counteroffer, would have then resulted. J. Webster, supra, §8.03 . . . .</p>
<p id="0320d237-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is generally recognized that “[a]n ‘option’ is a contract by which the owner agrees to give another the exclusive right to buy property at a fixed price within a specified time.” 8A G. Thompson, Commentaries on the Modern Law of Real Property, §4443 (1963); Sandlin v. Weaver, 240 N.C. 703, 83 S.E.2d 806 (1954). In effect, an owner of property agrees to hold his offer open for a specified period of time. G. Thompson, supra, §4443. This option contract must also <span title="55" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-55">p. 55</span>be supported by valuable consideration. Id. Disregarding the issue of consideration, it is more significant that defendant’s counteroffer did not contain any promise or agreement that her counteroffer would remain open for a specified period of time.</p>
<p id="0320d238-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Several of the cases cited by plaintiff-appellants are useful in illustrating how a seller expressly agrees to hold his offer open. For instance, in Ward v. Albertson, 165 N.C. 218, 81 S.E. 168 (1914), this Court stated, “An option, in the proper sense, is a contract by which the owner of property agrees with another that he shall have the right to purchase the same at a fixed price within a certain time.” Id at 222-23, 81 S.E. at 169 . . . .</p>
<p id="0320d239-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In each of these  . . . cases, this Court recognized that the sellers had given the prospective purchasers a contractual option to purchase the seller’s property. In the present case we find no comparable language within defendant-seller’s counteroffer manifesting any similar agreement. There is no language indicating that defendant-seller in any way agreed to sell or convey her real property to plaintiff-appellants at their request within a specified period of time. There is, however, language contained within the prospective purchasers’ offer to purchase that does state, “DESCRIPTION: I/we Michael M. Normile and Wawie Kurniawan hereby <i>agree to purchase</i> from the sellers, . . .” and “<i>this</i> offer must be accepted on or before 5:00 p.m. Aug. 5th 1980.” (Emphasis added.) Nowhere is there companion language to the effect that Defendant Miller “hereby agrees to sell or convey to the purchasers” if they accept by a certain date.</p>
<p id="0320d23a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Therefore, regardless of whether or not the seal imported the necessary consideration, we conclude that defendant-seller made no promise or agreement to hold her offer open. Thus, a necessary ingredient to the creation of an option contract, i.e., a promise to hold an offer open for a specified time, is not present. Accordingly, we hold that defendant’s counteroffer was not transformed into an irrevocable offer for the time limit contained in the original offer because the defendant’s conditional acceptance did not include the time-for-acceptance provision as part of its terms and because defendant did not make any promise to hold her counteroffer open for any stated time.</p>

<p id="0320f94c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The foregoing preliminary analysis of both the Court of Appeals’ opinion and plaintiff-appellants’ argument in their brief prefaces what we consider to be decisive of the ultimate issue to be resolved. Basic contract principles effectively and logically answer the primary issue in this appeal. That is, if a seller rejects a prospective purchaser’s offer to purchase but makes a counteroffer that is not accepted by the prospective purchaser, does the prospective purchaser have the power to accept after he receives notice that the counteroffer has been revoked? The answer is no. The net effect of defendant-seller’s counteroffer and rejection is twofold. First, plaintiff-appellants’ original offer was rejected and ceased to exist. S. Williston, supra, §51. Secondly, the counteroffer by the offeree requires the original offeror, plaintiff-appellants, to either accept or reject. Benya v. Stevens &amp; Thompson Paper Co., Inc., 143 Vt. 521, 468 A.2d 929 (1983).</p>
<p id="0320f94d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="56" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-56">p. 56</span>Accordingly, the next question is did plaintiff-appellants, the original offerors, accept or reject defendant-seller’s counteroffer? Plaintiff-appellants in their brief seem to answer this question when they state, “At the time Byer presented the counteroffer to Normile, Normile neither accepted nor rejected it . . . .” Therefore, plaintiff-appellants did not manifest any intent to agree to or accept the terms contained in defendant’s counteroffer. Normile instead advised Byer that he, though mistakenly, had an option on the property and that it was off the market for the duration of the time limitation contained in his original offer. As was stated by Justice Bobbitt in Howell v. Smith, 258 N.C. 150, 128 S.E.2d 144 (1962): “ ‘The question whether a contract has been made must be determined from a consideration of the expressed intention of the parties — that is from a consideration of their words and acts.’ ” Id. at 153, 128 S.E.2d at 146. Although Normile’s mistaken belief that he had an option is unfortunate, he still failed to express to Byer his agreement to or rejection of the counteroffer made by defendant-seller . . . .</p>
<p id="0320f94e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff-appellants in the instant case  . . . did not accept, either expressly or by conduct, defendant’s counteroffer. In addition to disagreeing with the change in payment terms, Normile stated to Byer that “he was going to wait awhile before he decided what to do with [the counteroffer].” Neither did plaintiffs explicitly reject defendant’s counteroffer. Instead, plaintiff-appellants in this case chose to operate under the impression, though mistaken, that they had an option to purchase and that the property was “off the market.” Absent either an acceptance or rejection, there was no meeting of the minds or mutual assent between the parties, a fortiori, there was no contract. Horton v. Humble Oil &amp; Refining Co., 255 N.C. 675, 122 S.E.2d 716 (1961); Goeckel, 236 N.C. 604, 73 S.E.2d 618 (1952).</p>
<p id="0320f94f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is evident from the record that after plaintiff-appellants failed to accept defendant’s counteroffer, there was a second purchaser, Plaintiff-appellee Segal, who submitted an offer to defendant that was accepted. This offer and acceptance between the latter parties, together with consideration in the form of an earnest money deposit from plaintiff-appellee, ripened into a valid and binding purchase contract.</p>
<p id="0320f950-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By entering into the contract with Plaintiff-appellee Segal, defendant manifested her intention to revoke her previous counteroffer to plaintiff-appellants. “It is a fundamental tenet of the common law that an offer is generally freely revocable and can be countermanded by the offeror at any time before it has been accepted by the offeree.” E. Farnsworth, Contracts, §3.17 (1982); Restatement, supra, §42. The revocation of an offer terminates it, and the offeree has no power to revive the offer by any subsequent attempts to accept. G. Thompson, supra, §4452.</p>
<p id="03212061-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Generally, notice of the offeror’s revocation must be communicated to the offeree to effectively terminate the offeree’s power to accept the offer. It is enough that the offeree receives reliable information, even indirectly, “that the offeror had taken definite action inconsistent with an intention to make the contract.” E. Farnsworth, supra, §3.17 (the author cites Dickinson v. Dodds, 2 Ch. Div. 463 (1876), a notorious English case, to support this proposition); Restatement, supra, §43.</p>
<p id="03212062-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="57" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-57">p. 57</span>In this case, plaintiff-appellants received notice of the offeror’s revocation of the counteroffer in the afternoon of August 5, when Byer saw Normile and told him, “[Y]ou snooze, you lose; the property has been sold.” Later that afternoon, plaintiff-appellants initialed the counteroffer and delivered it to the Gallery of Homes, along with their earnest money deposit of $500. These subsequent attempts by plaintiff-appellants to accept defendant’s revoked counteroffer were fruitless, however, since their power of acceptance had been effectively terminated by the offeror’s revocation. Restatement, supra, §36. Since defendant’s counteroffer could not be revived, the practical effect of plaintiff-appellants’ initialing defendant’s counteroffer and leaving it at the broker’s office before 5:00 <span class="epub-small-caps">p.m.</span> on August 5 was to resubmit a new offer. This offer was not accepted by defendant since she had already contracted to sell her property by entering into a valid, binding, and irrevocable purchase contract with Plaintiff-appellee Segal.</p>

<li class=""><p id="03214776-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Classical principles of offer and acceptance.</i> The court in <i>Normile</i> cites and applies many classical rules of offer and acceptance, as expressed in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, including the following:</p>
<ul class="">
<li class=""><p id="03214777-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The power of acceptance created by an offer will be terminated by the offeree’s rejection (as well as by other events, such as revocation by the offeror, or his death or incapacity). Restatement (Second) of Contracts §36.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03214778-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An acceptance must be unequivocal and unqualified in order for a contract to be formed. Restatement (Second) §§57 and 58. See, e.g., Beastie Boys v. Monster Energy Co., 983 F. Supp. 2d 338, 350 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (in course of negotiation of contract for music license, word “Dope!” could conceivably signify acceptance of offer, but in context was not sufficiently “clear, unambiguous and unequivocal”); Confederate Motors, Inc. v. Terny, 831 F. Supp. 2d 414, 422 (D. Mass. 2011) (attorney’s statement that his client was “prepared to accept” offer did not in the circumstances amount to present communication of acceptance). Note that silence by the offeree rarely amounts to acceptance, but in some limited circumstances an offeree’s silence may result in the formation of a contract. See Restatement (Second) §69.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03214779-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A “qualified acceptance” constitutes only a counter-offer, Restatement (Second) §59, and as such will have the same effect as a rejection, insofar as the original power of acceptance is concerned. Restatement (Second) §39. E.g., Ehlen v. Melvin, 823 N.W.2d 780, 784 (N.D. 2012) (where offeree made substantive changes to agreement before signing it, mere fact that agreement stated “This is a legally binding contract” did not make it more than counter-offer).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li class=""><p id="0321477a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="58" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-58">p. 58</span><i>Policy analysis of classical rules</i>. What policy justifies the rule that the offeree’s power of acceptance is terminated by his rejection of the offer? Does that policy apply with equal force to the case where the offeree makes a counter-offer? Professor Melvin Eisenberg has argued that the counter-offer-equals-rejection rule of Restatement (Second) §39(2) is not congruent with the normal understanding of most bargainers, and ought to be either abandoned entirely, or “dropped to the form of a maxim.” Melvin A. Eisenberg, Expression Rules in Contract Law and Problems of Offer and Acceptance, 82 Cal. L. Rev. 1127, 1158-1161 (1994). Note, however, that the rule of termination-by-counter-offer is not stated as an inflexible one, but as a “default” principle; Restatement (Second) §39(2) indicates that effect should be given to the expressed intention of either offeror or offeree to the contrary.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0321477b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Option contracts</i>. Upon receiving the defendant’s counter-offer, plaintiffs Normile and Kurniawan apparently believed they had “first option” on the property and that Miller had bound herself to sell to no one else until 5:00 <span class="epub-small-caps">p.m.</span> the following day. Simply stated, an option contract involves a promise to keep an offer open, a promise that is binding on the offeror. See Restatement (Second) §25. However, to be binding on the offeror, the promise to keep the offer open must either be supported by “consideration” given by the offeree or have some other basis for enforcement. The <i>Normile</i> court found that the defendant had not made any promise to keep her offer open and thus Normile and Kurniawan for that reason could not have had an option. Moreover, even if Miller’s counter-offer had included an express promise to keep that offer open, Normile and Kurniawan also would have needed to show that they gave “consideration” in exchange for Miller’s promise not to revoke. Instead, Normile and Kurniawan apparently argued that enforcement was appropriate because the counter-offer was made under “seal,” i.e., in a formalized document. The court never reached that question. We will examine those issues in more detail in Chapter 3. For now it is sufficient for us to know that under the modern theory of consideration a promise is generally enforceable only if the promisee has given either a performance or another promise in exchange for it, and that rule would apply to a promise not to revoke an offer.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0321477c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> <i>Possibility of multiple acceptances</i>. In the course of its opinion in <i>Normile,</i> the North Carolina Supreme Court indicated that because the parties “failed to assent to the same thing in the same sense” there was “no meeting of the minds,” and hence no contract. Suppose, however, that the plaintiffs had signed and returned Miller’s counter-offer before they learned from Byer that Miller had in the meantime contracted to sell the property to Segal. It seems at least possible that a binding contract between Miller and the plaintiffs would have been formed at that point. If so, what about the contract between Miller and Segal? Could <i>both</i> contracts have been enforced?</p>
<p id="03216e8d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once it appears that a contract has been formed between two parties, and has been breached by one of them without a legal excuse, the question is then presented: What is the appropriate remedy for that breach? The fact that a contract will be “enforced” by a court does not mean that the court will necessarily order a breaching party to actually carry out the actions that she had promised <span title="59" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-59">p. 59</span>to perform.

<div class="epub-heading left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="03216e8e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56">Comment: Remedies for Breach of Contract</p></div>
<p id="03216e8f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As you are aware, we have chosen to postpone the full discussion of remedies for breach of contract until later, after the formation process and the principal defenses to contract enforcement have been surveyed. On the other hand, we do recognize that even at this early stage of your studies, the most elementary Legal Realism requires some awareness of what is — and what is <i>not</i> — ordinarily entailed in the judicial enforcement of binding contractual obligations.</p>
<p id="03216e90-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The conventional approach to contract enforcement is to award relief that will protect the plaintiff’s “expectation interest”: the <i>net value</i> that the plaintiff expected to realize from due performance of the contract at issue, but which the defendant’s breach has denied her. Computation of this remedy typically involves not only putting some sort of price tag on the value of the performance that the plaintiff failed to receive, but also taking into account any savings which the plaintiff might have realized from withholding any remaining performance of her own. Other “interests,” which contract remedies may also attempt to protect, are the “restitution” and “reliance” interests — the extent to which the defendant has been enriched by, or the plaintiff has been injured by, the plaintiff’s actions in reliance on the defendant’s commitment to perform. (These three remedial interests will be more fully defined and explored in Chapters 10 and 11.)</p>
<p id="03216e91-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The simplest form of relief to protect the plaintiff’s expectation interest would be an award of “specific performance,” ordering the defendant to cooperate with the plaintiff in exchanging performances as originally agreed to. As we shall see, however, such “specific” relief is often unavailable to the plaintiff in a contract action. Sometimes the defendant is simply unable to perform what she promised. We suggested in the Notes above that the defendant in <i>Normile</i> might have found herself bound by two valid contracts to different buyers. Both contracts might have been “enforceable,” but only one buyer could have obtained specific performance; the other would have had to be content with a damage award. Even where actual performance by the defendant is still a practical possibility, specific relief in Anglo-American law is the exception, not the rule. For a combination of reasons — historical, theoretical, and practical — English and American courts traditionally have used as their primary vehicle for contract enforcement the award of money damages, computed if possible so as to give the plaintiff the economic equivalent of her net expectation under the contract. Only in certain situations will the court actually order the defendant to perform what he promised to do.</p>
<p id="03216e92-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In some situations, the court’s award of money damages will be the practical equivalent of specific performance anyway, because payment of money was the defendant’s unperformed obligation under the contract. (An example is Cook v. Coldwell Banker, a case in the next section.) Where the defendant’s <span title="60" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-60">p. 60</span>obligation is something other than the payment of money, however, the court ordinarily will have to put some sort of price tag on the plaintiff’s lost expectation. Thus, if a building contractor breaches a contract with the owner of property to construct a residence, the owner generally will be entitled to recover the difference between the price for which the breaching contractor had agreed to perform the work and the (higher) price that the owner was required to pay another contractor to perform the same work. Ray v. William G. Eurice Bros., Inc., which we considered earlier in this chapter, illustrates this type of expectation damages.</p>
<p id="03216e93-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Chapters 10 and 11 we will address directly some of the theoretical and practical problems involved in awarding remedies for breach of contract. In the meantime, as we continue to move through cases illustrating issues of formation, validation and excuse, keep an eye out for remedies issues as well. In the <i>Lonergan</i> case, for instance, the plaintiff lost because the court resolved the issues of offer and acceptance in favor of defendant Skolnick. Suppose instead that Lonergan had prevailed on those issues, so that Skolnick was indeed liable to Lonergan for wrongful breach of a contract to sell him Skolnick’s property in California. From the information available in the court’s opinion in that case, what remedy might the court have awarded Lonergan?</p>

<div id="03216e94-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="032194a5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56">3.&nbsp;Offer and Acceptance in Unilateral Contracts</p></h3></div>

<p id="032194a6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the preceding section, we focused on the bilateral contract, the typical kind of contract that is formed when the parties exchange promises of future performance. As we will see later in this chapter when we address the concept of “consideration” as an additional requisite for contract formation, an exchange of mutual promises will satisfy that requirement for a binding contract.</p>
<p id="032194a7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But what if one of the parties is not willing to accept merely an assurance of future action, but insists on receiving actual performance before even <i>committing</i> herself to perform in return? In some types of situations, it is common for one party to “offer” (in the sense which we have learned to use that word) to commit herself to some performance if <i>and only if</i> the other party first “accepts” by <i>actually rendering his performance</i>. Classical contract law referred to such a proposal as an “offer for a unilateral contract,” and viewed the offeree’s rendering of the requested performance as serving both as the consideration for the offeror’s promise and as his acceptance of her offer. In such a situation, the offeree may never bind himself by a promise to perform, so he is free not to perform at all (or fail to complete performance), without liability. But once he has completed the performance as requested, the offeror’s commitment is a binding one.</p>
<p id="032194a8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In such a true unilateral-contract case, the offeror is protected against the risk of being obligated to perform without getting anything in return from the offeree. On the other hand, if the offeror is never bound to a contractual commitment until the offeree has completed performing, then the offeree runs a substantial risk — the risk that the offeror will revoke her offer before he has completed performance, leaving him without any remedy for the time and <span title="61" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-61">p. 61</span>effort he has already expended. To remedy this imbalance, contract law over time developed ways of protecting the offeree, by limiting the offeror’s power to withdraw once the offeree had begun performance. (These historical developments are discussed in more detail in the Comment on Development of the Law of Unilateral Contracts, after the <i>Cook</i> case, which follows.) The following cases illustrate the “unilateral contract” device at work.</p>

<p id="0321bbbf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant real estate brokerage firm appeals from a judgment entered on a jury verdict awarding defendant’s former salesperson $24,748.89 as damages for breach of a bonus agreement. Defendant claims that the salesperson failed to make a submissible case in that she did not accept the bonus offer before it was revoked. Defendant also asserts trial court errors relating to instructions, evidence, and closing argument. We affirm.</p>
<p id="0321bbc0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff, Mary Ellen Cook, a licensed real estate agent, worked as a real estate salesperson or agent pursuant to a verbal agreement for defendant Coldwell Banker/Frank Laiben Realty Co. and its predecessors. Plaintiff listed and sold real estate for defendant as an independent contractor. Frank Laiben was a co-owner of defendant.</p>
<p id="0321bbc1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At a sales meeting in March, 1991, defendant, through Laiben, orally announced a bonus program in order to remain competitive with other local brokerage firms and to retain its agents. The bonus program provided that an agent earning $15,000.00 in commissions would receive a $500.00 bonus payable immediately, an agent earning $15,000.00 to $25,000.00 in commissions would receive a twenty-two percent bonus, and an agent earning above $25,000.00 in commissions would receive a thirty percent bonus. Bonuses over the first $500.00 were to be paid at the end of the year. The first year of the program would be January 1, 1991 to December 31, 1991 and it would continue on an annual basis after that. Laiben kept track of the agents’ earnings in a separate bonus account.</p>
<p id="0321bbc2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the end of April, 1991, plaintiff surpassed $15,000.00 in earnings, entitling her to a $500.00 bonus which defendant paid to her in September, 1991. By September, 1991 plaintiff surpassed $32,400.00 in commissions.</p>
<p id="0321e2d3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At another sales meeting in September, 1991, Laiben indicated that bonuses would be paid at a banquet to be held in March of the following year instead of at the end of the year. Plaintiff asked if that meant that an agent had to be “here” in March in order to collect the bonus. Laiben indicated that was what it meant. Plaintiff testified that, at the time of the change in the bonus agreement, she had no intention of leaving defendant, but stayed with defendant until the end of 1991 in reliance on the promise of a bonus.</p>
<p id="0321e2d4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During 1991 plaintiff was contacted about joining Remax, another real estate brokerage firm.

Laiben informed her that she would not be receiving her bonus. At the end of 1991, plaintiff had total earnings of $75,638.47, which made her eligible for a combined bonus of $17,391.54. After placing her license with Remax, plaintiff finished closing four or five contracts that she had been working on prior to leaving defendant. In March, 1992 plaintiff sent a demand letter to defendant, seeking payment for the bonus she believed she had earned. Defendant did not pay plaintiff.</p>
<p id="0321e2d5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On December 17, 1992 plaintiff filed an action against defendant for breach of a bonus contract, seeking damages in the amount of $18,404.31. She amended this petition to include prejudgment interest. At trial Laiben denied that at the March meeting he had stated the bonuses would be paid at the end of the year and testified that at that meeting he had told the agents the bonuses would not be paid until the following March. The jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff and awarded her damages in the amount of $24,748.89. The court entered judgment in this amount.</p>
<p id="0321e2d6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In its first point defendant contends that the trial court erred in overruling its motions for directed verdict because plaintiff failed to make a submissible case of breach of the bonus agreement. In particular, defendant argues that plaintiff did not adduce sufficient evidence to establish a reasonable inference that 1) she tendered consideration to support defendant’s offer of a bonus, or that 2) she accepted defendant’s offer to give a bonus.</p>
<p id="0321e2d7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A directed verdict is a drastic action and should only be granted where reasonable and honest persons could not differ on a correct disposition of the case. Seidel v. Gordon A. Gundaker Real Estate Co., 904 S.W.2d 357, 361 (Mo. App. 1995). In determining whether a plaintiff has made a submissible case in a contract action, we view the evidence in a light most favorable to plaintiff, presume plaintiff’s evidence is true, and give plaintiff the benefit of all reasonable and favorable inferences to be drawn from the evidence. Gateway Exteriors Inc. v. Suntide Homes Inc., 882 S.W.2d 275, 279 (Mo. App. 1994).</p>
<p id="0321e2d8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff adduced evidence of a unilateral contract offered in March, 1991 to pay a bonus under certain conditions at the end of the year. She also adduced evidence that in September, 1991 defendant attempted to revoke that offer and make the bonus contingent upon the agent’s remaining until March of the following year.</p>
<p id="0321e2d9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A unilateral contract is a contract in which performance is based on the wish, will, or pleasure of one of the parties. Klamen v. Genuine Parts Co., 848 S.W.2d 38, 40 (Mo. App. 1993). A promisor does not receive a promise as consideration for his or her promise in a unilateral contract. Id. A unilateral contract lacks consideration for want of mutuality, but when the promisee performs, consideration is supplied, and the contract is enforceable to the extent performed. Leeson v. Etchison, 650 S.W.2d 681, 684 (Mo. App. 1983). An offer to make a unilateral contract is accepted when the requested performance is rendered. Nilsson v. Cherokee Candy &amp; Tobacco Co., 639 S.W.2d 226, 228 (Mo. App. 1982). A promise to pay a bonus in return for an at-will employee’s continued employment is an offer for a unilateral contract <span title="63" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-63">p. 63</span>which becomes enforceable when accepted by the employee’s performance. Id. at 228.</p>
<p id="0321e2da-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the absence of any contract to the contrary, plaintiff could terminate her relationship with defendant at any time and was not obligated to earn a certain level of commissions. There was sufficient evidence that the bonus offer induced plaintiff to remain with defendant through the end of 1991 and to earn a high level of commissions for the court to submit the issue of acceptance by performance to the jury.</p>
<p id="0321e2db-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant next argues that it was free to revoke the first offer with the second offer because, as of the time the second offer was made, plaintiff had not yet accepted the first offer. Defendant maintains that, because plaintiff did not stay until March, 1992, she did not accept the second offer and thus, did not earn the bonus.</p>
<p id="032209ec-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Generally, an offeror may withdraw an offer at any time prior to acceptance unless the offer is supported by consideration. Coffman Industries, Inc. v. Gorman-Taber Co., 521 S.W.2d 763, 772 (Mo. App. 1975). However, an offeror may not revoke an offer where the offeree has made substantial performance. Id. (citing 1 Williston on Contracts, Third Edition Section 60A (1957)). <i>Coffman</i> set out the general rule of law as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="032209ed-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where one party makes a promissory offer in such form that it can be accepted by the rendition of the performance that is requested in exchange, without any express return promise or notice of acceptance in words, the offeror is bound by a contract just as soon as the offeree has rendered a substantial part of that requested performance.</p>

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="032209ef-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The main offer includes a subsidiary promise, necessarily implied, that if part of the requested performance is given, the offeror will not revoke his offer, and that if tender is made it will be accepted. Part performance or tender may thus furnish consideration for the subsidiary promises. Moreover, merely acting in justifiable reliance on an offer may in some cases serve as sufficient reason for making a promise binding. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>

Thus, in the context of an offer for unilateral contract, the offer may not be revoked where the offeree has accepted the offer by substantial performance. Id. at 771-72.</p>
<p id="032209f1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case there was evidence that, before the offer was modified in September, 1991, plaintiff had remained with defendant and had earned over $32,400.00 in commissions, making her eligible for the offered bonus. This constitutes sufficient evidence of substantial performance.</p>
<p id="032209f2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff adduced evidence that defendant offered to pay a bonus at the end of 1991 if she would continue to work for it, that she stayed through 1991 with an intent to accept the offer, that she sold and listed enough property to qualify for all three bonus levels, that defendant knew of plaintiff’s performance, that defendant paid $500.00 of the bonus but did not pay the remainder, and that <span title="64" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-64">p. 64</span>she was damaged.

Restatement (Second) §45 protects the offeree by providing that when the offeror invites acceptance by performance, the beginning of performance creates an “option contract.” While using different conceptual foundations — implied promise versus option contract — the results are the same: the offeror is precluded from revoking the offer once the offeree begins the requested performance. Note that if the offeree fails to complete performance, the offeror would be free to revoke the offer. See Restatement (Second) §45(2).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03223108-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Is substantial performance by the offeree necessary?</i> In <i>Cook</i> the court, relying on earlier case law as well as the writings of Professors Williston and Corbin, indicated that in order to convert the defendant’s offer to an irrevocable one, plaintiff Cook had to have rendered “substantial” performance. Restatement (Second) §45 does not impose this requirement. Should it? Some courts will do so. See, e.g., the <i>Storti</i> case, discussed in Note 4 below.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03225819-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Offeree’s implied promise to complete performance?</i> In Comment <i>d</i> to §45, the drafters of the Restatement (Second) suggest that in many cases the beginning of performance by the offeree “carries with it an express or implied promise [by the offeree] to complete performance,” in which case the offeror also would be protected by a contract, which would be “bilateral” in nature. Could that analysis apply to the facts of the <i>Cook</i> case?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0322581a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Offeror’s explicit reservation of power to revoke.</i> Here, as in most areas of contract law, the party who is aware of the general rules and has adequate counsel may be able to avoid contractual liability. In Storti v. University of Washington, 330 P. 3d 159 (Wash. 2014), the defendant university announced a “merit raise policy” for faculty members who qualified by virtue of their service, then later “suspended” the policy because of major budget cuts stemming from the deep recession. Faculty members sued to enforce their claims for wage increases under the merit raise policy, claiming it had not been suspended until after they had furnished substantial service, creating a unilateral contract enforceable against the university. A similar suspension in an earlier year, followed by a lawsuit, had resulted in liability on the university’s part on an earlier version of the plan. This time, however, the Washington Supreme Court held that even though the plaintiff faculty members had sufficiently performed to create a unilateral contract between themselves and the defendant university with <span title="65" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-65">p. 65</span>respect to the merit raise program (citing Restatement §45), defendant’s suspension of the raise program did not constitute a breach of contract, because the university had by the terms of its plan (together with relevant provisions of its faculty handbook) sufficiently reserved the power to reevaluate the policy in light of changing economic conditions.</p></li>

<div class="epub-heading left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="0322581b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56">Comment: Historical Development of the Law of Unilateral Contracts</p></h3></div>
<p id="0322581c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In its original, “classical” form, an offer for a unilateral contract remained revocable until the offeree <i>completed</i> the act(s) called for in the offer. (The offeree’s performance also constituted the consideration necessary to make the offeror’s promise binding.) This free-revocability rule potentially could result in injustice to an offeree who had begun to perform in reliance on the offeror’s expressed intention to contract, only to have that offer revoked — to have the rug pulled out from under his feet, as it were. Contracts scholars of this period (early twentieth century) typically illustrated the rule through unrealistic hypotheticals: A promises to pay B a sum of money if B walks across the Brooklyn Bridge, and then revokes just before B completes performance. Under the classical approach to contract law, which favored clear rules over considerations of justice, scholars argued in favor of the rule of free revocability and dismissed the offeree’s reliance as “alleged fanciful hardship.” See, e.g., I. Maurice Wormser, The True Conception of Unilateral Contracts, 26 Yale L.J. 136, 136-138 (1916).</p>
<p id="0322581d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The drafters of both the First and Second Restatements of Contracts attempted to ameliorate the harsh results sometimes reached under the classical analysis. In many cases, the words used by the offeror may leave in doubt whether she intends to make only a “true” unilateral-contract offer, or whether the offeree might also accept by making a promise of performance, thus forming a bilateral contract. Section 32 of the Restatement (Second) declares that in such cases of ambiguity, the court should assume that the offeror intended to allow the offeree to have the power to accept <i>either</i> by making a return promise or by rendering the performance requested by the offeror. (Cf. Uniform Commercial Code §2-206(1)(b), to similar effect.) However, section 32 would not protect the offeree when it is clear that the offeror sought an act <i>and only an act</i> in exchange for her promise of performance.</p>
<p id="0322581e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Responding to these concerns, the drafters of both the Restatements also included §45, which now provides that when an offeree tenders or begins the requested performance under a unilateral contract, the offeror cannot revoke her offer so long as the offeree timely completes performance in accordance with the terms of the offer. (The Restatement uses the concept of an “option” contract to reach this result, although the offeror’s promise not to revoke is implied by the law, a “legal fiction.”) We have seen §45 in operation in the <i>Cook</i> case, above.</p>
<p id="0322581f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Writing in 1938, shortly after the promulgation of the first Restatement of Contracts, Professor Karl Llewellyn sharply criticized the common law’s traditional dichotomy between bilateral and unilateral contracts. He argued that in <span title="66" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-66">p. 66</span>the real world “true” unilateral contracts are relatively rare and should not be treated as one-half of the contracting universe. Llewellyn conceded the existence of a few common examples of true offers for unilateral contracts — for example, offers of commissions to real estate brokers (as in the <i>Cook</i> case) and offers of rewards. However, what these offers have in common is not merely that acceptance is made by performance, but the speculative nature of the offeree’s performance; when it is not at all certain that the offeree will be able to perform, <i>even if he wants to</i>, an offeror is unlikely to be interested in a mere promissory acceptance. See Karl Llewellyn, On Our Case-Law of Contract: Offer and Acceptance (Pts. 1 &amp; 2), 48 Yale L.J. 1, 779 (1938-1939), quoted and summarized in Mark Pettit, Jr., Modern Unilateral Contracts, 63 B.U. L. Rev. 551, 552-556 (1983). Influenced by Llewellyn’s argument, the drafters of the Second Restatement abandoned the classical terminological distinction, suggesting that the terms <i>unilateral</i> and <i>bilateral contract</i> generally should be avoided, as “productive of confusion.” See the Reporter’s Note to Restatement (Second) §1, Comment <i>f.</i></p>
<p id="03227f30-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In his 1983 article, cited in the preceding paragraph, Professor Mark Pettit also argued that the obituary for the unilateral contract delivered in Restatement (Second) was premature. Pettit noted that judges have persisted in using the unilateral contract analysis as a basis for decision. (See the <i>Sateriale</i> case that follows.) Having gone full circle from the classical days, however, courts are now using unilateral contract analysis not to avoid liability but to <i>enforce</i> it, by imposing liability on an offeror in cases where no promissory acceptance from the offeree was invited or required. These “new-style” unilateral contracts (Professor Pettit’s phrase) do not involve a performance by the offeree that is inherently speculative; they are simply cases in which the offeree is not necessarily committed to full performance. See Mark Pettit, Jr., Modern Unilateral Contracts, 63 B.U. L. Rev. at 577-583 (discussing employee benefit cases).</p>

<p id="0322a649-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (RJR) operated a customer rewards program, called Camel Cash, from 1991 to 2007. Under the terms of the program, RJR urged consumers to purchase Camel cigarettes, to save Camel Cash certificates included in packages of Camel cigarettes, to enroll in the program and, ultimately, to redeem their certificates for merchandise featured in catalogs distributed by RJR. The plaintiffs allege that, in reliance on RJR’s actions, <span title="67" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-67">p. 67</span>they purchased Camel cigarettes, enrolled in the program and saved their certificates for future redemption. They allege that in 2006 RJR abruptly ceased accepting certificates for redemption, making the plaintiffs’ unredeemed certificates worthless. The plaintiffs brought this action for breach of contract, promissory estoppel and violation of two California consumer protection laws. The district court dismissed the action for failure to state a claim. We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand. We hold that the plaintiffs have adequately alleged claims for breach of contract and promissory estoppel, but affirm dismissal of the plaintiffs’ claims under the Unfair Competition Law and the Consumer Legal Remedies Act.</p>

<p id="03231b90-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“An offer is the manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain, so made as to justify another person in understanding that his assent to that bargain is invited and will conclude it.” <i>Donovan v. RRL Corp.,</i> 26 Cal. 4th 261, 109 Cal. Rptr. 2d 807, 27 P.3d 702, 709 (2001)  . . . . “The determination of whether a particular communication constitutes an operative offer, rather than an inoperative step in the preliminary negotiation of a contract, depends upon all the surrounding circumstances.” <i>Id.</i> “[T]he pertinent inquiry is whether the individual to whom the communication was made had reason to believe that it was intended as an offer.” <i>Id.</i> The issue here is whether the C-Notes, read in isolation or in combination with the catalogs, may have constituted an offer.</p>

<p id="03231b92-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As an initial matter, we are not persuaded that the plaintiffs have alleged the existence of an offer to enter into a <i>bilateral</i> contract. “A bilateral contract consists of mutual promises made in exchange for each other by each of the two contracting parties.” <i>Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Constr., Inc.,</i> 103 Cal. App. 4th 30, 126 Cal. Rptr. 2d 400, 403 (2002) (quoting Corbin on Contracts § 1.23 (rev. ed. 1993)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Both sides of the bargain must have made promises. Here, the plaintiffs have identified an alleged promise by RJR (to allow customers to redeem Camel Cash certificates for rewards), but they have not pointed to any promise they made to RJR. Nor do they argue that RJR sought a return promise in exchange for its own promise to allow consumers to exchange C-Notes for merchandise . . . . The plaintiffs have not alleged that they were bound to do anything. They therefore have not alleged the existence of an offer to enter into a bilateral contract.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1063C_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1063C_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">1</a></span></p>

<p id="03231b95-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We reach a different conclusion as to the plaintiffs’ theory that RJR made an offer to enter into a <i>unilateral</i> contract. In contrast to a bilateral contract, a unilateral contract involves the exchange of a promise for a performance. <i>See Harris <span title="70" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-70">p. 70</span>v. Time, Inc.,</i> 191 Cal. App. 3d 449, 237 Cal. Rptr. 584, 587 (1987). The offer is accepted by rendering a performance rather than providing a promise. <i>See</i> Restatement § 45 cmt. a. “Typical illustrations are found in offers of rewards or prizes . . . .” <i>Id.</i></p>
<p id="03231b96-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">RJR argues that its C-Notes, whether read in isolation or in combination with the catalogs, were not offers, but invitations to make an offer. RJR relies on the common law’s general rule that “[a]dvertisements of goods by display, sign, handbill, newspaper, radio or television are not ordinarily intended or understood as offers to sell.” <i>Id.</i> § 26 cmt. b. RJR emphasizes that two judicial decisions have applied this general rule to customer rewards programs similar to the Camel Cash program, <i>see Leonard v. Pepsico, Inc.,</i> 88 F. Supp. 2d 116, 122-27 (S.D.N.Y. 1999); <i>Alligood v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co.,</i> 72 Ohio App. 3d 309, 594 N.E.2d 668, 668-70 (1991) (per curiam), and urges us to apply the rule here as well. We decline to do so.</p>
<p id="03231b97-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, it is not clear that the common law rule upon which RJR relies applies under California law. <i>See Donovan,</i> 109 Cal. Rptr. 2d 807, 27 P.3d at 710 (stating that “[t]his court has not previously applied the common law rules upon which defendant relies, including the rule that advertisements generally constitute invitations to negotiate rather than offers,” observing that “such rules  . . . have been criticized on the ground that they are inconsistent with the reasonable expectations of consumers and lead to haphazard results,” citing Melvin Aron Eisenberg, <i>Expression Rules in Contract Law and Problems of Offer and Acceptance,</i> 82 Cal. L. Rev. 1127, 1166-72 (1994), and concluding that “[i]n the present case  . . . we need not consider the viability of the black-letter rule regarding the interpretation of advertisements”).</p>
<p id="03231b98-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, even assuming California law incorporates the common law rule, that rule includes an exception for offers of a reward, including offers of a reward for the redemption of coupons.

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03231b99-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is very common, where one desires to induce many people to action, to offer a reward for such action by general publication in some form. A statement that plausibly makes an offer of this kind must be reasonably interpreted according to its terms and the surrounding circumstances. If the statement, properly interpreted, calls for the performance or commencement of performance of specific acts, action in accordance with such an interpretation will close a contract or make the offer irrevocable. There are many cases of an offer of a reward for the capture of a person charged with crime, for desired information, for the return of a lost article, for the winning of a contest, or <i>for the redemption of coupons.</i> In addition, advertisements placed by buyers inviting sellers to ship goods without prior communication are clear cases of offers.

RJR does not discuss this exception, relying instead on <i>Leonard</i> and <i>Alligood.</i> Several courts, however, have applied the exception to customer rewards programs. <i>See, e.g.,  . . . Wolens v.

<p id="032342ac-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Like these courts, we see no justification for applying the general common law rule, rather than the common law exception, to circumstances such as those presented here. The common law rule that advertisements ordinarily do not constitute offers arose to address a specific problem — the potential for over-acceptance — not applicable here.

Otherwise, supposing a shopkeeper were sold out of a particular class of goods, thousands of members of the public might crowd into the shop and demand to be served, and each one would have a right of action against the proprietor for not performing his contract. A customer would not usually have reason to believe that the shopkeeper intended exposure to the risk of a multitude of acceptances resulting in a number of contracts exceeding the shopkeeper’s inventory.</p>
</div>
<p id="032342ae-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">E. Allan Farnsworth, <i>Contracts</i> (hereinafter Farnsworth) § 3.10, at 134 (4th ed. 2004) (footnote and internal quotation marks omitted). This problem arises in the case of ordinary advertisements for the sale of goods or services, but not here. First, RJR’s ostensible purpose in promoting the Camel Cash program was not to sell a limited inventory, but to induce as many consumers as possible to purchase Camel cigarettes. Second, RJR could not have been trapped into a situation in which acceptances exceeded inventory. RJR alone decided how many C-Notes to distribute, so it exercised absolute control over the number of acceptances. As Farnsworth explains, “if the very nature of a proposal restricts its maker’s potential liability to a reasonable number of people, there is no reason why it cannot be an offer.” <i>Id.</i> at 135.</p>
<p id="032342af-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For these reasons, we find no reason to presume that RJR’s communications did not constitute an offer merely because they were addressed to the general public in the form of advertisements. The operative question under California law, therefore, is simply “whether the advertiser, in clear and positive terms, promised to render performance in exchange for something requested by the advertiser, and whether the recipient of the advertisement reasonably might have concluded that by acting in accordance with the request a contract would be formed.” <i>Donovan,</i> 109 Cal. Rptr. 2d 807, 27 P.3d at 710. Construing the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, and drawing all reasonable inferences from the complaint in the plaintiffs’ favor,  . . . we conclude that the plaintiffs have adequately alleged the existence of an offer to enter into a unilateral contract, whereby RJR promised to provide rewards to customers who purchased Camel cigarettes, saved Camel Cash certificates and redeemed their certificates in accordance with the catalogs’ terms.</p>
<p id="032342b0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="72" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-72">p. 72</span>We reach this conclusion in light of the totality of the circumstances surrounding RJR’s communications to consumers: the repeated use of the word “offer” in the C-Notes; the absence of any language disclaiming the intent to be bound; the inclusion of specific restrictions in the C-Notes (“Offer restricted to smokers 21 years of age or older”; “Offer good only in the USA, and void where restricted or prohibited by law”; “Check catalog for expiration date”; “Limit 5 requests for a catalog per household”); the formal enrollment process, through which consumers submitted registration forms and RJR issued enrollment numbers; and the substantial reliance expected from consumers.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN106CC_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N106CC_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">3</a></span> <i>Donovan</i> explains that under the common law “advertisements have been held to constitute offers where they invite the performance of a specific act without further communication and leave nothing for negotiation.” 109 Cal. Rptr. 2d 807, 27 P.3d at 710. These requirements are satisfied here. RJR’s alleged offer invited the performance of specific acts (saving C-Notes and redeeming them for rewards in accordance with the catalog) without further communication, and leaving nothing for negotiation.</p>
<p id="032342b2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">RJR properly emphasizes that the alleged offer left aspects of RJR’s performance to RJR’s discretion. The offer did not specify when future catalogs would be issued, what rewards merchandise they would include, what quantities of merchandise would be available or how many C-Notes would be required to exchange for particular items. The plaintiffs, however, do not allege that these were essential terms. <i>See</i> Compl. ¶ 31 (“[I]t was not a contract to obtain a specific item or good, such as a ‘Joe Camel’ jacket or ashtray.”). Instead, they allege a contract the essence of which was their general right to redeem their Camel Cash certificates, during the life of the program, for whatever rewards merchandise RJR made available, with RJR’s discretion limited only by the implied duty of good faith performance. The presence of discretion thus does not preclude the existence of an offer.</p>
<p id="032342b3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>B.  Definiteness</b></p>
<p id="032342b4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">RJR argues that, even if there was an offer, any contract arising from it would be too indefinite to be enforced. To be enforceable under California law, a contract must be sufficiently definite “for the court to ascertain the parties’ obligations and to determine whether those obligations have been performed or breached.” <i>Bustamante v. Intuit, Inc.,</i> 141 Cal. App. 4th 199, 45 Cal. Rptr. 3d 692, 699 (2006). <span title="73" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-73">p. 73</span> . . . “The terms of a contract are reasonably certain if they provide a basis for determining the existence of a breach and for giving an appropriate remedy.” <i>Id . . . .</i></p>

<p id="032342b6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first of these requirements is satisfied here. The plaintiffs do not claim that they were entitled to particular merchandise, but that RJR was required to make reasonable quantities of rewards merchandise available during the life of the Camel Cash program — a duty RJR allegedly breached by failing to make <i>any</i> merchandise available after October 1, 2006. This alleged breach is readily discernible. <i>See</i> Restatement § 33 cmt. b (“[T]he degree of certainty required may be affected by the dispute which arises and by the remedy sought. Courts decide the disputes before them, not other hypothetical disputes which might have arisen.”).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10706_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10706_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">5</a></span></p>

<p id="032369c9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second requirement “that the contract provide a basis for giving an appropriate remedy” presents a closer question. As noted, RJR exercised considerable discretion in deciding what rewards would be offered. We cannot know precisely what merchandise the plaintiffs might have received had RJR fully performed its obligations, an uncertainty that could inhibit the process of determining a remedy. <i>See Bustamante,</i> 45 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 699 (“[T]he limits of performance must be sufficiently defined to provide a rational basis for the assessment of damages.” . . .).</p>
<p id="032369ca-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is not clear, however, that damages could not be rationally assessed here. RJR’s internal documents assigned C-Notes values, such as 15 cents per $1 note, that might afford a basis for assessing damages. In the alternative, RJR’s final rewards catalog and pre-breach performance might provide a basis for giving an appropriate remedy.</p>
<p id="032369cb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We should not lightly conclude, especially at this early stage in the proceedings, that there is no basis for determining an appropriate remedy where, as here, the allegations suggest that the parties intended to contract . . . . The plaintiffs enrolled in the Camel Cash program, purchased Camel cigarettes and collected Camel Cash certificates. RJR accepted the plaintiffs’ registration forms, issued them enrollment numbers, performed under the program for 15 years and, according to internal RJR documents, treated outstanding C-Notes as a binding obligation and an outstanding financial liability. According to the documents, RJR closely monitored its exposure under the program, and even went so far as to create a financial reserve to cover that exposure — actions consistent with a legally binding commitment.</p>
<p id="032369cc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="74" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-74">p. 74</span>We also consider the plaintiffs’ substantial reliance on RJR’s promises, as well as the substantial benefits RJR accrued by virtue of consumers’ reliance on the Camel Cash program. Corbin explains that, “[i]f one party has greatly benefited by part performance or if one party has relied extensively on the agreement, the court should go to great lengths to find a construction of the agreement that will salvage it.” Corbin § 4.3 (footnotes omitted). For these reasons, dismissal for indefiniteness is unwarranted.</p>
<p id="032369cd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>C. Mutuality of Obligation &amp; Rjr’s Right to Terminate</b></p>
<p id="032369ce-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">RJR argues that the plaintiffs’ contract claim must be dismissed for lack of mutuality of obligation because RJR had an unrestricted right to terminate the Camel Cash program at will, and without notice . . . .</p>
<p id="032369cf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given our conclusion that the plaintiffs have alleged an offer to enter into a unilateral rather than a bilateral contract, RJR’s reliance on mutuality of obligation necessarily fails: that doctrine does not apply to unilateral contracts. <i>See, e.g., Asmus v. Pac. Bell,</i> 23 Cal. 4th 1, 96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 179, 999 P.2d 71, 78 (2000) (“In the unilateral contract context, there is no mutuality of obligation.”). RJR’s argument nonetheless raises important questions about the viability of the plaintiffs’ contract claim. If, in fact, RJR reserved an <i>unrestricted</i> right to terminate the Camel Cash program, <i>without notice,</i> then the plaintiffs’ contract claim may well be untenable.</p>
<p id="032369d0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, a reservation of an unrestricted right to terminate could have precluded RJR’s communications from constituting an offer. As Corbin explains, if an offeror expressly reserves not only the right to revoke the offer at will and without notice, but also the <i>unrestricted right not to perform,</i> then the offer is not legally effective as an offer at all: “A purported offer that reserves the power to withdraw at will even after an acceptance should not be described as an offer at all, but as an invitation to submit an offer.” Corbin § 2.19.</p>
<p id="032369d1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, if RJR reserved an unrestricted right to terminate the Camel Cash program at any time and without notice, then RJR’s promise to perform could be deemed illusory, and hence unenforceable. As Farnsworth explains, when a promise “appears on its face to be so insubstantial as to impose no obligation at all on the promisor — who says, in effect, ‘I will <i>if</i> I want to’ — the promise is not enforceable.” Farnsworth § 2.13, at 75. Accordingly, an enforceable termination clause that gives a promisor an unrestricted power to terminate a contract at any time, without notice, renders the promise illusory and unenforceable, at least so long as the purported contract remains wholly executory.</p>
<p id="032369d2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Either of the foregoing principles could possibly serve to defeat the plaintiffs’ contract claim here. The complaint, however, does not definitively allege that RJR reserved an <i>unrestricted</i> right to terminate its duty to perform. The complaint alleges only that “[c]<i>ertain</i> (but not all) of the Camel Cash catalogs state that Reynolds could terminate the Camel Cash program without notice.” Compl. ¶ 32 (emphasis added). The complaint, moreover, alleges that RJR “waived any right to terminate without notice when, on or about October 1, 2006, it announced by mailing a notice to program members, that the program would terminate as of March 31, 2007.” <i>Id.</i> Dismissal is therefore unwarranted on the current record.</p>

<li class=""><p id="032390ea-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Did the defendant make an “offer” to its customers in the “Camel Cash” campaign?</i> The court in <i>Sateriale</i> considers the “an-ad-is-not-an-offer” position to be the “common law’s general rule.” See note 4 following <i>Lonergan.</i> Courts and writers disagree as to whether that “traditional” rule is in fact still the “majority view.” Professor Farnsworth’s discussion of the rationale behind the traditional rule — protection of sellers from “over acceptance” — quoted by the court, is helpful here; see also the court’s footnote 3.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="032390eb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Is the defendant’s broad discretion consistent with contractual obligation?</i> The court also addresses the wide latitude that the terms of the defendant’s campaign left it in shaping its performance, by invoking the existence of an “implied duty of good faith performance” as potentially curing that problem. See the court’s footnote 5. We will consider in Chapter 6 the general nature of the implied duty of good faith, as found in general contract law and the Uniform Commercial Code. At this point, it is enough for us to note here that this principle can sometimes cure problems of indefiniteness in the contract-making area.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="032390ec-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The concept of “mutuality of obligation.”</i> The court in <i>Sateriale</i> also addresses — but rejects — the argument that because the defendant reserved the freedom to terminate its “Camel Cash” campaign, its relationship with the plaintiffs was necessarily incapable of being a binding contract, because it was lacking in “mutuality of obligation.” This concept can be briefly capsulized as “both parties must be bound or neither will be bound.” While that makes a succinct statement at the “sound-bite” level, it is not at all clear that contract law actually incorporates this principle as a general rule. See the Restatement (Second) §79(c), which apparently views it merely as a corollary of the requirement of consideration; see also Joseph M. Perillo &amp; Helen H. Bender, 2 Corbin on Contracts §6.1, at 197 (Perillo rev. ed. 1995) (“so-called requirement of mutuality of obligation is now widely discredited”). In any event, the court in <i>Sateriale</i> is correct in saying this principle should not apply to the unilateral contract, where one party (the offeree) is generally not bound to continue her performance.</p></li>

A recent example is Kolodziej v. Mason, 774 F.3d 736 (11th Cir. 2014). The defendant, an attorney whose client was on trial for murder, offered publicly — in the course of a television interview — to pay a million dollars to anyone who could prove that his client’s alibi was not an airtight one. The issue was how long it would necessarily have taken for the accused to travel by car and plane to the murder scene, commit the crime and then return, as the prosecution was arguing he had. The defendant asserted this was not a practical possibility, but the plaintiff claimed to have shown it could be done. The lower court granted, and the appellate court upheld, summary judgment to the defendant. In the context, the court held, the plaintiff could not have reasonably understood the statement as an offer. Cf. Leonard v. Pepsico, discussed in Note 6 after the <i>Ray</i> case, above.</p></li>

<p id="0323df20-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The contracts that we have studied so far appeared to be relatively complete, in that the parties presumably negotiated all of the terms regarded as necessary to reach an agreement, even though — as in <i>Sateriale</i> — leaving discretion to one or both parties as to the manner of performing. In many cases, however, a contract may be clearly incomplete — may not contain express terms governing various potentially important aspects of the parties’ relationship. This can be true for a variety of reasons:</p>
<ul class="epub-none">
<li><p id="0323df21-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">– The parties to a contract may not realize that they hold different understandings about the unaddressed terms;</p></li>
<li><p id="0323df22-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">– The costs of continued bargaining (in time, money, and the risk of losing the deal) may not appear justifiable in light of the relative infrequency with which disputes involving such omitted matters actually arise;</p></li>
<li><p id="03240633-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">– A party’s failure to pursue the bargaining farther may stem from her belief that if a dispute involving a particular type of unresolved issue were in fact to arise, she would prevail anyway, under terms that the law would imply;</p></li>
<li><span title="78" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-78">p. 78</span><p id="03240634-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">– Finally, the parties themselves may by agreement have explicitly designated certain matters for postponed decision-making — for agreement at some future time.</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="03240635-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite all these practical reasons why parties may create seemingly incomplete bargains, they posed serious legal problems under the classical system, as indicated by the following excerpt from Professor Corbin’s treatise:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03240636-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Communications that include mutual expressions of agreement may fail to consummate a contract for the reason that they are not complete, some essential term not having been included. Frequently agreements are arrived at piecemeal, different terms and items being discussed and agreed upon separately. As long as the parties know that there is an essential term not yet agreed on, there is no contract; the preliminary agreements on specific items are mere preliminary negotiation building up the terms of the final offer that may or may not be made. Even though one of the parties may believe that the negotiation has been concluded, all items agreed upon, and the contract closed, there is still no contract unless he is reasonable in his belief and the other party ought to have known that he would so believe . . . .</p>
<p id="03240637-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Further illustrations are to be found in the cases of a so-called contract to make a contract. It is quite possible for parties to make an enforceable contract binding them to prepare and execute a subsequent documentary agreement. In order that such may be the effect, it is necessary that agreement shall have been expressed on all essential terms that are to be incorporated in the document. That document is understood to be a mere memorial of the agreement already reached. If the document or contract that the parties agree to make is to contain any material term that is not already agreed on, no contract has yet been made; and the so-called “contract to make a contract” is not a contract at all.</p>

<p id="03242d4f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this declaratory judgment proceeding the plaintiff appellee sought an adjudication that he had effectively exercised an option to extend a lease, and a further determination of the amount of rent to be paid. The relief prayed was granted by the Chancellor. The principal issue is whether the option provision in the lease fixed the rent with sufficient certainty to constitute an enforceable contract between the parties.</p>
<p id="03242d50-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="79" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-79">p. 79</span>In July 1951 appellants, the lessors, leased a small lot to appellee, the lessee, for a 10-year term at a rent of $100 per month. The lessee was given an option to extend the lease for an additional 10-year term, under the same terms and conditions except as to rental. The renewal option provided: “rental will be fixed in such amount as shall actually be agreed upon by the lessors and the lessee with the monthly rental fixed on the comparative basis of rental values as of the date of the renewal with rental values at this time reflected by the comparative business conditions of the two periods.”</p>
<p id="03242d51-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The lessee gave the proper notice to renew but the parties were unable to agree upon the rent. Preliminary court proceedings finally culminated in this lawsuit. Based upon the verdict of an advisory jury, the Chancellor fixed the new rent at $125 per month.</p>
<p id="03242d52-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question before us is whether the quoted provision is so indefinite and uncertain that the parties cannot be held to have agreed upon this essential rental term of the lease. There have been many cases from other jurisdictions passing on somewhat similar lease provisions and the decisions are in hopeless conflict. We have no authoritative Kentucky decision.</p>
<p id="03242d53-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the outset two observations may be made. One is that rental in the ordinary lease is a very uncomplicated item. It involves the number of dollars the lessee will pay. It, or a method of ascertaining it, can be so easily fixed with certainty. From the standpoint of stability in business transactions, it should be so fixed.</p>
<p id="03242d54-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Secondly, as an original proposition, uncomplicated by subtle rules of law, the provision we have quoted, on its face, is ambiguous and indefinite. The language used is equivocal. It neither fixes the rent not furnishes a positive key to its establishment. The terminology is not only confusing but inherently unworkable as a formula.</p>
<p id="03242d55-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The above observations should resolve the issue. Unfortunately it is not that simple. Many courts have become intrigued with the possible import of similar language and have interpolated into it a binding obligation. The lease renewal option has been treated as something different from an ordinary contract. The law has become woefully complicated. For this reason we consider it necessary and proper to examine this question in depth.</p>
<p id="03242d56-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The following basic principles of law are generally accepted:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03245467-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is a necessary requirement in the nature of things that an agreement in order to be binding must be sufficiently definite to enable a court to give it an exact meaning. Williston on Contracts (3d ed.) Vol. 1, section 37 (page 107).</p>
<p id="03245468-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Like other contracts or agreements for a lease, the provision for a renewal must be certain in order to render it binding and enforceable. Indefiniteness, vagueness, and uncertainty in the terms of such a provision will render it void unless the parties, by their subsequent conduct or acts supplement the covenant and thus remove an alleged uncertainty. The certainty that is required is such as will enable a court to determine what has been agreed upon. 32 Am. Jur., Landlord and Tenant, section 958 (page 806).</p>
<p id="03245469-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The terms of an extension or renewal, under an option therefor in a lease, may be left for future determination by a prescribed method, as by future <span title="80" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-80">p. 80</span>arbitration or appraisal; but merely leaving the terms for future ascertainment, without providing a method for their determination, renders the agreement unenforceable for uncertainty. 51 C.J.S. Landlord and Tenant 56b (2), page 597.</p>
<p id="0324546a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A renewal covenant in a lease which leaves the renewal rental to be fixed by future agreement between the parties has generally been held unenforceable and void for uncertainty and indefiniteness. Also, as a general rule, provisions for renewal rental dependent upon future valuation of premises without indicating when or how such valuation should be made have been held void for uncertainty and indefiniteness. 32 Am. Jur., Landlord and Tenant, section 965 (page 810).</p>
</div>
<p id="0324546b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many decisions supporting these principles may be found in 30 A.L.R. 572; 68 A.L.R. 157; 166 A.L.R. 1237.</p>
<p id="0324546c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The degree of certainty is the controlling consideration. An example of an appropriate method by which a non-fixed rental could be determined appears in Jackson v. Pepper Gasoline Co., 280 Ky. 226, 133 S.W.2d 91, 126 A.L.R. 1370. The lessee, who operated an automobile service station, agreed to pay “an amount equal to one cent per gallon of gasoline delivered to said station.” Observing that the parties had created <i>a definite objective standard</i> by which the rent could with certainty be <i>computed,</i> the court upheld the lease as against the contention that it was lacking in mutuality. (The Chancellor cited this case as authoritative on the issue before us, but we do not believe it is. Appellee apparently agrees because he does not even cite the case in his brief.)</p>
<p id="0324546d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the face of the rent provision, the parties had not agreed upon a rent figure. They left the amount to future determination. If they had agreed upon a specific method of making the determination, such as by computation, the application of a formula, or the decision of an arbitrator, they could be said to have agreed upon whatever rent figure emerged from utilization of the method. This was not done.</p>
<p id="0324546e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It will be observed the rent provision expresses two ideas. The first is that the parties agree to agree. The second is that the future agreement will be based on a comparative adjustment in the light of “business conditions.” We will examine separately these two concepts and then consider them as a whole.</p>
<p id="0324546f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The lease purports to fix the rent at such an amount as shall “actually be agreed upon.” It should be obvious that an agreement to agree cannot constitute a binding contract.

Weatherford, 32 Ariz. 370, 259 P. 282, 56 A.L.R. 903; Rainwater v. Hobeika, 208 S.C. 433, 38 S.E.2d 495, 166 A.L.R. 1228. We have examined the reasons set forth in those opinions and do not find them convincing. The view is taken that the renewal option is for the benefit of the lessee; that the parties intended something; and that the lessee should not be deprived of his right to enforce his contract. This reasoning seems to overlook the fact that a party must have an enforceable contract before he has a right to enforce it. We wonder if these courts would enforce an <i>original</i> lease in which the rent was not fixed, but agreed to be agreed upon.</p>
<p id="03247b85-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Surely there are some limits to what equity can or should undertake to compel parties in their private affairs to do what the court thinks they should have done. See Slayter v. Pasley, Or., 199 Or. 616, 264 P.2d 444, 449; and dissenting opinion of Judge Weygandt in Moss v. Olson, 148 Ohio 625, 76 N.E.2d 875. In any event, we are not persuaded that renewal options in leases are of such an exceptional character as to justify emasculation of one of the basic rules of contract law. An agreement to agree simply does not fix an enforceable obligation.</p>
<p id="03247b86-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As noted, however, the language of the renewal option incorporated a secondary stipulation. Reference was made to “comparative business conditions” which were to play some part in adjusting the new rental. It is contended this provides the necessary certainty, and we will examine a leading case which lends support to the argument.</p>
<p id="03247b87-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Edwards v. Tobin, 132 Or. 38, 284 P. 562, 68 A.L.R. 152, the court upheld and enforced a lease agreement which provided that the rent should be “determined” at the time of renewal, “said rental to be <i>a reasonable rental</i> under the then existing conditions.” (Our emphasis.) Significance was attached to the last quoted language, the court reasoning that since the parties had agreed upon a reasonable rent, the court would hold the parties to the agreement by fixing it.</p>
<p id="03247b88-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All rents tend to be reasonable. When parties are trying to reach an agreement, however, their ideas or claims of reasonableness may widely differ. In addition, they have a right to bargain. They cannot be said to be in <i>agreement</i> about what is a reasonable rent until they specify a figure or an exact method of determining it. The term “reasonable rent” is itself indefinite and uncertain. Would an original lease for a “reasonable rent” be enforceable by either party? The very purpose of a rental stipulation is to remove this item from an abstract area.</p>
<p id="03247b89-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is true courts often must <i>imply</i> such terms in a contract as “reasonable time” or “reasonable price.” This is done when the parties fail to deal with such matters in an otherwise enforceable contract. Here the parties were undertaking <span title="82" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-82">p. 82</span>to fix the terms rather than leave them to implication. Our problem is not what the law would imply if the contract did not purport to cover the subject matter, but whether the parties, in removing this material term from the field of implication, have fixed their mutual obligations.</p>
<p id="03247b8a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are seeking what the agreement actually was. When dealing with such a specific item as rent, to be payable in dollars, the area of possible agreement is quite limited. If the parties did not agree upon such an unequivocal item or upon a definite method of ascertaining it, then there is a clear case of nonagreement. The court, in fixing an obligation under a non-agreement, is not enforcing the contract but is binding the parties to something they were patently unable to agree to when writing the contract.</p>
<p id="03247b8b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The opinion in the <i>Tobin</i> case, which purportedly was justifying the enforcement of a contractual obligation between the lessor and lessee, shows on its face the court was doing something entirely different. This question was posed in the opinion: “What logical reason is there for equity to refuse to act when the parties themselves <i>fail to agree</i> on the rental?” (Our emphasis.) The obvious logical answer is that even equity cannot enforce as a contract a nonagreement. No distortion of words can hide the fact that when the court admits the parties “fail to agree,” then the contract it enforces is one it makes for the parties.</p>
<p id="03247b8c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It has been suggested that rent is not a material term of a lease. It is said in the <i>Tobin</i> case: “The method of determining the rent pertains more to form than to substance. It was not the essence of the contract, but was merely incidental and ancillary thereto.” This seems rather startling. Nothing could be more vital in a lease than the amount of rent. It is the price the lessee agrees to pay and the lessor agrees to accept for the use of the premises. Would a contract to buy a building at a “reasonable price” be enforceable? Would the method of determining the price be a matter of “form” and “incidental and ancillary” to the transaction? In truth it lies at the heart of it. This seems to us as no more than a grammatical means of sweeping the problem under the rug. It will not do to say that the establishment of the rent agreed upon is not of the essence of a lease contract . . . .</p>
<p id="0324a29d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not think our problem can be solved by determining which is the “majority” rule and which is the “minority” rule. We are inclined, however, to adhere to a sound basic principle of contract law unless there are impelling reasons to depart from it, particularly so when the practical problems involved in such departure are so manifest. Let us briefly examine those practical problems.</p>
<p id="0324a29e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What the law requires is an adequate key to a mutual agreement. If “comparative business conditions” afforded sufficient certainty, we might possibly surmount the obstacle of the unenforceable agreement to agree. This term, however, is very broad indeed. Did the parties have in mind local conditions, national conditions, or conditions affecting the lessee’s particular business?</p>
<p id="0324a29f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That a controversy, rather than a mutual agreement, exists on this very question is established in this case. One of the substantial issues on appeal is whether the Chancellor properly admitted in evidence the consumer price index of the United States Labor Department. At the trial the lessor was attempting to prove the change in local conditions and the lessee sought to prove changes <span title="83" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-83">p. 83</span>in national conditions. Their minds to this day have never met on a criterion to determine the rent. It is pure fiction to say the court, in deciding upon some figure, is enforcing something the parties agreed to.</p>
<p id="0324a2a0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One aspect of this problem seems to have been overlooked by courts which have extended themselves to fix the rent and enforce the contract. This is the Statute of Frauds. The purpose of requiring a writing to evidence an agreement is to assure certainty of the essential terms thereof and to avoid controversy and litigation. See 49 Am. Jur., Statute of Frauds, section 313 (page 629); section 353 (page 663); section 354 (page 664). This very case is living proof of the difficulties encountered when a court undertakes to supply a missing essential term of a contract.</p>
<p id="0324a2a1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the first place, when the parties failed to enter into a new agreement as the renewal option provided, their rights were no longer <i>fixed</i> by the contract. The determination of what they were was automatically shifted to the courtroom. There the court must determine the scope of relevant evidence to establish that certainty which obviously cannot be culled from the contract. Thereupon extensive proof must be taken concerning business conditions, valuations of property, and reasonable rentals. Serious controversies develop concerning the admissibility of evidence on the issue of whether “business conditions” referred to in the lease are those on the local or national level, or are those particularly affecting the lessee’s business. An advisory jury is impaneled to express its opinion as to the proper rental figure. The judge then must decide whether the jury verdict conforms to the proof and to his concept of equity. On appeal the appellate court must examine alleged errors in the trial. Assuming some error in the trial (which appears likely on this record), the case may be reversed and the whole process begun anew. All of this time we are piously clinging to a concept that the contract itself fixed the rent with some degree of certainty.</p>
<p id="0324a2a2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We realize that litigation is oft times inevitable and courts should not shrink from the solution of difficult problems. On the other hand, courts should not expend their powers to establish contract rights which the parties, with an opportunity to do so, have failed to define. As said in Morrison v. Rossingnol, 5 Cal. 64, quoted in 30 A.L.R. at page 579:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="0324a2a3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A court of equity is always chary of its power to decree specific performance, and will withhold the exercise of its jurisdiction in that respect, unless there is such a degree of certainty in the terms of the contract as will enable it at one view to do complete equity.</p>
</div>
<p id="0324a2a4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That cannot be done in this case.</p>
<p id="0324a2a5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Stipulations such as the one before us have been the source of interminable litigation. Courts are called upon not to enforce an agreement or to determine what the agreement was, but to write their own concept of what would constitute a proper one. Why this paternalistic task should be undertaken is difficult to understand when the parties could so easily provide any number of workable methods by which rents could be adjusted. As a practical matter, courts sometimes must assert their right not to be imposed upon. This thought was thus summed up in Slayter v. Pasley, Or., 264 P.2d 444, page 449:<span title="84" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-84">p. 84</span></p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="0324a2a6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We should be hesitant about completing an apparently legally incomplete agreement made between persons sui juris enjoying freedom of contract and dealing at arms’ length by arbitrarily interpolating into it our concept of the parties’ intent merely to validate what would otherwise be an invalid instrument, lest we inadvertently commit them to an ostensible agreement which, in fact, is contrary to the deliberate design of all of them. It is a dangerous doctrine when examined in the light of reason. Judicial paternalism of this character should be as obnoxious to courts as is legislation by judicial fiat. Both import a quality of jural ego and superiority not consonant with long-accepted ideas of legistic propriety under a democratic form of government. If, however, we follow the urgings of the lessee in the instant matter, we will thereby establish a precedent which will open the door to repeated opportunities to do that which, in principle, courts should not do and, in any event, are not adequately equipped to do.</p>
</div>
<p id="0324a2a7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think the basic principle of contract law that requires substantial certainty as to the material terms upon which the minds of the parties have met is a sound one and should be adhered to. A renewal option stands on the same footing as any other contract right. Rent is a material term of a lease. If the parties do not fix it with reasonable certainty, it is not the business of courts to do so.</p>
<p id="0324c9b8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The renewal provision before us was fatally defective in failing to specify either an agreed rental or an agreed method by which it could be fixed with certainty. Because of the lack of agreement, the lessee’s option right was illusory. The Chancellor erred in undertaking to enforce it.</p>
<p id="0324c9b9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judgment is reversed.</p>

<li class=""><p id="0324c9bc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Factors favoring the tenant.</i> It seems clear that the court that decided Walker v. Keith could, if it wished, have determined a “reasonable” rental for the renewal term and upheld the plaintiff tenant’s right to renew on that basis (or simply affirmed the decision of the lower court, which appears to have done just that). What factors impelled its refusal to do so? In the course of its opinion, the <i>Walker</i> court concedes that other courts have enforced lease-extension agreements substantially similar to the one at issue in <i>Walker,</i> despite the incompleteness of the parties’ agreement (“decisions are in hopeless conflict”). What considerations might lead a court to decide such a case in favor of enforcement? Should those factors have outweighed the ones that apparently actuated the court in <i>Walker?</i> In Cassinari v. Mapes, 542 P.2d 1069 (Nev. 1975), the plaintiff tenant sought damages for wrongful eviction from the premises on which he operated a restaurant business. The renewal option provision that the plaintiff sought to enforce stated that the five-year renewal term should be on “the same terms and conditions” as the original term, but “at a monthly rental to be determined” at the time of renewal. The court upheld the tenant’s claim, on the following reasoning:</p>
<span title="85" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-85">p. 85</span>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="0324c9bd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is appropriate to enforce such a provision since the clause for renewal constitutes part of the consideration for the original lease, and was without question intended by the parties to have meaning and to be effective. Surely we may not presume that one of the signatories agreed to the provision only in the secret belief that it would prove unenforceable. It is proper, then, to imply that the parties intended a reasonable rent for the extended period. If [they are] unable to agree, a court should be allowed to fix the rental since economic conditions are ascertainable with sufficient certainty to make the clause capable of enforcement. This view, we think, carries out the true intention of the parties, and does not constitute a making of a lease by the court in opposition to the desire of lessor and lessee.</p>
</div>
<p id="0324c9be-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Id. at 1071. Is this argument persuasive, given the facts of <i>Cassinari</i>? Would it be equally applicable to the <i>Walker</i> case? Why did the defendant landlord refuse to renew Walker’s lease, and why did Walker care enough to attempt to legally enforce it? Although <i>Walker</i> is a mid-twentieth-century decision, its indifference to context and to potential equitable factors seems as “classical” as anything from the heyday of Langdell and Williston.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0324c9bf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Other decisions.</i> A number of courts have enforced lease-renewal option agreements despite the failure of the parties to agree on a rental figure in advance. See, e.g., Berrey v. Jeffcoat, 785 P.2d 20 (Alaska 1990) (“rent shall be renegotiated and determined according to existing conditions and cost of living increases as of that time”); Little Caesar Enterprises, Inc., v. Bell Canyon Shopping Center, L.C., 13 P.3d 600 (Utah 2000) (“When a bargained-for term of a renewal provision sets a range within which negotiations for a rental rate must take place, the lessor may not render the renewal provision unenforceable simply by refusing to negotiate within the specified range and insisting on rent exceeding the maximum allowed by the contract.”). Other courts have disagreed, however, and take the same position as the court in <i>Walker.</i> See, e.g., Joseph Martin, Jr., Delicatessen, Inc. v. Schumacher, 417 N.E.2d 541, 544 (N.Y. 1981) (“annual rentals to be agreed upon”); Steffen v. Dumke, 2008 WL 2120012 (Wis. Ct. App.) (price “shall be negotiated” at time of renewal).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0324f0d0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Open price term agreements under the UCC.</i> Although <i>Walker</i> and the other cases cited in the Notes above involved leases, the common law generally has been resistant to the notion that an enforceable contract could result from an agreement in which the parties failed to agree on either a specific price or at least a method (specific formula, designated arbitrator, extrinsic market source, etc.) by which price could be ascertained. On this point, the Uniform Commercial Code takes a diametrically opposite position. Section 2-305 provides that an “open price term” will not necessarily prevent enforcement of a contract for the sale of goods. Whether the parties leave price for their later mutual determination or agree in advance that one of them shall have the power to fix a price, the court in either case may enforce the contract if it finds that the parties intended to be bound by their agreement. In that event, if the parties later fail to agree on price, the court may enforce a “reasonable price”; if one party has the power to fix price, he must do so “in good faith.”</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0324f0d1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="86" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-86">p. 86</span><i>Open price term agreements outside the UCC.</i> If UCC §2-305 makes sense in the context of Article 2, should the courts apply similar principles to “open price” contracts of other types? The Restatement (Second) in Comment <i>e</i> to §33 appears to endorse the notion that the principle of UCC §2-305 could be applied to contracts other than the sale of goods (although suggesting that the remedy might be limited to protection of the reliance or restitution interests). For example, in Arbitron, Inc. v. Tralyn Broadcasting, Inc., 400 F.3d 130 (2d Cir. 2005), the Second Circuit distinguished earlier New York cases, including <i>Joseph Martin</i>, cited in Note 2 above, and held that an escalation clause in a licensing agreement that allowed the licensor to adjust the monthly fee if the licensee acquired additional radio stations was not impermissibly vague even though it did not contain a definite price. The court held that the clause was not an unenforceable “agreement to agree,” but instead allowed the licensor to set the price when stated conditions arose.</p></li>

Quake received an invitation to bid on the employee facilities and automotive maintenance shop project (hereinafter referred to as the project), and in April 1985 submitted its bid to Jones. Jones orally notified Quake that Quake had been awarded the contract for the project. Jones then asked Quake to provide the license numbers of the subcontractors Quake intended to use on the project.

Jones informed Quake that Quake would shortly receive a written contract for the project prepared by Jones.

The damages Quake allegedly suffered included the money it spent in procuring the contract and preparing to perform under the contract, and its loss of anticipated profit from the contract.</p>
<p id="03253f05-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The main issue is whether the letter of intent from Jones to Quake is an enforceable contract such that a cause of action may be brought by Quake. This court has previously set forth the principles of law concerning the enforceability of letters of intent:</p>

If the terms of an alleged contract are ambiguous or capable of more than one interpretation, however, parol evidence is admissible to ascertain the parties’ intent. (Borg-Warner Corp. v.

<p id="03253f0b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The circuit court in the case at bar dismissed Quake’s complaint, relying principally on the following sentence in the letter: “Jones Brothers Construction Corporation reserves the right to cancel this letter of intent if the parties cannot agree on a fully executed subcontract agreement” (hereinafter referred to as the cancellation clause) . . . . The circuit court determined, based on the cancellation clause, that the parties agreed not to be bound until they entered into a formal written contract. Consequently, the circuit court held that the letter was not an enforceable contract and accordingly dismissed the complaint.</p>

<p id="0325661d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree with the appellate court majority’s analysis and its conclusion that the letter was ambiguous. Consequently, we affirm the decision of the appellate court. The letter of intent included detailed terms of the parties’ agreement. The letter stated that Jones awarded the contract for the project to Quake. The letter stated further “this notice of award authorizes the work.” Moreover, the letter indicated the work was to commence approximately 4 to 11 days after the letter was written. This short period of time reveals the parties’ intent to be bound by the letter so the work could begin on schedule. We also agree with the appellate court that the cancellation clause exhibited the parties’ intent to be bound by the letter because no need would exist to provide for the cancellation of the letter unless the letter had some binding effect. The cancellation clause also implied the parties’ intention to be bound by the letter at least until they entered into the formal contract. We agree with the appellate court that all of these factors evinced the parties’ intent to be bound by the letter.</p>
<p id="0325661e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, the letter referred several times to the execution of a formal contract by the parties, thus indicating the parties’ intent not to be bound by the letter. The cancellation clause could be interpreted to mean that the parties did not intend to be bound until they entered into a formal agreement. Therefore, the appellate court correctly concluded that the letter was ambiguous regarding the parties’ intent to be bound by it.</p>
<p id="0325661f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants contend the letter of intent did not contain all of the terms necessary for the formation of a construction contract. Defendants assert construction contracts typically include terms regarding payment, damages and termination. Defendants argue the detail in the contract is usually extensive if the value and complexity of the construction project are great. Defendants also note the letter stated the contract would include the detailed terms and conditions of the parties’ agreement. The letter indicated the contract would include the MBE, WBE and EEO (Minority Business Enterprise, Women’s Business Enterprise, and Equal Employment Opportunity, respectively) goals established by Quake’s bid proposal. Defendants point out the letter stated certain terms of the agreement still had to be negotiated. Without the formal contract, defendants assert, the parties could not have continued toward the completion of the project because the letter excluded many terms of the agreement which would have been included in the contract. Defendants thus argue the absence in the letter of all the terms of the agreement reveals the parties’ intent not to be bound by the letter.</p>
<p id="03256620-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The appellate court stated the number and extent of the terms in the letter can indicate the parties’ intent to be bound by the letter. The final contract only need be substantially based on the terms in the letter as long as the parties intended the letter to be binding. (Chicago, 107 Ill. 2d at 126-27, 89 Ill. Dec. 869, 481 N.E.2d 712.) Many of the details regarding the project were included in the letter. The letter adopted by reference the contents of certain documents which included even further details concerning the project. We agree Jones accepted the MBE, WBE and EEO goals established by Quake. The letter merely indicated that those goals would be reiterated in the contract. We acknowledge that the <span title="90" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-90">p. 90</span>absence of certain terms in the letter indicates the parties’ intent not to be bound by the letter.

<p id="03256622-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants contend even if the letter contained all of the essential terms of a contract, the cancellation clause negated any inference that the parties intended to be bound by the letter. The clause, according to defendants, clearly established the parties’ intent not to be so bound . . . .</p>
<p id="03256623-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not find defendants’ argument persuasive. The appellate court stated that, in addition to the detailed terms of the parties’ agreement, the letter also contained a sentence in which Jones said it awarded the contract for the project to Quake. Moreover, the letter stated “this notice of award <i>authorizes</i> the work.” (Emphasis added.) Furthermore, the appellate court pointed out, the letter was dated April 18, while at the same time the letter indicated that Quake was to begin work the week of April 22 and complete the work by August 15. We agree with the appellate court’s conclusion that a “reasonable inference from these facts is that the parties intended that work on the Project would begin prior to execution of a formal contract and would be governed by the terms of the ‘Letter of Intent.’ ” (181 Ill. App. 3d at 914, 130 Ill. Dec. 534, 537 N.E.2d 863.) All of these factors indicate the negotiations were more than merely preliminary and the parties intended the letter to be binding. The factors muddle whatever otherwise “clear” intent may be derived from the cancellation clause.</p>
<p id="03256624-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants acknowledge the letter was dated April 18 and it stated the work would commence the week of April 22. Defendants point out that the letter also indicated Jones would submit a formal contract to Quake “shortly.” Defendants argue a contract could conceivably have been written and signed within that period of time. Defendants conclude the appellate court’s assumption regarding the date of the letter and the commencement of the work was invalid. While defendants’ interpretation of these facts is plausible, we believe it only lends credence to our conclusion the letter is ambiguous concerning the parties’ intent. Thus, the trier of fact should decide which interpretation is valid.</p>
<p id="03256625-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . .</p>
<p id="03256626-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants further contend that the cancellation clause is not ambiguous. Defendants assert parties may agree, in a letter of intent, to the course of, and discontinuance of, their negotiations. Defendants argue the letter of intent in the case at bar merely reflects the parties’ agreement regarding the course of their negotiations.</p>
<p id="03256627-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We, like the appellate court, find the cancellation clause itself ambiguous as to the parties’ intent. We do not agree with defendants’ assertion that the cancellation clause so clearly indicates the parties’ intent not to be bound by the letter that the clause negates other evidence in the letter of the parties’ intent to be bound. The clause can be construed as a condition precedent to the formation of a contract. The clause, however, also states that Jones can “cancel” the letter. As the appellate court noted, if the parties did not intend to be bound by the letter, they had no need to provide for its cancellation. We also agree with the appellate court that the cancellation clause “implies that the parties could <span title="91" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-91">p. 91</span>be bound by the ‘Letter of Intent’ in the absence of a fully executed subcontract agreement.” (181 Ill. App. 3d at 914, 130 Ill. Dec. 534, 537 N.E.2d 863.) Thus, the ambiguity within the cancellation clause itself enhances the other ambiguities in the letter.</p>

Defendants contend if we uphold the appellate court’s decision finding the cancellation clause ambiguous, negotiating parties will have difficulty finding limiting language which a court would unquestionably consider unambiguous. We disagree. Courts have found letters of intent unambiguous in several cases referred to in this opinion . . . . Thus, the existence or absence of particular language or words will not ensure that a letter of intent is unambiguous. Our decision here follows the settled law in Illinois concerning letters of intent: The intent of the parties is controlling.</p>
<p id="03258d3a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Neither we nor the appellate court have decided whether in fact a contract exists, that is, whether the parties intended to be bound by the letter. We merely hold that the parties’ intent, based on the letter alone, is ambiguous. Therefore, upon remand, the circuit court must allow the parties to present other evidence of their intent. The trier of fact should then determine, based on the evidence and the letter, whether the parties intended to be bound by the letter.</p>

<p id="0325b352-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The cancellation clause refers expressly to cancelling the <i>letter,</i> not to cancelling the construction contract that the letter anticipates. A construction contract certainly would bind the parties to that contract’s terms, but upon acceptance by Quake the letter here would much more plausibly be viewed as, at most, only binding the parties to efforts at achieving a construction contract on the terms outlined. See, e.g., Evans, Inc. v. Tiffany &amp; Co. (N.D. Ill. 1976), 416 F. Supp. 224 (obligation to negotiate derived from unclear letter of intent); see also Farnsworth, Precontractual Liability, 87 Colum. L.

Indeed, the notion of cancelling a construction contract not yet entered into lacks meaning.</p>

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="0325b359-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the letter can be regarded as creating an obligation on Jones to attempt to achieve a construction contract, existence of the clause might be explained as a device by which Jones could put an end to its obligation to negotiate.</p>
<p id="0325b35a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The fact that this letter, like many others, was intended to induce action by third parties furnishes another possible explanation for including the cancellation clause: It would give Jones a way to put an end to any further inducement based on Jones’ once-expressed intention.</p>
<p id="0325b35b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A third possible explanation lies in the possibility that, as a result of the parties’ subsequent conduct (such as commencement of construction work by Quake), an uncancelled letter of intent might become a link in a chain leading to a finding of contract.</p>

<p id="0325da6d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Any or all of these possibilities would adequately explain the clause, without any need whatever to conclude that the clause betokens an intent to be bound to a construction contract thought to be embodied in the letter.

<p id="0325da6e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If letters of intent are to be used, their drafters would be well advised to avoid ambiguity on the point of whether the issuers are bound. As ever, obscurantist language can produce desired practical effects in the short term, but can well lead eventually to litigation and undesired contractual obligations. Extreme examples exist.

Assuming that you represented Jones in the original negotiations, and foresaw the possibility of such a dispute as this, how could you have drafted the letter of intent to avoid the ambiguity found by the court and to protect your client’s interests? Do you think Quake would have agreed to your version? Why or why not?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0325da73-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Incomplete bargains: intention to be bound.</i> Analytically, it is useful to contrast different situations of incomplete bargaining. In one type of case, the “agreement to agree,” the parties have reached accord on a number of important matters but have left one or more terms for future agreement (Walker v. Keith, the landlord-tenant dispute, was this type of case.) In the second situation, the “formal contract contemplated,” the parties have reached agreement in principle on at least the major provisions of their agreement, but they contemplate the later execution of a formal written contract. See, e.g., Cochran v. Norkunas, 919 A.2d 700 (Md. 2007) (despite letter of intent, parties did not intend to be bound until standard form realty contract was executed). It is, of course, possible that a fact pattern could involve both of these — be an agreement to agree and also a formal-contract-contemplated case. For example, the parties might reach agreement on all material terms of their contract, except for delivery dates, which would expressly be left for future agreement; they could then express their agreement in principle in a brief letter of intent which contemplates the later execution of a more formal contract. Is <i>Quake</i> an example of an “agreement to agree”? A “formal contract contemplated”? Perhaps both?</p>
<p id="0325da74-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both the UCC and the Restatement recognize that parties may be bound contractually when they have reached agreement in principle, even though they contemplate either further negotiations on particular points (“agreement to agree”) or the execution of a formal written contract (“formal contract contemplated”). UCC §2-204(3) states: “Even if one or more terms are left open a contract for sale does not fail for indefiniteness if the parties have intended to make a contract and there is a reasonably certain basis for giving an appropriate remedy.” (UCC §2-204 is explored in more depth in Section C of this chapter.) Section 27 of the Restatement (Second) states: “Manifestations of assent that are in themselves sufficient to conclude a contract will not be prevented <span title="94" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-94">p. 94</span>from so operating by the fact that the parties also manifest an intention to prepare and adopt a written memorial thereof; but the circumstances may show that the agreements are preliminary negotiations.” Both the UCC and the Restatement thus agree with the <i>Quake</i> court that whether a contract is formed in such cases turns on the factual question of whether the parties intended to be contractually bound at the point when they agreed in principle, or only if further negotiations proved successful. The court in <i>Quake</i> identified a number of factors that would be relevant to a determination of the parties’ intention. Restatement (Second) §27, Comment <i>c</i> contains a similar list. The <i>Quake</i> court remanded the case for trial on this factual issue. Based on the facts set forth in the opinion, how do you think the factual question of intention to be bound should be resolved? Note that in this area, at least, contract law does appear to make the result depend to some extent on the “subjective” issue of actual intent.</p></li>

As concurring Justice Stamos indicates, however, there is a third possibility — that by executing the letter of intent the parties bound themselves to negotiate in good faith to attempt to reach agreement on a construction contract, while also reserving the right to terminate their negotiations if they should be unable to reach agreement. In his concurrence, Justice Stamos refers to an article written by Professor Knapp in 1969. Charles L. Knapp, Enforcing the Contract to Bargain, 44 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 673 (1969). That article and the issues it discusses are further explored in the Comment below. If the court in <i>Quake</i> had recognized a cause of action for breach of the duty to bargain in good faith, should Jones have been held to have breached the duty? If so, what should Quake’s remedy have been?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0325da76-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Protection of reliance.</i> The court in <i>Quake</i> recognizes the possibility that promises contained in a letter of intent could induce a change of position by one of the parties, possibly giving rise to reliance-based protection. Other courts have also accepted this theory of recovery. In Arcadian Phosphates, Inc. v. Arcadian Corp., 884 F.2d 69 (2d Cir. 1989), the plaintiff sought to enforce what it asserted was a contract to bargain in good faith toward the purchase by the plaintiff of the defendant’s phosphate fertilizer business. The parties’ memorandum clearly contemplated the possibility that the parties would not reach a full and final agreement, which the court regarded as expressing their intent not to be bound by the memorandum. However, the evidence did indicate that the defendants insisted on a substantial change in the deal when market conditions altered, and that the defendants might have violated a promise to bargain in good faith. Such a promise might give rise to a duty to compensate the plaintiff on a “promissory estoppel” basis, the court held, particularly since the remedy for promissory estoppel could appropriately be limited to compensation of the plaintiff’s out-of-pocket costs. Id. at 74, n.2. In Chapter 3 we discuss promissory estoppel as a possible basis for obligation when a traditional contract does not exist.<span title="95" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-95">p. 95</span></p></li>

In 1984, the Board of Directors of Getty Oil Company voted to accept an offer from Pennzoil Company to merge Getty with Pennzoil, and Getty issued a press release declaring the existence of an “agreement in principle” between it, Pennzoil, and certain Getty stockholders. Drafting of implementation agreements between the parties proceeded expeditiously. At the same time, however, the Getty interests pursued the possibility of a better offer elsewhere, and in a few days announced their agreement to sell all the shares of Getty to Texaco, Inc., at a higher price per share than Pennzoil had agreed to pay. Pennzoil attempted unsuccessfully to enjoin in Delaware the consummation of the Texaco-Getty merger, after which it sued Texaco in the Texas courts for tortious interference with Pennzoil’s asserted contractual right to acquire the Getty shares. A Texas civil jury found for Pennzoil, and awarded it actual damages of $7.53 billion, plus an additional $3 billion in punitive damages — a judgment that was said at the time to be “the largest civil judgment in history.” Wall St. J., Nov. 20, 1985, at 3, col. 1. The lower court’s judgment was affirmed by the Texas Court of Appeals in a 99-page opinion, 729 S.W.2d 768 (Tex. Ct. App. 1987). After other litigation in the federal courts, culminating in Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., 481 U.S. 1 (1987), the case was finally closed by the payment to Pennzoil by Texaco of $3 billion in cash.</p>
<p id="03260189-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If only because of the sheer magnitude of the dollar amounts at stake, Pennzoil v. Texaco was the focus of much attention at the time, not merely from the business community but from the public in general. From a legal point of view, the case was just as notable for the variety and complexity of the legal issues it raised. These included not merely issues of contract and tort but complex questions of federal procedure, federalism and constitutional law, as well as the federal regulation of trading in securities (plus, in the final stages, federal bankruptcy law). For us at this point, however, the most interesting legal question was the threshold one faced initially by the Texas trial jury: Were the Getty interests bound by an agreement to sell their stock to Pennzoil? The trial court’s instructions to the jury included the following:</p>

<p id="032628a3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the preceding Notes point out, the majority in the <i>Quake</i> case takes toward the issue of contract formation the same binary position that Professor Corbin took in the passage quoted at the beginning of this section: Either the parties intended to be completely bound by their letter of intent (in which case a court might have to “fill in the blanks” in order to enforce that contract), or they didn’t (in which case neither party has any ongoing obligation to the other); a mere “agreement to agree,” however, is not a binding contract. In his <i>Quake</i> concurrence, however, Justice Stamos suggests a third possibility: The parties’ execution of the letter of intent bound the parties to negotiate in good faith to attempt to reach agreement on a construction contract, but the parties reserved the right to terminate the negotiations should they be unsuccessful in reaching agreement. Professor Knapp, in his 1969 article cited by Justice Stamos, advocated judicial recognition of the contract to bargain in good faith:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="032628a4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the typical “formal contract contemplated” case, the parties have clearly intended a bargain; they have also reached the stage of agreement on at least a number of the material terms of the proposed exchange. However, for some reason, they both apparently contemplate the later execution of a full, formal written document. At this stage of the negotiations, there are once again a number of possible views which the parties may entertain as to the extent to which each of them is “bound,” by good business ethics, to the proposed exchange of performances:</p>
<p id="032628a5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="97" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-97">p. 97</span>(1) Each may regard himself as not bound to anything at all unless and until a formal writing is signed by him, and, further, as being free to refuse to sign that writing for any reason whatsoever . . . . There are many cases in which it is impossible to believe that the parties intended any liability to attach to either side until final execution of the contemplated formal document.</p>
<p id="032628a6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(2) Each party may really feel that the “formal” document is only a “formality” — some sort of ritual, desirable for one or more reasons, but in no sense a prerequisite to a “binding” agreement . . . .</p>
<p id="032628a7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In each of the two preceding characterizations of the “formal contract contemplated” situation, the parties may have actually reached agreement on every detail of their proposed exchange. In any such case where at the relevant point in negotiation there remain terms on which agreement has not been expressly reached, there is yet a third possibility:</p>
<p id="032628a8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(3) It is possible that the principals have carried the “deal” as far as they can, and that they are relying on their agents (almost always including lawyers, but possibly also accountants and other experts) to complete the process of agreement. In this view of the facts, the purpose of preparing the formal document is not simply to postpone creation of an obligation, or even to provide evidence of its existence or terms, but rather to afford these experts an opportunity to add to the total agreement such protection against various risks as they think necessary or prudent. On this assumption, the principals are likely to feel ethically bound to the outlines of the deal as they have hammered it out, the withdrawal of either one based simply on dissatisfaction with those outlines being regarded by both as admittedly unjustified. The principals, however, are likely to consider themselves still morally free to withdraw if and when it should appear that the “second team” of bargainers have raised a substantial issue on which they are unable to agree and which the principals, when apprised of the difficulty, are likewise unable to resolve.</p>
</div>
<p id="032628a9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Charles L. Knapp, Enforcing the Contract to Bargain, 44 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 673, 682-684 (1969). The article goes on to argue that where the true state of mind of the parties is the third of those described above, the court should regard them as bound by a contract to bargain in good faith. That contract should be potentially enforceable by damages or specific relief, if appropriate. However, if good faith bargaining should fail to yield a complete agreement, then each party should be free to withdraw from the transaction. In other words, the legal effect of the “agreement to agree” or “formal contract contemplated” should more closely reflect the actual intention of the parties: They should be neither completely free (to withdraw for any reason whatever), nor completely bound (should they later be unable to agree).</p>
<p id="03264fba-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a 1987 article (also cited by Justice Stamos), Professor E. Allan Farnsworth also found a middle ground between pure negotiation on the one hand and complete agreement on the other. He identified two forms of agreement in this middle area. One of these, which he called an “agreement to negotiate,” is the substantial equivalent of Professor Knapp’s “contract to bargain.” E. Allan Farnsworth, Precontractual Liability and Preliminary Agreements: Fair Dealing and Failed Negotiations, 87 Colum. L. Rev. 217 (1987). The Farnsworth article contains a useful discussion of various bargaining tactics viewed through the <span title="98" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-98">p. 98</span>lens of “fair dealing,” and, in an Appendix, describes several common types of preliminary agreement, such as real estate binders, mortgage commitment letters, and letters of intent in mergers and acquisitions, indicating how each might be characterized using his mode of analysis.</p>
<p id="03264fbb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A number of courts have recognized the concept of a contract to bargain in good faith. In Butler v. Balolia, 736 F.2d 609 (1st Cir. 2013), a federal appellate court had to decide whether a contract to negotiate would probably be enforceable under the law of Washington state. In the course of deciding that issue (in the affirmative), the court noted that many more jurisdictions had accepted the enforceability of contracts to negotiate than had repudiated that doctrine, and that the “trend line appears to be moving steadily” in that direction. Id. at 614. See, e.g., TRT Transportation, Inc. v. Aksoy, 506 Fed. Appx. 511 (7th Cir. 2013) (oral settlement agreement enforceable despite failure to reduce to writing; terms sufficiently definite to enforce despite parties failure to agree on other terms).</p>
<p id="03264fbc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, even if a particular court does recognize a duty to bargain in good faith, it will still be necessary for the plaintiff to establish a breach of that duty. E.g., see Venture Associates Corp. v. Zenith Data Systems Corp., 96 F.3d 275, 279 (7th Cir. 1996) (defendant was free to negotiate for new terms not mentioned in the letter of intent, or for changes in terms mentioned in the letter, including the price, so long as it “was not trying to scuttle the deal”); IDT Corp. v. Tyco Group, 918 N.E. 2d 913, 916 (N.Y. 2009) (parties negotiated open terms for almost three years; no evidence that party failed to act in good faith).</p>

Super’s publications are of course copyrighted, and their principal recurring characters are also registered trademarks, which Super licenses to numerous manufacturers for use on merchandise of various kinds designed for the teen and pre-teen market. Recently Super has been engaged in a negotiation with JayRan Products, Inc., a maker of various toys and novelties, looking to the licensing of JayRan to use the names and pictures of “The Ribbets,” a family of comic frogs featured in one of Super’s publications, on a line of lunchboxes and related items (thermos bottles, plastic plates and utensils, etc.) for the back-to-school market. You recently met with the vice president and the chief legal counsel of JayRan to discuss this transaction. (Although Diana Hunter, the president of Super, customarily approves and signs such licensing agreements on behalf of Super, she usually delegates to you the task of negotiating and drafting the agreements.) At that meeting, you and they agreed on the essential terms of the proposed licensing agreement — the rate of royalty payments to be made by JayRan, the products on which the Ribbets would be featured, the length of time the licensing agreement would run (one year, commencing next June 1), the technical and design assistance to be provided by Super, the sales reports and other data to be provided by JayRan from which their royalty payments would be computed, and <span title="99" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-99">p. 99</span>the circumstances under which one party or the other would have the right to terminate the agreement. At the conclusion of that meeting, it was agreed that you as counsel for Super would prepare a written agreement in form satisfactory to Super and forward it to JayRan’s attorney, for approval and — if satisfactory to him — signing by Jay Randolph, the president of JayRan.</p>
<p id="03264fc0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Three days ago you completed a draft of the agreement between Super and JayRan. (The drafting task was for you an easy one; the agreement is of a type entered into by Super many times every year and contains many — from your point of view — “standard” clauses.) You then sent (by messenger) four unsigned copies of the draft agreement to Marion Gerber, attorney for JayRan, along with the following letter (signed by you):</p>

The Octopus proposal would require that Super grant it an exclusive license for a one-year period to feature the Ribbets in any manner on, connected with, or related to, food or food products. Hunter tells you she is very anxious to pursue the Octopus deal, which appears likely to be financially very attractive, but that she views the exclusivity clause that they have requested as inconsistent with the proposed licensing of the Ribbets for JayRan’s lunchboxes. She asks you whether there is any reason at this point why the negotiations with JayRan cannot be suspended or simply broken off entirely with no liability on Super’s part.</p>

<p id="032676d7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Marigold Realty Corp. (“Marigold”) is a corporation that owns a large tract of land in your city, on which is located a large shopping center known as Marigold Plaza. (Marigold has also developed Marigold Manor and Marigold Mountain, residential subdivisions that surround the land occupied by Marigold Plaza.) In Marigold Plaza are two retail shoe stores. One of these is operated by a local merchant; the other is currently occupied by a store that is part of a national chain of retail shoe stores. The local shoe merchant has recently decided to close out his business and retire at the expiration of his current lease. StepRite, Inc., the proprietor of another national shoe store chain, is interested in opening a store in the premises to be vacated, and is actively negotiating with Marigold <span title="100" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-100">p. 100</span>to that end. Marigold has submitted to StepRite the form of lease used for the present tenant, and StepRite has concurred generally with its treatment of such issues as utilities, insurance, security, hours of operation, obligations of maintenance, and the like. The amount of the rent has yet to be agreed on, however. If the rent is to be a fixed monthly sum, Marigold has yet to agree to anything less than $10,000 per month, while StepRite has yet to offer more than $7,500. (Both parties agree that if the rent is to be a fixed sum per month, there will be an escalator clause for an annual percentage increase in rent; the amount of that percentage is as yet undetermined — the numbers discussed have ranged from 3 to 6 percent.) As an alternative, the parties have considered a rental based in part on a percentage of the tenant’s gross receipts from sales; StepRite has suggested a fixed rental of $3,500 per month (again, subject to an annual percentage increase) plus 3 percent of the gross.</p>
<p id="032676d8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Besides the rental, several other terms remain to be agreed on. One is the duration of the lease. StepRite would like a five-year term with an option on its part to extend for another five years; Marigold is generally amenable to this, but would probably insist on some provision for renegotiation of the rent at the end of the first five-year term. Another point remaining to be settled relates to renovation of the leased premises. Ordinarily the lessee of such a store would itself bear the cost of whatever renovation might be needed, even though at the end of the lease term nonremovable improvements (such as painting, carpeting, lighting fixtures) would inure to the benefit of the landlord. StepRite is arguing, however, that because the store has been previously occupied, the cost of interior decoration will be higher than it would be in a new building, and that some of that cost should be absorbed in some manner by Marigold. While all these points remain the subject of active discussion and negotiation, StepRite and Marigold appear genuinely anxious to reach agreement with each other and to believe that such agreement is only a matter of time and some effort on their respective parts.</p>
<p id="032676d9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Until now, the negotiations between Marigold and StepRite have proceeded at a rather leisurely pace, because the expiration of the present tenant’s lease is several months away. However, StepRite has just been presented with the opportunity to open a store in another local shopping center, in premises which have unexpectedly become vacant on short notice. StepRite has been given only a few days to consider whether it wants to avail itself of this other opportunity, after which that landlord will probably make arrangements with another tenant (one slightly less attractive than StepRite but ready to move quickly). StepRite would prefer to be in Marigold Plaza, and has no desire to operate more than one store in your city. However, it does not want to let this new opportunity go by unless it has assurances that the negotiations with Marigold are going to reach fruition.</p>

<p id="03269df2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When lawyers and judges list the basic elements of a contract in the Anglo-American system, in addition to the requirement of agreement (perhaps referred to as “mutual assent” or “offer and acceptance”), they invariably speak of the requirement of “consideration.” “A promise is not enforceable,” judges have been routinely declaring for years, “unless it is supported by consideration.” Because of its historical status as a long-standing common law doctrine, consideration traditionally has been one of the prominent ingredients of a course in basic American contract law. In recent years, however, its importance has been called into question, because of the relative rarity of real-world contract disputes in which the presence or absence of consideration is likely to be a decisive factor. Consideration, it is often asserted, should be de-emphasized or perhaps even ignored in the contracts classroom.</p>
<p id="03269df3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To understand why this is so, one needs to know how this element has been defined. In an earlier formulation, one which is still in widespread use today, consideration was defined in terms of either “benefit to the promisor” or “detriment to the promisee.” The “promisor” in this case is the one who made the promise the enforcement of which is in question. (If the dispute has escalated into a lawsuit, that person is probably the defendant.) The “promisee” is thus the person to whom that promise was made (probably, the plaintiff). This version asks: Did the person making the promise get something for it (“receive a benefit”)? Did the other person part with something (“suffer a detriment”)? The “benefit/detriment” analysis can be seen in action in the courts’ discussions in the <i>Hamer</i> and <i>Dougherty</i> cases, below, and its origins are explored in note 2 after <i>Hamer</i> and the Comment on the casebook website.</p>
<p id="03269df4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="102" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-102">p. 102</span>For over a century, however, it also has been common to define consideration in terms of “exchange.” See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Contracts §71. In this version, there is consideration for a promise if its performance would be part of a “bargained-for exchange,” in which one party’s performance is the “price” of the other’s, and vice versa. Since the vast majority of significant commercial transactions do contemplate an exchange of something (goods, real estate, services, etc.) for something else (typically, but not necessarily, money), the requirement of consideration in most business contracts automatically will be satisfied. (There may still be commercial situations in which the presence or absence of consideration is more problematic, however; some of these are illustrated by the <i>Pennsy Supply</i> and <i>Marshall Durbin</i> cases, below.)</p>
<p id="03269df5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the promise in question is not part of a commercial transaction, but is made by one family member to another, or grows out of a friendly (or even romantic) relationship, consideration may not be so obviously present. Certainly, family members and friends (romantic or otherwise) can and do engage in exchange transactions between themselves — transactions which courts can and ordinarily do regard as examples of conventional contract. But sometimes such a non-commercial promise is clearly gratuitous, not made in return for any “quid pro quo.” In such cases, conventional-contract enforcement of that promise may not be available, although — as we shall see in Chapter 3 — there may be other bases on which the disappointed promisee can claim some remedial protection. In the main, however, contract law is concerned with exchange transactions, in which the possible absence of consideration is usually not a major issue.</p>

<p id="0326c50d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff presented a claim to the executor of William E. Story, Sr., for $5,000 and interest from the 6th day of February, 1875. She acquired it through several mesne assignments from William E. Story, 2d. The claim being rejected by the executor, this action was brought. It appears that William E. Story, Sr., was the uncle of William E. Story, 2d; that at the celebration of the golden wedding of Samuel Story and wife, father and mother of William E. Story, Sr., on the 20th day of March, 1869, in the presence of the family and invited guests he promised his nephew that if he would refrain from drinking, using tobacco, swearing and playing cards or billiards for money until he became twenty-one years of age he would pay him a sum of $5,000.

I have no doubt but you have, for which you shall have five thousand dollars as I promised you. I had the money in the bank the day you was 21 years old that I intend for you, and you shall have the money certain. Now, Willie I do not intend to interfere with this money in any way till I think you are capable of taking care of it and the sooner that time comes the better it will please me. I would hate very much to have you start out in some adventure that you thought all right and lose this money in one year . . . . Willie, you are 21 and you have many a thing to learn yet. This money you have earned much easier than I did besides acquiring good habits at the same time and you are quite welcome to the money; hope you will make good use of it. I was ten long years getting this together after I was your age. Now, hoping this will be satisfactory, I stop. One thing more. Twenty-one years ago I bought you 15 sheep. These sheep were put out to double every four years. I kept track of them the first eight years; I have not heard much about them since. Your father and grandfather promised me that they would look after them till you were of age. Have they done so? I hope they have. By this time you have between five and six hundred sheep, worth a nice little income this spring. Willie, I have said much more than I expected to; hope you can make out what I have written. To-day is the seventeenth day that I have not been out of my room, and have had the doctor as many days. Am a little better to-day; think I will get out next week.

<p id="0326c514-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Parker, J. The question which provoked the most discussion by counsel on this appeal, and which lies at the foundation of plaintiff’s asserted right of recovery, is whether by virtue of a contract defendant’s testator William E. Story became indebted to his nephew William E. Story, 2d, on his twenty-first birthday in the sum of five thousand dollars. The trial court found as a fact that “on the 20th day of March, 1869,  . . . William E. Story agreed to and with William E. Story, 2d, that if he would refrain from drinking liquor, using tobacco, swearing, and playing cards or billiards for money until he should become 21 years <span title="104" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-104">p. 104</span>of age then he, the said William E. Story, would at that time pay him, the said William E. Story, 2d, the sum of $5,000 for such refraining, to which the said William E. Story, 2d, agreed,” and that he “in all things fully performed his part of said agreement.”</p>
<p id="0326c515-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant contends that the contract was without consideration to support it, and, therefore, invalid. He asserts that the promisee by refraining from the use of liquor and tobacco was not harmed but benefited; that that which he did was best for him to do independently of his uncle’s promise, and insists that it follows that unless the promisor was benefited, the contract was without consideration. A contention, which if well founded, would seem to leave open for controversy in many cases whether that which the promisee did or omitted to do was, in fact, of such benefit to him as to leave no consideration to support the enforcement of the promisor’s agreement. Such a rule could not be tolerated, and is without foundation in the law. The Exchequer Chamber, in 1875, defined consideration as follows: “A valuable consideration in the sense of the law may consist either in some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to the one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other.” Courts “will not ask whether the thing which forms the consideration does in fact benefit the promisee or a third party, or is of any substantial value to anyone. It is enough that something is promised, done, forborne or suffered by the party to whom the promise is made as consideration for the promise made to him.” (Anson’s Prin. of Con. 63.)</p>
<p id="0326ec26-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“In general a waiver of any legal right at the request of another party is a sufficient consideration for a promise.” (Parsons on Contracts, 444.)</p>
<p id="0326ec27-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Any damage, or suspension, or forbearance of a right will be sufficient to sustain a promise.” (Kent, vol. 2, 465, 12th ed.)</p>
<p id="0326ec28-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Pollock, in his work on contracts, page 166, after citing the definition given by the Exchequer Chamber already quoted, says: “The second branch of this judicial description is really the most important one. Consideration means not so much that one party is profiting as that the other abandons some legal right in the present or limits his legal freedom of action in the future as an inducement for the promise of the first.”</p>
<p id="0326ec29-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now, applying this rule to the facts before us, the promisee used tobacco, occasionally drank liquor, and he had a legal right to do so. That right he abandoned for a period of years upon the strength of the promise of the testator that for such forbearance he would give him $5,000. We need not speculate on the effort which may have been required to give up the use of those stimulants. It is sufficient that he restricted his lawful freedom of action within certain prescribed limits upon the faith of his uncle’s agreement, and now having fully performed the conditions imposed, it is of no moment whether such performance actually proved a benefit to the promisor, and the court will not inquire into it, but were it a proper subject of inquiry, we see nothing in this record that would permit a determination that the uncle was not benefited in a legal sense. Few cases have been found which may be said to be precisely in point, but such as have been support the position we have taken.</p>

Defendant demurred on the ground, among others, that the plaintiff’s declaration did not allege a valid and sufficient consideration for the agreement of the defendant. The demurrer was over-ruled.</p>
<p id="0326ec30-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Talbott v. Stemmons (a Kentucky case not yet reported), the step-grandmother of the plaintiff made with him the following agreement: “I do promise and bind myself to give my grandson, Albert R. Talbott, $500 at my death, if he will never take another chew of tobacco or smoke another cigar during my life from this date up to my death, and if he breaks his pledge he is to refund double the amount to his mother.” The executor of Mrs. Stemmons demurred to the complaint on the ground that the agreement was not based on a sufficient consideration. The demurrer was sustained and an appeal taken therefrom to the Court of Appeals, where the decision of the court below was reversed. In the opinion of the court it is said that “the right to use and enjoy the use of tobacco was a right that belonged to the plaintiff and not forbidden by law. The abandonment of its use may have saved him money or contributed to his health, nevertheless, the surrender of that right caused the promise, and having the right to contract with reference to the subject-matter, the abandonment of the use was a sufficient consideration to uphold the promise.” Abstinence from the use of intoxicating liquors was held to furnish a good consideration for a promissory note in Lindell v. Rokes (60 Mo. 249) . . . .</p>
<p id="0326ec31-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The defendant also argued that even if the uncle’s promise had originally given rise to an enforceable obligation, the plaintiff’s action to enforce that promise was barred by the statute of limitations — too much time had passed since the cause of action arose. The court held, however, that the uncle’s letter amounted to a “declaration of trust,” making the uncle himself a “trustee” of the promised sum on behalf of his nephew as “beneficiary.” The case thus was viewed not as the mere attempt to enforce an executory promise, but as an action to compel the delivery of a sum of money held in trust; the uncle’s original promise was viewed as having in a legal sense already been performed. — <span class="epub-small-caps">Eds</span>.]</p>

<li class=""><p id="0327134b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Historical background.</i> As we noted in the introduction to this section, the test for consideration employed by the court in <i>Hamer</i> is not the only one a court might use; the Restatement uses a “bargained-for exchange” analysis, which we will address below. The “benefit/detriment” test used in <i>Hamer</i> has deep roots in Anglo-American contract law. The casebook website contains a Comment on the history of the consideration doctrine and the “benefit/detriment” test. As discussed in more detail in that Comment, early English courts did not recognize what we today would call a cause of action or a claim for relief. Instead, the courts used a “writ” system. To obtain a remedy from a court, the plaintiff had to show that his situation fit within one of a number of writs. Early “contract-like” writs — the writs of covenant and debt — had specific requirements: To obtain the writ of covenant, the plaintiff had to show that the defendant made a promise in a sealed instrument; the writ of debt was available if the defendant breached a promise to pay a sum-certain of money. By 1600 the <span title="107" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-107">p. 107</span>writ of assumpsit replaced covenant and debt and became the general writ to recover for breach or nonperformance of a promise. Unlike covenant or debt, assumpsit did not have specific requirements other than the defendant’s breach or nonperformance of a promise. As assumpsit evolved, it became customary to plead the factors that the defendant had considered in making his promise. The concepts of detriment to the promisee and benefit to the promisor, which were used quite early, came to represent the paradigms of consideration. One in-depth exploration of the history of the consideration doctrine is contained in Alfred W. B. Simpson, A History of the Common Law of Contract (1987).</p></li>

Count I raises a breach of contract claim. “A cause of action for breach of contract must be established by pleading (1) the existence of a contract, including its essential terms, (2) a breach of a duty imposed by the contract and (3) resultant damages.” Corestates Bank, N.A. v. Cutillo, 723 A.2d 1053, 1058 (Pa. Super. 1999). While not every term of a contract must be stated in complete detail, every element must be specifically pleaded. Id. at 1058.

Instantly, the trial court determined that “any alleged agreement between the parties is unenforceable for lack of consideration.” Trial Court Opinion, 5/27/05, at 5. The trial court also stated “the facts as pleaded do not support an inference that disposal costs were part of any bargaining process <i>or</i> that American Ash offered the AggRite with an intent to avoid disposal costs.” Id. at 7 (emphasis added). Thus, we understand the trial court to have dismissed Count I for two reasons related to the necessary element of consideration: one, the allegations of the Complaint established that Pennsy had received a conditional gift from American Ash, see Id. 6, 8, and, two, there were no allegations in the Complaint to show that American Ash’s avoidance of disposal costs was part of any bargaining process between the parties.

The detriment incurred must be the “quid pro quo”, or the “price” of the promise, and the inducement for which it was made . . . . If the promisor merely intends to make a gift to the promisee upon the performance of a condition, the promise is gratuitous and the satisfaction of the condition is not consideration for a contract. The distinction between such a conditional gift and a contract is well illustrated in Williston on Contracts, Rev. Ed., Vol. 1, Section 112, where it is said: “If a benevolent man says to a tramp, ‘If you go around the corner to the clothing shop there, you may purchase an overcoat on my credit,’ no reasonable person would understand that the short walk was requested as the consideration for the promise, but that in the event of the tramp going to the shop the promisor would make him a gift.”</p>

The classic formula for the difficult concept of consideration was stated by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., as “the promise must induce the detriment and the detriment must induce the promise.” John Edward Murray, Jr., Murray on Contracts §60 (3d. ed. 1990), at 227 (citing Wisconsin &amp; Michigan Ry. v.

<p id="0327889d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As to the distinction between consideration and a condition, it is often difficult to determine whether words of condition in a promise indicate a request for consideration or state a mere condition in a gratuitous promise. An aid, though not a conclusive test, in determining which construction of the promise is more reasonable is an inquiry into <i>whether the occurrence of the condition would benefit the promisor. If so, it is a fair inference that the occurrence was requested as consideration</i>. On the other hand, if the occurrence of the condition is no benefit to the promisor but is merely to enable the promisee to receive a gift, the occurrence of the event on which the promise is conditional, though brought about by the promisee in reliance on the promise, is not properly construed as consideration.</p>

Upon review, we disagree with the trial court that the allegations of the Complaint show only that American Ash made a conditional gift of the AggRite to Pennsy. In paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Complaint, Pennsy alleged:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="032788a0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">American Ash actively promotes the use of AggRite as a building material to be used in base course of paved structures, and provides the material free of charge, in an effort to have others dispose of the material and thereby avoid incurring the disposal costs itself  . . . American Ash provided the AggRite to Pennsy for use on the Project, which saved American Ash thousands of dollars in disposal costs it otherwise would have incurred.</p>
</div>
<p id="032788a1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Compl. ¶¶8, 9. Accepting these allegations as true and using the Holmesian formula for consideration, it is a fair interpretation of the Complaint that American Ash’s promise to supply AggRite free of charge induced Pennsy to assume the detriment of collecting and taking title to the material, and critically, that it was this very detriment, whether assumed by Pennsy or some other successful bidder to the paving subcontract, which induced American Ash to make the promise to provide free AggRite for the project. Paragraphs 8-9 of the Complaint simply belie the notion that American Ash offered AggRite as a conditional gift to the successful bidder on the paving subcontract for which American Ash desired and expected nothing in return.</p>
<p id="0327afb2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">11.

The Complaint does not allege that the parties discussed or even that Pennsy understood at the time it requested or accepted the AggRite that Pennsy’s use of the AggRite would allow American Ash to avoid disposal costs.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10E47_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10E47_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">5</a></span> However, we do not believe such is necessary. The bargain theory of consideration does not actually require that the parties bargain over the terms of the agreement . . . . According to Holmes, an influential advocate of the bargain theory, what is required [for consideration to exist] is that the promise and the consideration be in “the relation of reciprocal conventional inducement, each for the other.” Allen Farnsworth, Farnsworth on Contracts §2.6 (1990) (citing O. Holmes, The Common Law 293-94 (1881)); see also Restatement (Second) of Contracts §71 (defining “bargained for” in terms of the Holmesian formula). Here, as explained above, the Complaint alleges facts which, if proven, would show the promise induced the detriment and the detriment induced the promise. This would be consideration. Accordingly, we reverse the dismissal of Count I.</p>

<li class=""><p id="0327afb8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Disposal costs</i>. It may seem odd that Pennsy Supply sought in this lawsuit to recover the costs it incurred to dispose of the AggRite, given its argument that the consideration for its contract with American Ash was that this arrangement relieved American Ash of disposal costs. However, Pennsy planned on using the AggRite in paving work, which should not have involved any disposal expenses. The only reason Pennsy incurred these costs was that the AggRite was defective, requiring that it be removed and disposed of. Put another way: Pennsy did agree to take the AggRite “off American Ash’s hands,” but it did not agree to dispose of the AggRite in a way that would have required it to pay the expenses of disposal.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0327afb9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Pennsy’s claims for breach of warranty under Article 2.</i> Pennsy’s complaint alleged causes of action for breach of various warranties under Article 2 of the UCC. We examine these warranties in Chapter 6. Most courts have restricted Article 2 warranties to contracts for the sale of goods. (UCC Article 2A, dealing <span title="112" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-112">p. 112</span>with goods-leasing transactions, imposes somewhat similar warranties.) If the court had accepted American Ash’s contention that it made only a conditional gift to Pennsy, then Pennsy would have been unable to recover on these warranty theories. (However, it might still have had a claim for promissory estoppel, which, as we will see in the next chapter, does not depend on the existence of a contract between the parties.)</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0327afba-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Consideration? Or only a condition to a gift?</i> The trial court had held that Pennsy’s disposal costs did not constitute consideration for any promise by American Ash, because those costs were a mere “condition” to American Ash’s gift of the AggRite to Pennsy. The appellate court rejected this conclusion. (Notice that this court stated that the presence of consideration is a question of law for the court to decide; courts in other jurisdictions might treat such a case differently, leaving it up to the jury to decide whether a contract is present, based on the court’s instructions about the requirements for contract formation.) The distinction between conduct that constitutes consideration and conduct that is a condition to a gift is not a clear one, because the very same conduct may be consideration or a condition to a gift depending on how the parties treat the conduct. To illustrate the distinction, the court invoked Professor Williston’s “an overcoat for the tramp” hypothetical. (Williston’s reference to a “tramp” sounds archaic today, and perhaps ambiguous as well. As Williston used that term, synonyms would be “hobo” or “vagrant”; today we would probably instead say “homeless person.”) What test does the court use to distinguish between consideration and a condition to a gift? Does the test help you to understand the outcome in <i>Pennsy Supply</i>? Can you think of other factors that should be relevant in determining whether conduct constitutes consideration rather than a condition to a gift? We return in Chapter 9 to a fuller exploration of the role that “conditions” play in contract law.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0327afbb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Relationship of the benefit/detriment test and bargain theory of consideration</i>.  Citing prior case law, the court holds that consideration requires a benefit to the promisor or a detriment to the promise, but one that is bargained for. See also Meincke v. Northwest Bank &amp; Trust Co., 756 N.W. 2d 223 (Iowa 2008) (benefit to promisor or detriment to promisee must “induce” the making of the promise to be bargained for); Cobaugh v. Klick-Lewis, Inc., 561 A.2d 1248, 1250 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1989) (golfer who shot hole-in-one entitled to car offered by defendant as prize; court applies both bargained-for-exchange and benefit/detriment tests for consideration). Notice, however, that according to the court in <i>Pennsy Supply</i> the requirement that consideration be bargained for does not require actual bargaining between the parties. The court uses the Holmesian test of “reciprocal conventional inducement, each for the other.” Under this test, American Ash affirmatively sought companies to take AggRite so that American Ash could avoid the disposal costs of this material. Correspondingly, Pennsy’s assumption of this disposal obligation induced American Ash to deliver AggRite to it. Thus, each party’s promise and resulting performance induced the corresponding promise and performance by the other party.</p>
<p id="0327d6cc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Restatement appears to agree with <i>Pennsy Supply</i> that actual negotiation is not required. Restatement §71(2) states simply that a “performance <span title="113" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-113">p. 113</span>or return promise is bargained for if it is sought by the promisor in exchange for his promise and is given by the promisee in exchange for that promise.” Comment <i>b</i> to §71 adopts the Holmesian test of a “reciprocal relation of motive or inducement.” Which view on the issue of negotiation do you think is better as a matter of policy? Can a “bargain” be created without “bargaining”? And does that matter?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0327d6cd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Practical effect of different tests for consideration.</i> For the student attempting to grapple with the niceties of consideration theory, developed over centuries of obscure and often inconsistent case law and commentary, a spoonful of Legal Realism may at this point help the doctrinal medicine go down. As we suggested in the introduction to this section, in the vast majority of real-world cases it will be unnecessary to worry about whether a benefit/detriment or a bargained-for-exchange test for consideration is employed, because the ordinary commercial contract will pass both tests with flying colors. Take for example a contract to sell a parcel of real estate for cash, where the parties exchange promises that at some future date they will exchange performances — cash from the purchaser in return for a conveyance of land from the vendor. Will the parties at that point be bound by their promises? The law’s traditional answer is yes, they will. Even if both parties do no more than exchange promises of future performance, the law regards the making of a promise as sufficient legal “detriment” to bind the promisee to perform a return promise of his own under the benefit/detriment test for consideration. (Of course, the purchaser at the time of signing such an agreement is likely also to pay the vendor a sum of money, either as a “down payment” or as “earnest money,” but that payment, while it furnishes additional consideration for the vendor’s promise to sell, is not necessary to bind the vendor to her bargain.) On the other hand, if the Holmes “bargain” test is applied, the answer is the same: This land-purchase transaction would obviously be viewed as a bargained-for exchange and thus would be supported by consideration. See Restatement (Second) §§71, 77.</p>
<p id="0327d6ce-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In light of the above analysis, the choice between the “benefit/detriment” and “bargained-for exchange” tests for consideration will ordinarily have little effect on the outcome of the question: Is this promise enforceable? As Professor Farnsworth has pointed out, the principal effect of Holmes’s doctrinal shift to the “bargain” test seems to be at the margin: Promises made in a family setting, or otherwise “on the periphery of the marketplace,” might under the bargain theory be more likely to go unenforced, as being non-exchange transactions. By the same token, the promisee’s reliance on a promise, even if truly “detrimental to the promisee” would fail the consideration test unless it was bargained for as the price of that promise. Such reliance would thus go uncompensated, unless some other theory of liability should apply. E. Allan Farnsworth, Contracts 48 (4th ed. 2004). In the next chapter we explore the concept of “promissory estoppel,” which may protect detrimental reliance that was <i>not</i> bargained for.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0327d6cf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The functions of legal formality.</i> Although our legal system is less concerned in general with matters of “form” than was the old English common law, there are even today some formalities that do have a particular legal effect <span title="114" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-114">p. 114</span>when properly employed. The execution of a will is one example; another is the marriage ceremony. In the early days of English law, the seal was employed as a means of creating a binding contractual obligation. Today, however, the seal has little or no force in most jurisdictions, and promises are generally not enforceable merely because “formally” expressed, with or without the presence of a seal. For a survey of the law regarding the use of seals, see Eric Mills Holmes, Stature and Status of a Promise under Seal as a Legal Formality, 29 Willamette L. Rev. 617 (1993). Although clearly out of fashion today, the seal in its heyday did offer a clearly defined method by which persons seeking to create a legally enforceable promise could do so with confidence in its effectiveness. Building on the notion that formality as a legal device does have its uses, Professor Lon Fuller offered the following analysis of the functions that a legal formality may serve:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="0327d6d0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>THE FUNCTIONS PERFORMED BY LEGAL FORMALITIES</b></p>
<p id="0327d6d1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The Evidentiary Function</i>. — The most obvious function of a legal formality is, to use Austin’s words, that of providing “evidence of the existence and purport of the contract, in case of controversy.” The need for evidentiary security may be satisfied in a variety of ways: by requiring a writing, or attestation, or the certification of a notary . . . </p>
<p id="0327d6d2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The Cautionary Function. </i>— A formality may also perform a cautionary or deterrent function by acting as a check against inconsiderate action. The seal in its original form fulfilled this purpose remarkably well. The affixing and impressing of a wax wafer — symbol in the popular mind of legalism and weightiness — was an excellent device for inducing the circumspective frame of mind appropriate in one pledging his future. To a less extent any requirement of a writing, of course, serves the same purpose, as do requirements of attestation, notarization, etc.</p>
<p id="0327d6d3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The Channeling Function.</i> — Though most discussions of the purposes served by formalities go no further than the analysis just presented, this analysis stops short of recognizing one of the most important functions of form. That a legal formality may perform a function not yet described can be shown by the seal. The seal not only insures a satisfactory memorial of the promise and induces deliberation in the making of it. It serves also to mark or signalize the enforceable promise; it furnishes a simple and external test of enforceability. This function of form Ihering described as “the facilitation of judicial diagnosis,” and he employed the analogy of coinage in explaining it . . . .</p>
<p id="0327d6d4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Interrelations of the Three Functions.</i> — Though I have stated the three functions of legal form separately, it is obvious that there is an intimate connection between them. Generally speaking, whatever tends to accomplish one of these purposes will also tend to accomplish the other two. He who is compelled to do something which will furnish a satisfactory memorial of his intention will be induced to deliberate. Conversely, devices which induce deliberation will usually have an evidentiary value. Devices which insure evidence or prevent inconsiderateness will normally advance the desideratum of channeling, in two different ways. In the first place, he who is compelled to formulate his intention carefully will tend to fit it into legal and business categories. In this way the party is induced to canalize his own intention. <span title="115" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-115">p. 115</span>In the second place, wherever the requirement of a formality is backed by the sanction of the invalidity of the informal transaction (and this is the means by which requirements of form are normally made effective), a degree of channeling results automatically. Whatever may be its legislative motive, the formality in such a case tends to effect a categorization of transactions into legal and non-legal.</p>

<p id="0327d6d5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lon L. Fuller, Consideration and Form, 41 Colum. L. Rev. 799, 800-803 (1941). Professor Fuller’s article goes on to argue that although the seal for various reasons has “decayed,” the doctrine of consideration can and often does serve one or all of the above functions that the seal used to serve. While Fuller’s analysis seems to be a useful general discussion of the policies that might be served by a legal “formality,” subsequent writers have been skeptical of Fuller’s “functions of form” thesis as it relates to the doctrine of consideration. E.g., Andrew Kull, Reconsidering Gratuitous Promises, 21 J. Legal Stud. 39, 51-55 (1992) (seal may have served such functions well, but consideration doctrine does so poorly that the absence of consideration should not be a conclusive argument against enforcement of a promise). Does the requirement of consideration effectively serve the evidentiary, cautionary, and channeling functions? We will refer to Fuller’s discussion of “form” in later sections of these materials that more obviously involve legal “formalities.”</p></li>

The plaintiff, a boy of eight years, received from his aunt, the defendant’s testatrix, a promissory note for $3,000 payable at her death or before. Use was made of a printed form, which contains the words “value received.” How the note came to be given, was explained by the boy’s guardian, who was a witness for his ward. The aunt was visiting her nephew. “When she saw Charley coming in, she said ‘Isn’t he a nice boy?’ I answered her, yes, that he is getting along very nice, and getting along nice in school, and I showed where he had progressed in school, having good reports, and so forth, and she told me that she was going to take care of that child, that she loved him very much. I said, ‘I know you do, Tillie, but your taking care of the child will be done probably like your brother and sister done, take it out in talk.’ She said: ‘I don’t intend to take it out in talk, I would like to take care of him now.’ I said, ‘Well, that is up to you.’ She said, ‘Why can’t I make out a note to him?’ I said, ‘You can, if you wish to.’ She said, ‘Would that be right?’ And I said, ‘I do not know, but I guess it would; I do not know why it would not.’ And she said, ‘Well, will you make out a note for me?’ I said, ‘Yes, if you wish me to,’ and she said, ‘Well, I wish you would.’ ” A blank was then produced, filled out, and signed. The aunt handed the note to her nephew with these words, “You have always done for me, and I have signed this note for you. Now, do not lose it. Some day it will be valuable.”</p>
<p id="0327fdec-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="116" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-116">p. 116</span>The trial judge submitted to the jury the question whether there was any consideration for the promised payment. Afterwards, he set aside the verdict in favor of the plaintiff, and dismissed the complaint. The Appellate Division, by a divided court, reversed the judgment of dismissal, and reinstated the verdict on the ground that the note was sufficient evidence of consideration.</p>
<p id="0327fded-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We reach a different conclusion. The inference of consideration to be drawn from the form of the note has been so overcome and rebutted as to leave no question for a jury. This is not a case where witnesses summoned by the defendant and friendly to the defendant’s cause, supply the testimony in disproof of value (Strickland v. Henry, 175 N.Y. 372). This is a case where the testimony in disproof of value comes from the plaintiff’s own witness, speaking at the plaintiff’s instance. The transaction thus revealed admits of one interpretation, and one only. The note was the voluntary and unenforcible promise of an executory gift (Harris v. Clark, 3 N.Y. 93; Holmes v. Roper, 141 N.Y. 64, 66). This child of eight was not a creditor, nor dealt with as one. The aunt was not paying a debt. She was conferring a bounty (Fink v. Cox, 18 Johns. 145). The promise was neither offered nor accepted with any other purpose. “Nothing is consideration that is not regarded as such by both parties” (Philpot v. Gruninger, 14 Wall. 570, 577; Fire Ins. Assn. v. Wickham, 141 U.S. 564, 579; Wisconsin &amp; M. Ry. Co. v. Powers, 191 U.S. 379, 386; DeCicco v. Schweizer, 221 N.Y. 431, 438). A note so given is not made for “value received,” however its maker may have labeled it. The formula of the printed blank becomes, in the light of the conceded facts, a mere erroneous conclusion, which cannot overcome the inconsistent conclusion of the law (Blanshan v. Russell, 32 App. Div. 103; <i>affd., on opinion below,</i> 161 N.Y. 629; Kramer v. Kramer, 181 N.Y. 477; Bruyn v. Russell, 52 Hun. 17). The plaintiff, through his own witness, has explained the genesis of the promise, and consideration has been disproved (Neg. Instr. Law, sec. 54; Consol. Laws, chap. 43) . . . .</p>

<li class=""><p id="0327fdf1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Dougherty</i></b> <i>compared with </i><b><i>Hamer</i></b>. In <i>Dougherty,</i> as in <i>Hamer,</i> an older person made a promise to a younger relative; enforcement of that promise was resisted later, after the promisor died. The promise in <i>Dougherty</i> was made in a more formal manner than the one in <i>Hamer,</i> but the latter promise was enforced while the former was not. Why? The promissory note that was used in <i>Dougherty</i> is not reproduced in the opinion, but presumably it was a written, signed promise by the aunt to pay her nephew the stated sum at the designated time. There is no indication that the promise was stated to be conditional on anything other than the aunt’s death (that being the event defining the time when payment would be due). Suppose, however, that the note had begun, “In consideration of my nephew Charley having been a good boy until the age of 21 or until my death (whichever shall first occur), I hereby promise . . . .” Should the promise in the note in that case have been an obligation enforceable against the aunt’s estate, just as the uncle’s promise was enforceable in <i>Hamer</i>?</p>
<p id="03282502-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="117" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-117">p. 117</span>In <i>Dougherty,</i> as in <i>Hamer,</i> suit was brought not against the individual promisor, but against the representative of the deceased promisor’s estate. (The defendant in <i>Hamer</i> is referred to as the “executor” and the aunt in <i>Dougherty</i> as the “testatrix,” in both cases the term used indicating that the decedent left a valid will. Where the decedent has died “intestate” — without a will — the representative of the estate is often referred to as the “administrator.” Today the term “personal representative” is used in many jurisdictions to refer to all such representatives.) The <i>Hamer</i> case was further complicated by the fact that the plaintiff was not the promisee himself, but an “assignee” — someone to whom Story had transferred (“assigned”) his right to payment. (The general topic of assignment of contract rights is addressed in Chapter 12.) That might have influenced defendant Sidway’s unwillingness to pay. In <i>Dougherty,</i> however, the plaintiff was Charley himself. There seems to have been no real dispute about the genuineness of the aunt’s promise; nor does it appear that the aunt had changed her mind about Charley’s merits before she died. Why didn’t defendant Salt simply pay the note when it was presented?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03282503-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Should donative promises be enforced?</i> The court in <i>Dougherty</i> indicated that the promise was not supported by any consideration because it was no more than the promise of an “executory gift” (i.e., a gift to be performed in the future). There was no value received by the aunt for her promise, and the mere recital of value would not suffice, where it was plain that no value had in fact been given. Such “donative” promises are frequently made, often by one family member to another and occasionally between persons bound to each other not by blood relationship but by other ties of affection. Such promises also often go unperformed, sometimes because the promisor changes his mind (or the promisee declines to press the point), and sometimes, as in <i>Dougherty,</i> because the promisor dies before she has carried out her intent. Should the law enforce the purely donative promise, without insisting that it be supported by consideration? Professor Melvin Eisenberg has made a survey of this area, concluding that generally enforcement of the purely donative promise seems unnecessary where the promise has not been substantially relied on by the promisee. (The possibility of enforcement in the event of reliance is addressed in the next chapter.) In addition to the substantive reason of lack of reliance, Eisenberg identifies a number of issues that courts would have to consider if they decided to enforce donative promises: how to distinguish a true donative promise from a statement of present intention; whether the law should inquire into the level of deliberation that the donor exercised before making the promise; and to what extent the law should recognize excuses against enforcement of donative promises, such as ingratitude by the donee and improvidence by the donor. Eisenberg concludes: “Thus, despite occasional protests that the law should put its weight behind all promises that are seriously made, there seems to be widespread agreement that informal unrelied-upon donative promises should not be legally enforced.” Melvin A. Eisenberg, Donative Promises, 47 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1, 4-6 (1979). Are Eisenberg’s arguments persuasive? Do they apply to <i>Dougherty</i>?</p>

<p id="03282507-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose a present-day Aunt Tillie comes to you as her attorney, seeking advice regarding how to best confer a future benefit on her nephew Charley. Given the aunt’s objective of somehow presently effecting a gift that will benefit her nephew Charley at some future time, what legal devices could you suggest to accomplish for her the result she seeks?</p>
<p id="03282508-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Promissory Note.</i> The device actually employed in the <i>Dougherty</i> case — a promissory note with a recital of consideration — would probably have no more success with a modern judge than it did with Judge Cardozo in 1919. Comment <i>b</i> to Restatement (Second) §71 states: “Moreover, a mere pretense of bargain does not suffice, as where there is a false recital of consideration or where the purported consideration is merely nominal.” Suppose that instead of just reciting “value received,” the aunt were to receive from her nephew a small amount of money (a dollar or so) in exchange for her promise? Given the minimal nature of the law’s requirement of “legal detriment,” would that supply sufficient consideration for enforcement of her promise? The first Restatement §75 appeared to sanction such “nominal consideration” as a device for making a promise enforceable, but Restatement (Second) §71 unequivocally rejects that possibility, in comment <i>b</i> and the illustration that follows:</p>

<div class="epub-blockquote">

There is no consideration for <i>A’s</i> promise to pay <i>B</i> $1000.</p>
</div>
<p id="0328250a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">See also Weed v. Weed, 968 A.2d 310 (Vt. 2008) (payment of $10 between family members did not induce “sale” of land and thus was a pretense). Assuming therefore that a mere written promise that recites consideration will probably not create an obligation enforceable against the promisor’s estate, what other devices might you advise your client to employ?</p>
<p id="0328250b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Promise Under Seal.</i> English common law enforced promises under seal, in the action of covenant, without requiring any showing of consideration. See <span title="119" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-119">p. 119</span>the Comment on the History of the Consideration Doctrine on the casebook website. Could your client confer an enforceable right on her nephew by signing and delivering to him a <i>sealed</i> promissory note? Such a document will have varying effect today, depending on the jurisdiction involved. As the volume of commercial transactions increased over the years, the original formality of the seal was relaxed, so that it might be no more than a preprinted notation on a contract form (“under seal” or “L.S.” — abbreviation for <i>locus sigilli</i> in Latin); as the seal thus came to be less and less “special,” legislatures responded by depriving it of its special legal effect. Some states have abolished the device altogether; others have reduced its effect to a mere presumption of consideration. See Eric Mills Holmes, Stature and Status of a Promise under Seal as a Legal Formality, 29 Willamette L. Rev. 617 (1993). See also Knott v. Racicot, 812 N.E.2d 1207 (Mass. 2004) (discussing the history and declining importance of the seal; abolishing the common law rule that option contracts under seal import consideration). The Uniform Commercial Code abolished the significance of the seal in sales of goods (UCC §2-203). Restatement (Second) §95 states a rule for enforcement of instruments under seal, but that rule can have effect only where the common law relating to seals has not been displaced by statutes abolishing or weakening the seal’s legal effect. Despite a few recent statutory attempts to create a comparable device, there is today in American law no generally available equivalent of the old English seal for use in creating binding gratuitous obligations.</p>
<p id="0328250c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Executed Gift.</i> The surest way to guarantee that the intended beneficiary of the aunt’s generosity ends up with the money would, obviously, be for her to simply give him (or his guardian, on his behalf) the money now, in cash. While a promise to make a gift in the future is not an enforceable obligation under contract law, property law provides generally that once a gift has been “executed” — delivered by the donor with the intent to make a gift, and accepted by the donee — it is irrevocable and may not be recovered by the donor. Ray A. Brown, The Law of Personal Property 77-78 (3d ed. 1975). However, a gift may be subject to a condition, the failure of which would allow the transferor to recover the property subject to the condition. See Campbell v. Robinson, 726 S.E.2d 221 (S.C. Ct. App. 2012) (holding that, while courts are divided, in South Carolina an “engagement ring” is given on the implied condition of marriage and may be recovered by donor if the marriage does not occur).</p>
<p id="03284c1d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Testamentary Gift.</i> In light of your client’s expressed wish that her nephew receive the money at her death, it would seem logical to suggest that a “testamentary gift” be employed: She could make a will, a “last testament” of her desires as to the disposition of her property after death. If her will is made with such formality as the law requires (typical requirements include a signed writing and the presence of witnesses who also sign, attesting the genuineness of the document), its provisions would be carried out (executed) after her death by her personal representative, the executor of her estate. Assuming that sufficient assets remained after payment of any debts of the estate, the bequest to the nephew would be paid along with any other bequests. In this case, the absence of consideration for the gift would be legally irrelevant. The <span title="120" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-120">p. 120</span>testamentary-gift option has the disadvantage of requiring somewhat more effort than the promissory note used in <i>Dougherty,</i> since a will must be formally signed and witnessed. On the other hand, it should achieve its purpose (assuming the aunt is presently of sufficient mental capacity as required by law). What are its drawbacks? Only two readily appear: This bequest, along with any others, will not be payable until the debts of the estate have been satisfied; should the estate have insufficient assets, an enforceable promissory note (along with any other enforceable debt of the estate) would take priority over a mere testamentary gift. Also, unlike an apparently unconditional promissory note, a testamentary gift is “ambulatory”; it may be freely revoked by a later will.</p>
<p id="03284c1e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Gift in Trust.</i> One other legal device merits mention here. You may recall that in <i>Hamer</i> the court seized on the fact that the uncle had assertedly set aside the money owed his nephew, in order to find that a “trust” had been created (thereby avoiding what would have otherwise been the bar of the statute of limitations, and allowing enforcement of the obligation). If your client presently has the funds to make the gift to her nephew, but does not wish to give him (or his guardian) present control over those funds, she could create a trust on his behalf. As a trust “beneficiary,” he would eventually enjoy the benefits of the gift. For a variety of legal and practical reasons, such “inter vivos” trusts have become a frequently employed vehicle for the gratuitous transfer of wealth between family members. Courses in Trusts and Estate Planning will give you a chance to explore them in depth later in your legal studies.</p>

<p id="03284c27-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="121" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-121">p. 121</span>Most of the employees were participants in group insurance, the premiums for which had been paid approximately one-half by the employee and one-half by the company, and, according to plaintiffs, their parts of the premiums were to be deducted from their payments as formerly. This procedure was followed.</p>
<p id="03284c28-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The employees were retained on the pay roll, but, according to their testimony, they were not to render any further services, their only obligation being to call at the office for their remittances. Most of them testified that it was agreed that the payments were to continue throughout the remainder of their lives. But two testified that nothing was said as to the time during which the payments were to continue. As to still others the record is silent as to direct testimony in this respect.</p>
<p id="03284c29-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The payments were made regularly until June 1, 1931, when they were cut off and each of the employees previously receiving the same was advised by defendant’s personnel officer that the arrangement was terminated.</p>
<p id="03284c2a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant does not controvert many of these facts, but insists that the whole arrangement was included in a letter sent to each of the employees as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">

<p id="03284c2d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It contends and offered evidence that nothing was said to any employee about continuing the payments for his natural life; that the payments were gratuitous, continuing at the pleasure and will of defendant; that the original arrangement was not authorized, approved, or ratified by the board of directors, the executive committee thereof, or any officer endowed with corporate authority to bind the company; that there was no consideration for the promise to make the payments; and that it was beyond the power of any of the persons alleged to have contracted to create by agreement or by estoppel any liability of the company to pay wages to employees during the remainders of their lives, if they did not render actual services. Defendant admits the payments as charged and the termination of the arrangement on June 1, 1931.</p>
<p id="03284c2e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The employees assert that there was ample authority in the vice-president and general manager to make a binding contract of the kind alleged to have existed; that, irrespective of the existence or nonexistence of such authority, the conduct of the company in making payment was ratification of the original agreement and that defendant is now estopped to deny validity of the same.</p>

The witness said he expressed his preference to work, but was told that that was impossible. He says that he was told that the arrangement was permanent, that is, for as long as he lived; that he would receive a letter confirming this conversation, which he should keep; that his labor would end on July 31, 1930; that he received the letter within a day or two; that thereafter he reported regularly at the office and obtained the checks until May 29, 1931, when he was told by the personnel department that the check then received would be the last one. This action, he said he was then told, was taken because of the necessity for further retrenchment. He testified that he sought no other employment; that nothing was said to him about working or not working for other parties, and that when he received the letter he kept it without comment or objection.</p>
<p id="03287340-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other claimants testified substantially the same . . . .</p>
<p id="03287341-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In behalf of defendant, the assistant secretary testified that there were no minutes showing any corporate action with regard to the arrangement and that there was nothing in the records of the corporation, in bylaws, resolution or minutes authorizing, directing, or ratifying the payments or giving anybody authority to make the same. Anglin, vice-president and general manager in charge of manufacturing at the Lawrenceville Refinery where these men were employed, testified that he said to Kogan that, due to depressed conditions the company found it necessary to reduce expenses and lay off certain men; that it had no pension plan; that in an effort to be perfectly fair the company would keep him on the pay roll but relieve him of all duties except to pick up his check; that he said that the arrangement was voluntary with the company, and terminable at its pleasure, and that he hoped it would last during Kogan’s lifetime, but that there might be a change in the policy of the company. His testimony as to the other employees was the same. He denied promising any of them that the payments would persist so long as they lived. He sent the letters as he promised confirming the arrangement. He testified that the letters were in compliance with what he had said; that no complaint or demand for any additional provisions was thereafter made; that he himself was employed orally; that he had no written contract; that he had no authority from the directors to make the arrangement; that he hired and fired men in Lawrenceville upon <span title="123" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-123">p. 123</span>recommendation of the foreman; that a change in the management occurred when the Indian Refining Company was purchased by the Texas Company between October, 1930, and January, 1931; and that after the latter date he was not general manager at Lawrenceville . . . .</p>
<p id="03287342-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The present vice-president and general manager testified that he came into office January, 1931; and that no complaint was received by him by any plaintiff until suit was started.</p>
<p id="03287343-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus it is undisputed that a separate arrangement was made by the local office with each of the claimants, most of them on July 28, 1930, to continue them upon the pay roll, deliver to them semimonthly a check, upon their calling for same, for one-half of the former wages; that this was done until June 1, 1931. It is also undisputed that the letters sent out said nothing about how long the payments should continue but were wholly silent in that respect. It is also undisputed that insurance payments were deducted from the checks that were delivered; that the employees were retained on the pay roll; that they did no active work after August 1, 1931 [sic; 1930?]; that they received their checks as mentioned; that the payments terminated on June 1, 1931; that most of them called at the office for their checks and received same; and that in at least two instances the checks were mailed. The controverted question of fact arises upon the testimony of most of the plaintiffs that each of them was told that the payments would continue until their death. This is denied.</p>
<p id="03287344-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Let us assume, without so deciding, for the purpose of disposition of this case, that each of the employees was told that the payments would continue for his lifetime. Then the questions remaining are legal in character. The arrangement was made by no corporate officer having authority to make such a contract. Under the bylaws, corporation transactions as recorded in the minutes, there was no authorization or ratification of any such contract. It is urged, however, that by continuing to pay the checks the corporation ratified the previously unauthorized action. The facts render such conclusion dubious. I am unable to see how knowledge of the mere fact that men’s names were on the pay roll and checks paid to them could create any estoppel to deny authority, in the absence of proof of knowledge upon the part of the duly authorized officers of the company that the men were not working but were receiving in effect pensions or that they had been promised payments for life. Consequently, there was no ratification express or implied and no estoppel.</p>
<p id="03287345-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Presented also is the further question of whether, admitting the facts as alleged by plaintiffs, there was any consideration for a contract to pay a pension for life. However strongly a man may be bound in conscience to fulfill his engagements, the law does not recognize their sanctity or supply any means to compel their performance, except when founded upon a sufficient consideration. Volume 6, American &amp; English Encyclopedia of Law, p.673 (2d Ed.)</p>
<p id="03287346-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The long and faithful services of the employees are relied upon as consideration; but past or executed consideration is a self-contradictory term. Consideration is something given in exchange for a promise or in a reliance upon the promise. Something which has been delivered before the promise is executed, and, therefore, made without reference to it, cannot properly be <span title="124" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-124">p. 124</span>legal consideration. Williston on Contracts, vol. 1, §142; 13 Corpus Juris, 359; Shields v. Clifton Hill Land Co., 94 Tenn. 123, 28 S.W. 668, 26 L.R.A. 523, 45 Am. St. Rep. 700; Restatement of the Law of Contracts, vol. 1, p.88.</p>
<p id="03287347-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is further contended that there was a moral consideration for the alleged contracts. The doctrine of validity of moral consideration has received approval in some courts, but quite generally it is condemned because it is contrary in character to actual consideration . . . . Thus in Hart v. Strong, 183 Ill. 349, 55 N.E. 629, 631, the court said: “The agreement to receive less than the amount due on the note was made upon the purely moral consideration that John W. Hart, believing himself about to die, thought he ought not to have exacted so large a consideration for the reconveyance. But such an obligation does not form a valid consideration unless the moral duty were once a legal one. ‘But the morality of the promise, however certain or however urgent the duty, does not, of itself, suffice for a consideration.’ 1 Pars. Cont. 434.”</p>
<p id="03287348-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Upon the same ground, appreciation of past services or pleasure afforded the employer thereby is not a sufficient consideration . . . . So Williston says (Contracts, vol. 1, p. 230): “ . . . if there be no legal consideration, no motive, such as love and respect, or affection for another or a desire to do justice, or fear of trouble, or a desire to equalize the shares in an estate, or to provide for a child, or regret for having advised an unfortunate investment, will support a promise.”</p>
<p id="03287349-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs have proved that they were ready, willing, and able to travel to and report semimonthly to the main office. But this does not furnish a legal consideration. The act was simply a condition imposed upon them in obtaining gratuitous pensions and not a consideration. The employees went to the office to obtain their checks. Such acts were benefits to them and not detriments. They were detriments to defendant and not benefits. This is not consideration. Williston on Contracts, vol. 1, pp. 231-235, and cases cited; Restatement of Contracts, par. 75, Illus. 2.</p>
<p id="0328734a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the absence of valid agreement to make payments for the rest of their natural lives, clearly the arrangement was one revocable at the pleasure of defendant. If defendant agreed to make the payments for life, then, fatal to plaintiffs’ cases is the lack of consideration. We have merely a gratuitous arrangement without consideration, and therefore, void as a contract.</p>
<p id="03289a5b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this enlightened day, I am sure, no one controverts the wisdom, justice, and desirability of a policy, whether promoted and fostered by industry voluntarily or by state or federal government, looking to the promotion and assurance of financial protection of deserving employees in their old age. We have come to realize that the industry wherein the diligent worker labors for many years should bear the cost of his living in some degree of comfort through his declining years until the end of his life. To impose this expense upon the industry, to the creation of whose product he has contributed, is not unfair or unreasonable, for, eventually, obviously, under wise budgeting and cost accounting systems, this element of cost is passed on to the consumer of the product. The public bears the burden — as, indeed, it does eventually of all governmental expenditures and corporate costs, either in taxes or price of products purchased. Surely <span title="125" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-125">p. 125</span>no one would have the temerity to urge that such a policy is not more fair and reasonable, more humane and beneficent, than the poorhouse system of our earlier days. The recognition of the soundness of this proposition is justified by the resulting contribution to the advance of standards of living, hygienic and sanitary environment, and, in some degree at least, of culture and civilization.</p>
<p id="03289a5c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But, in the absence of statute creating it, such a policy does not enter into the relationship of employer or employee, except when so provided by contract of the parties. The court is endowed with no power of legislation; nor may it read into contracts provisions upon which the parties’ minds have not met.</p>
<p id="03289a5d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Viewing the testimony most favorably for the plaintiffs, despite the desirability of the practice of liberality between employer and employee, the court must decide a purely legal question — whether under plaintiffs’ theory there were valid contracts. The obvious answer is in the negative. Consequently, there will be a decree in favor of defendant dismissing plaintiffs’ bill for want of equity. The foregoing includes my findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>

<li class=""><p id="03289a60-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Consideration or condition?</i> The court holds in <i>Plowman</i> that the plaintiffs’ travel to the defendant’s office, to pick up their checks, did not constitute consideration; it was “simply a condition imposed upon them in obtaining gratuitous pensions.” Do you agree? Recall the court’s discussion of “legal detriment” in Hamer v. Sidway, and the “Williston’s tramp” hypothetical discussed in <i>Pennsy Supply</i>, above. Did the company receive any benefit from the plaintiffs’ actions? In Dulany Foods v. C.M. Ayers, Inc., 260 S.E.2d 196 (Va. 1979), the defendant promulgated a policy of making severance payments to employees who remained on its payroll as of a given date. In response to the company’s argument that the employees’ continued employment was only a condition, and not consideration for its promise, the Virginia Supreme Court stated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03289a61-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We observe that the memorandum, prepared by Whittington and amended and approved by MacCormack, was not executed in a vacuum . . . . The decision by Dulany to close its Eastern Shore plants and facilities was a major one for both management and employees. The livelihoods of a great number of employees in Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware were involved, and the owners had at stake a large investment in plants, equipment, and unsold food. The four months between the decision to close the plants and the time the Exmore facilities were taken over by Exmore Foods, Inc., were critical months for Dulany. Not only did the company have an unpleasant decision to make, implement, and communicate to its employees, it also had “to wind down” a vast manufacturing and refrigeration plant, an operation which included the repacking and refrigeration of millions of pounds of vegetables. Dulany needed the continued services of loyal and efficient employees to perform this task. It was vital to the company that its closing-out period be a peaceful one, and that favorable public relations and plant morale be maintained. These objectives were <span title="126" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-126">p. 126</span>accomplished . . . . The company’s termination pay policy brought it industrial peace, avoidance of unrest on the part of its employees, and consequently a smooth termination of operations.</p>
<p id="03289a62-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During the four-month span involved in this case Dulany was actively seeking a buyer for its plants. It is a matter of common knowledge that the most valuable attraction a manufacturing plant can offer a prospective purchaser is a well-trained, efficient, loyal, and contented group of employees. Dulany possessed this intangible asset, and it is reasonable to believe that it was a factor in the willingness of Exmore Foods, Inc., to purchase the plant. It is equally as reasonable to attribute the good will of the employees to the severance pay policy that was inaugurated by Dulany.</p>

The judge also dismisses (quoting Williston) the possibility that “love and respect,  . . . affection for another or a desire to do justice” could amount to consideration; “legal consideration,” he says, is necessary. It is frequently stated, however, that where bargained-for consideration is present, the fact that the promisor may have had some other motive or inducement for making the promise will not of itself defeat the agreement. See Restatement (Second) §81, and Comment <i>b.</i> Assuming that the principal motive for the defendant’s promise may have been the welfare of its senior employees, should the promise have been enforceable if any of the following had also been part of the case?</p>

Services already performed could be, at best, only “past consideration,” which is a “self-contradictory” term: Something already done cannot constitute consideration for a later promise. See also Barton v. Sclafani Investments, Inc., 320 S.W. 3d 453 (Tex. App. 2010) (all brokerage services were rendered before making of promise to pay commission; it was past consideration and promise was not enforceable). Nor can any “moral obligation” arising out of past faithful service constitute consideration, unless the “moral” duty was also a “legal” one. If this is indeed the law, <i>should</i> it be? Professor Charles Fried has argued that the making of a promise is an act that of itself creates a moral obligation that the law should respect and enforce:</p> 
<div class="epub-blockquote">

The moralist of duty thus posits a general obligation to keep promises, of which the obligation of contract will be only a special case — that special case in which certain promises have attained legal as well as moral force. But since a contract is first of all a promise, the contract must be kept because a promise must be kept.</p>

Even if you would stop short of enforcing the moral obligation implicit in <i>every</i> promise, would you as judge in <i>Plowman</i> have felt impelled to enforce the moral obligation of the Indian Refining Co.? We return later in this chapter to questions of “past consideration” and “moral obligation” as possible bases for promissory liability.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0328c17b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The issue of authority.</i> Would the plaintiffs’ legal position have been improved if the defendant’s board of directors had adopted by formal resolution a plan to pay the disputed pensions to the plaintiffs, specifically providing that such payments should continue for the lives of the discharged employees? Although his opinion is perhaps slightly unclear on the point, Judge Lindley appears to find that the promises, even if they were made, were made by agents lacking in authority to bind the defendant, and were not made binding on the defendant by later events. The issue of whether a person or organization is legally responsible for the acts of an employee is one of the issues addressed by agency law. This body of law has, like contract law, been the subject of two ALI Restatements; agency law can be, and often is, the subject of a separate law school course. Agency issues frequently arise in contract cases, however, and not every law school today offers a separate agency course. The following Comment is therefore designed to provide a brief introduction to some basic agency concepts.</p></li>

<p id="0328c17d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Agency is a consensual relationship in which one person, the agent, agrees to act on behalf of, and subject to the control of, another person, the principal. Restatement (Third) of Agency §1.01. (“Person” in this context means a “legal” person, which can include corporations as well as individuals; corporations, being artificial persons, can act only through agents.) The agency relationship is often described as “fiduciary,” because it involves a relationship of trust and confidence in which one person is bound to act in the interests of another. Id<i>.</i> §8.01. The principal’s right to control the agent is the essence of the relationship. As indicated, the agency relationship is a consensual one; it is usually created by contract between the principal and its agent, although agency may also be gratuitous.</p>

First, an agent has actual authority to take actions “designated  . . . in the principal’s manifestations.” Id<i>.</i> §2.02(1). Many courts and the former Restatement use the term “express authority” to refer to this form of authorization. Id<i>.</i> §2.01, Comment <i>b</i>. Thus, if the Board of Directors of Indian Refining Co. had passed a resolution directing its vice president to send the letters in question to the plaintiffs, those letters would in law have been sent by the company itself.</p>
<p id="0328c17f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, an agent has actual authority to take actions “implied in the principal’s manifestations.” Id<i>.</i> §2.02(1). For example, suppose the board of directors had directed the vice president to develop a plan to reduce the company’s work force to a level sufficient to maintain the company’s operations despite the economic conditions then prevailing (a national depression) with appropriate provision for payment of partial salary to any long-term employees who were laid off as part of this plan. In this case the board would not have expressly authorized the sending of these particular letters, but authority to do so might fairly have been implied from the vice president’s general mandate.</p>
<p id="0328c180-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, an agent has actual authority to perform “acts necessary or incidental to achieving the principal’s objectives.” Id<i>.</i> §2.02(1). Thus, if the board had passed a resolution authorizing the vice president to enter into contracts with long-term employees on the terms discussed in the case, the vice president would have had actual authority to sign the contracts and other documents necessary or incidental to carrying out the resolution.</p>
<p id="0328c181-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose, on the other hand, that the board had passed a resolution authorizing the vice president to develop a plan to reduce the company’s work force to a level sufficient to maintain the company’s operations despite the economic conditions then prevailing. However, suppose that in this situation the board did not specify that the vice president had authority to pay reduced salaries to workers who were laid off without any corresponding obligation by these workers to the company. In this example, the vice president might well lack actual authority to enter into the contracts involved in the case because the arrangement would probably amount to a gift by the corporation to its long-term employees. Generally, the authorization of an agent to make a gift of the principal’s property must be quite specific. Id<i>.</i> §2.02, Comment <i>h</i>.</p>
<p id="0328c182-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even in the absence of any actual authority, however, a principal may be legally bound by the actions of its agent if the principal has done or said something that leads the other party reasonably to believe that the agent does indeed have actual authority to do the act in question. Suppose that Indian Refining’s Board of Directors had ordered that a letter be sent to all employees, advising them that “Vice President Anglin will shortly be communicating with you about the way in which our company will respond to the drastic change in economic conditions, in order to assure its survival and the continued well-being of its employees.” Even if the board had made it plain to the vice president that his actual authority merely extended to the reshuffling of work shifts and the <span title="129" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-129">p. 129</span>discharge of some employees, such a letter might be held to have created in the minds of the employees a reasonable belief that he also had the authority to promise pension payments. In that case he would have had “apparent authority” to make the promises in the letters. Id<i>.</i> §2.03. See also §3.03, Comment <i>e</i> (discussing the apparent authority of organizational executives and corporate officers).</p>
<p id="0328c183-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, even where an agent has no authority at all — either actual or apparent — to enter into a particular contract on behalf of the principal, a principal that later learns of its agent’s action and approves of it will be liable on that contract by virtue of such “ratification.” Id<i>.</i> §4.01. This sort of after-the-fact approval was at issue in <i>Plowman</i>. The plaintiffs argued that the board of directors had ratified the vice president’s promises to them by continuing to make salary payments after the plaintiffs stopped work. The judge rejected that argument on the ground that effective ratification requires knowledge of all material facts; the board, he declared, could not have known merely from payroll records that the employees were no longer working or were receiving lifetime pensions. See Id<i>.</i> §4.06.</p>
<p id="0328c184-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court also referred to the notion of “estoppel,” a concept that crops up in a variety of legal contexts. (In the next chapter we will see another application of the estoppel concept in a contractual context.) Under agency law a principal may be estopped to deny that its agent’s actions were unauthorized, where the principal by words or actions caused the other to rely to his detriment on the agent’s authority to act. Id<i>.</i> §2.05. This notion is obviously very similar to that of apparent authority. Apparent authority, however, is based on the principal’s manifestations, while an estoppel could result from other acts or even inaction by the principal that place the agent in a position to lead the third party to believe that the agent has authority to act for the principal. Id<i>.</i> §2.05, Comment <i>d</i>.</p>

<p id="0328e89d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">¶ 1 Appellant George J. Dohrmann III appeals from the circuit court’s grant of summary judgment to appellee Thomas E. Swaney, independent executor of the estate of Virginia H. Rogers, deceased (the Estate), as to the two remaining counts of his complaint. These counts relate to an alleged agreement made between Dohrmann and Mrs. Rogers prior to Mrs. Rogers’ death in which Mrs. Rogers signed a document (the contract) agreeing to give Dohrmann, in part, her apartment and all of the items contained therein, as well as the sum of $4 million. Dohrmann contends on appeal that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>
<span title="130" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-130">p. 130</span>

<p id="0328e89f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">¶ 3 Dohrmann, who was Mrs. Rogers’ neighbor, filed a five-count fourth amended complaint against Thomas E. Swaney, as guardian of the Estate of Virginia Rogers, a disabled person, and as successor trustee of the Virginia H. Rogers Trust (Trust),<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN111A7_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N111A7_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">1</a></span> based on a contract dated April 1, 2000. Under the purported contract, in exchange for Dohrmann’s “past and future services,” including helping to continue the Rogers name by incorporating it into his children’s name, Mrs. Rogers agreed to convey to Dohrmann upon her death her apartment and everything within it, as well as the sum of $4 million. The contract states that Mrs. Rogers will carry out this promise through her “Will and Testament or other testamentary substitute.” Dohrmann alleged that he legally changed the names of his minor children to add the Rogers name and that he believed he had performed all his duties under the contract. Mrs. Rogers filed a counterclaim alleging that the contract was the product of fraud in the execution.</p>
<p id="0328e8a1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">¶ 4 At the time of the summary judgment disputed herein, only counts I and II remained. By count I, Dohrmann requested a declaratory judgment settling the rights of the parties under the contract and imposing a constructive trust on Mrs. Rogers’ apartment and $4 million worth of assets for the benefit of Dohrmann. By count II, Dohrmann requested a declaration that the transfer of Mrs. Rogers’ apartment to the Trust is void, the creation of a constructive trust on the apartment for the benefit of Dohrmann, or, in the alternative, a money judgment in the amount equal to the present value of Mrs. Rogers’ apartment. Mrs. Rogers’ estate then filed a one-count counterclaim, alleging that the contract was a product of fraud in the execution and asking the court to declare the contract invalid and unenforceable and to require Dohrmann to pay compensatory and punitive damages.</p>
<p id="0328e8a2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">¶ 5 Most of the background facts are not in dispute . . . . In this Background section, we consider only the facts properly before this court . . . .</p>
<p id="0328e8a3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">¶ 6 Dohrmann first met Mrs. Rogers in 1984. They lived in the same building, the Drake Tower, a cooperative apartment building, at 179 E. Lake Shore Drive. Mrs. Rogers’ apartment was substantially larger than Dohrmann’s apartment. The apartment was Mrs. Rogers’ primary residence, while Dohrmann’s apartment was not his primary residence.</p>
<p id="0328e8a4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">¶ 7 At the time they met, Mrs. Rogers was a 73-year-old widow. She had never had nor adopted any children. Dohrmann was a 40-year-old neurosurgeon, married to Dr. Helen Dohrmann. Eventually, they had two children, George IV and Geoffrey. Dohrmann and his wife are still married.</p>
<p id="0328e8a5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">¶ 8 Dohrmann and Mrs. Rogers began to socialize together more frequently in the early 1990s and served together on the board of the Drake Tower apartments. Mrs. Rogers got to know Dohrmann’s wife and children during this time. From the record, it appears Mrs. Rogers initially enjoyed Dohrmann’s attention, <span title="131" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-131">p. 131</span>but then became concerned that he was befriending her in order to get her property upon her death.</p>
<p id="0328e8a6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">¶ 9 In 1997 or 1998, Dohrmann approached Mrs. Rogers about adult adoption, suggesting that one of them adopt the other. Dohrmann testified in deposition that Mrs. Rogers often said she regretted not having any children, and Dohrmann wanted to give her the family she never had. To that end, Dohrmann consulted with an attorney, who advised him that adult adoptions could be done in Arkansas and referred him to an Arkansas attorney. In March 1998, Dohrmann traveled to Little Rock, Arkansas, and met with an attorney who specialized in adoption law. Upon learning that residency is a prerequisite for adult adoption in Arkansas, Dohrmann entered into a written lease for an apartment in North Conway, Arkansas. The adoption attorney advised Dohrmann that she needed a signed letter of engagement from Mrs. Rogers in order to proceed. However, Mrs. Rogers never submitted a signed letter of engagement to the attorney and Dohrmann never adopted Mrs. Rogers, nor was he ever adopted by Mrs. Rogers.</p>
<p id="0328e8a7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">¶ 10 In February 2000, Dohrmann met with an estate planning attorney in Chicago, inquiring what one would do if he wished to receive something in exchange for something after a person died. The attorney drafted a skeleton agreement and subsequently discussed the agreement with Dohrmann. The attorney did not, however, participate in the preparation or execution of the contract in question here.</p>
<p id="0328e8a8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">¶ 11 On April 1, 2000, Dohrmann and Mrs. Rogers, who was 89 years old at the time, signed the contract. There were no witnesses present at the signing. Mrs. Rogers did not communicate with her long-time lawyer and advisor, Mr. Swaney, regarding the contract. Mr. Swaney did not, in fact, learn of the contract until just prior to the initiation of the instant lawsuit.</p>
<p id="0328e8a9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The contract in its entirety reads:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">

<p id="0328e8ac-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In exchange for your past and future services and other good and valuable consideration (including helping the Rogers name to continue after my death by incorporating it into your children’s names), I (Virginia H. Rogers) agree to give you (George J. Dohrmann III) upon my death 1) my apartment in the Drake Tower (shares of 11-East, Drake Tower Apartments, Inc. in Chicago) and all furniture, furnishings, personal effects and other property contained within it and the elevator vestibule at the time of my death 2) the sum of four million dollars ($4,000,000.00), and so will provide in my Last Will and Testament or other testamentary substitute that may take effect upon my death (my “testamentary documents”). If my testamentary documents fail to provide you with the above, you or your estate, shall have a valid claim against my estate for such amount.</p>
<p id="0328e8ad-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is my request that you pay my friend and lawyer, Thomas E. Swaney, the sum of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) as a surprise gift from me.</p>
<p id="0328e8ae-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This agreement may not be amended, modified or canceled except by written agreement signed by you and me.

</div>
<p id="03290ec4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">¶ 12 An appraiser estimated that the value of Mrs. Rogers’ apartment as of April 1, 2000, was approximately $1,438,000. Another appraiser estimated that the value of the “furniture, furnishings, personal effects and other property contained within it and the elevator vestibule” as of April 1, 2000, was approximately $100,045.</p>
<p id="03290ec5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">¶ 13 Two months later, on June 22, 2000, Dohrmann’s two sons’ names were legally changed to include “Rogers” as one of their middle names. Their names are now George John Rogers Dohrmann IV, and Geoffrey Edward David Rogers Dohrmann. At that time, George IV was 13 years old and Geoffrey was 7 years old. In practice, the boys (now young men) use the Rogers name inconsistently. George IV used it on his high school diploma and college applications, but, according to George IV’s deposition testimony, he did not use it on his driver’s license, his student ID card, his checking account, his credit card, his high school papers, his high school exams, or his Facebook page. Geoffrey testified that he did not have a driver’s license or state identification card, but that he used the Rogers name “whenever [he] writes down [his] full name when necessary.” He testified that he used the Rogers name on his high school applications, his student ID card, and his ATM card. He did not use it on his Facebook page, but did use his two other middle names.</p>
<p id="03290ec6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">¶ 14 On April 1, 2000, the date the contract was executed, Mrs. Rogers’ estate plan consisted of her will and the Trust. Neither included at that time or any other time a provision for the benefit of Dohrmann or for any member of his family. Rather, her estate plan consisted of bequests to various friends and distant relatives aggregating several million dollars, with the remainder of the estate distributable to seven Chicago-based charities and Mrs. Rogers’ alma mater.</p>
<p id="03290ec7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">¶ 15 In November 2004, Mrs. Rogers transferred legal ownership of her apartment to the Trust, where it remains as an asset. In March 2008, an order was entered in probate court designating Mrs. Rogers a disabled person based on her suffering from moderate dementia and probable Alzheimer’s disease. She was adjudicated to be without capacity to manage her estate or financial affairs. Mr. Swaney was appointed as the guardian of her estate.</p>
<p id="03290ec8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">¶16 Dohrmann filed his original complaint in February 2007, of which only counts I and II remained at the time of summary judgment. The Estate filed its counterclaim as part of its answer. The parties then filed cross-motions for <span title="133" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-133">p. 133</span>summary judgment as to the claims against them. In its motion for summary judgment, the Estate argued that the contract should be set aside as a matter of law because the consideration was so grossly inadequate as to shock the conscience; the undisputed facts demonstrate that this inadequate consideration was accompanied by circumstances of unfairness; and the contract is unconscionable.</p>
<p id="03290ec9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . .</p>
<p id="03290eca-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">¶ 18 In 2012, the circuit court, in a memorandum order, found that the contract was not enforceable, granted the Estate’s motion for summary judgment on counts I and II, and denied Dohrmann’s motion for summary judgment on the Estate’s counterclaim. Dohrmann appeals the grant of summary judgment against him on counts I and II.</p>
<p id="03290ecb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>¶ 19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II <span class="epub-small-caps">Analysis</span></b></p>
<p id="03290ecc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">¶ 20 On appeal, Dohrmann contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment. He argues that summary judgment was improper because: (1) the value of Dohrmann’s performance, that is, his sons’ name changes, is a disputed issue of fact; (2) Mrs. Rogers’ motive for entering into the contract is a disputed issue of fact; (3) the existence of “circumstances of unfairness” in the making of the contract is a disputed issue of fact; and (4) the testimony of Rogers’ friends that Rogers believed Dohrmann was trying to get her apartment and her estate was inadmissible hearsay and should not have been considered by the court. For the following reasons, we affirm . . . .</p>
<p id="03290ecd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">¶ 22 The primary objective in contract construction is to give effect to the intent of the parties. If the contract is clear and unambiguous, the court must determine the parties’ intent solely from the ordinary and natural meaning of the language of the contract. <i>Omnitrus Merging Corp. v. Illinois Tool Works, Inc.,</i> 256 Ill. App. 3d 31, 34, 195 Ill. Dec. 701, 628 N.E.2d 1165 (1993).</p>
<p id="03290ece-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">¶ 23 The basic requirements of a contract are an offer, acceptance, and consideration . . . . The determination of whether consideration is sufficient to support a contract is a question of law for the court to decide. Valuable consideration for a contract consists of some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other . . . . <i>Steinberg v. Chicago Medical School,</i> 69 Ill. 2d 320, 330, 13 Ill. Dec. 699, 371 N.E.2d 634 (1977) (any act or promise that benefits one party or disadvantages the other is sufficient consideration to support the formation of a contract). Whether a contract contains consideration is a question of law, which we review <i>de novo  . . . .</i> “[W]here the amount of consideration is so grossly inadequate as to shock the conscience of the court, the contract will fail.” <i>Ahern v. Knecht,</i> 202 Ill. App. 3d 709, 715, 150 Ill. Dec. 660, 563 N.E.2d 787 (1990). This court has considered the issue of gross inadequacy of consideration:</p>

<p id="032935e4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">¶ 30 Here, our review of the record persuades us that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the Estate where, based on the record before us, there was no genuine issue of material fact. The circumstances existing when the contract was entered into in this case were such that the terms of the contract should be set aside where the Estate sufficiently showed the contract should be considered void due to the grossly inadequate consideration provided Mrs. Rogers from Dohrmann, as well as the unfair circumstances surrounding the contract’s creation.</p>
<p id="032935e5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">¶ 31 Under the terms of the contract, Mrs. Rogers agreed to transfer, upon her death, to Dohrmann over $5.5 million in assets in exchange for Dohrmann adding Rogers as an additional middle name to his two sons’ names, so that their names became George John Rogers Dohrmann, IV, and Geoffrey Edward David Rogers Dohrmann. We note here that, in his answers to interrogatories, Dohrmann described the consideration bargained for under the contract:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="032935e6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . Dr. Dohrmann performed by taking actions to change the names of his two sons and incorporate the Rogers name into their legal names in order to continue the Rogers name after the death of Ms. Rogers. Dr. Dohrmann initiated legal proceedings in the Circuit Court of Cook County to change the names of his sons and incorporate the Rogers name into their legal names. On June 22, 2000, George J. Dohrmann IV became legally known as George J. Rogers Dohrmann IV, and Geoffrey Dohrmann became legally known as Geoffrey E.D. Rogers Dohrmann . . . . There were and are no “future services” to be performed. At no time prior to the execution of the Contract did Ms. Rogers and Dr. Dohrmann discuss any “past” services or “future services” to be performed as part of the Contract . . . .</p>
</div>
<p id="032935e7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, therefore, the sole consideration Dohrmann agreed to give in exchange for over $5.5 million in assets was to add Rogers as an additional middle name to his sons’ names. According to the plain language of the contract, the addition of “Rogers” to the boys’ names was of value to Mrs. Rogers <span title="135" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-135">p. 135</span>because it would help the Rogers name to continue after Mrs. Rogers’ death. We address that consideration here.</p>
<p id="032935e8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">¶ 32 We agree with the Estate that Mrs. Rogers did not gain much by the addition of the Rogers name to the boys’ middle names. The stated purpose of adding the name was to “help[] the Rogers name to continue after [her] death.” However, Dohrmann did not change the boys’ surnames to Rogers, nor even exchange their middle names for Rogers. Rather, he merely added the name Rogers as one of two middle names for George IV and one of three middle names for Geoffrey. This can hardly be said to perpetuate the Rogers name after Mrs. Rogers’ death.</p>
<p id="032935e9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">¶ 33 We note here Dohrmann acknowledges it is appropriate for a court to consider whether consideration was provided in a contract, but argues that it is improper for a court to consider the relative value or adequacy of the consideration. He states: “a court may examine the consideration exchanged for several purposes, none of which, however, includes determining and/or weighing the relative value of adequacy of legal consideration exchanged.” We disagree, as, in cases like the one at bar where the consideration provided is so grossly inadequate as to shock the conscience, a court may examine the adequacy of the consideration. See, <i>e.g., Bonner v. Westbound Records, Inc.,</i> 76 Ill. App. 3d 736, 743, 31 Ill. Dec. 926, 394 N.E.2d 1303 (1979) (“It is not the function of either the circuit court or [the appellate] court to review the amount of the consideration which passed to decide whether either party made a bad bargain [Citations] <i>unless the amount is so grossly inadequate</i> as to shock the conscience of the court.” (Emphasis added)); see also <i>Ahern,</i> 202 Ill. App. 3d at 716, 150 Ill. Dec. 660, 563 N.E.2d 787.</p>
<p id="032935ea-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">¶ 34 Additionally, the contract is brief and makes no provision for when or even if the boys must actually use the name Rogers. It appears from the record before us that the boys have used the name only intermittently. Moreover, there is nothing in the contract to prevent the boys from legally removing Rogers as a middle name, particularly because they, as minors, were not parties to the contract. Where the consideration for a contract is illusory, the contract will be invalidated for gross inadequacy of consideration. See <i>Mimica,</i> 250 Ill. App. 3d at 432, 190 Ill. Dec. 67, 620 N.E.2d 1328. Although the children allegedly took the Rogers name as their own in order to perpetuate the Rogers name after Mrs. Rogers’ death, enforcing that obligation is a legal impossibility. Accordingly, the consideration to this contract is illusory.</p>
<p id="032935eb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">¶ 35 In total, pursuant to the terms of the contract, Mrs. Rogers, an elderly widow, agreed to give Dohrmann upon her death $5,538,000 in cash and property in exchange for Dohrmann adding Rogers as an additional middle name to the names of his sons in an effort to help perpetuate the Rogers name after Mrs. Rogers’ death. The contract does not contain any provision mandating how, when, or whether Dohrmann’s sons are to use the Rogers name. The disparity is shocking on its face. We agree with the circuit court, which stated that this consideration “seems to be so minimally beneficial to Mrs. Rogers (particularly in light of the goal stated in the Contract of ‘continuing the Rogers name’) as to be almost nonexistent, especially when <span title="136" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-136">p. 136</span>contrasted with the $5.5 million Dr. Dohrmann is to receive under the terms of the Contract.”</p>

<p id="032935ed-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">¶ 37 Although the inadequacy of consideration in this situation is sufficient in itself to find this contract void, we also agree with the circuit court and the Estate that there were circumstances of unfairness, that is, the extremely disproportionate bargaining power of the contracting parties, surrounding the execution of the contract to such an extent that the contract could be found void on those grounds, as well . . . . Factors relevant to this analysis include the age and education of the contracting parties. See <i>Ahern,</i> 202 Ill. App. 3d at 716, 150 Ill. Dec. 660, 563 N.E.2d 787 (“Courts will also look to such factors as the age and education of the contracting parties, their commercial experience [Citation], and whether the aggrieved party had a meaningful choice when faced with unreasonably unfavorable terms [Citations].”).</p>
<p id="032935ee-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">¶ 38 In reviewing the record before us, we have found many of the uncontested facts clearly demonstrate circumstances of unfairness surrounding the execution of the contract, that is, the parties had vastly different bargaining positions. At the time of the contract’s execution in 2000, Mrs. Rogers was an 89 year old widow whose husband had died many years previously. Two years following the execution of this contract, Mrs. Rogers was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. She had no children nor any immediate family. She was entering into a contract worth $5.5 million with Dohrmann, a physician. Mrs. Rogers had a long-time attorney and advisor, Mr. Swaney, but she did not consult him regarding the execution of this contract. She also had in place an estate plan for the event of her death.</p>
<p id="032935ef-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">¶ 39 The other contracting party, Dohrmann, is a highly educated neurosurgeon, married with a family. Under the contract, Dohrmann stood to reap a benefit worth $5.5 million. Prior to entering into the contract, Dohrmann consulted an estate planning attorney. This attorney drafted a “skeleton” agreement for him. These facts clearly show that the creation of this contract involved gross inadequacy of consideration as well as circumstances of unfairness . . . .</p>
<p id="032935f0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">¶ 45 In the instant case, the circuit court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the Estate where there was no genuine issue as to any material fact. The circuit court properly found that the contract was unenforceable.</p>

<li class=""><p id="03295d08-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>General rule that courts will not inquire into the adequacy of consideration.</i>  Closely allied to the view of consideration as reflecting the “exchange” element of a transaction is the well-established rule that, in ascertaining the presence of consideration, the courts will not “weigh” the consideration, or insist on a “fair” or “even” exchange. In his treatise, Williston put it thus: “It is an ‘elementary principle that the law will not enter into an inquiry as to the adequacy of the consideration.’ This rule is almost as old as the law of consideration itself.” Williston on Contracts §115 (1920); see also Restatement (Second) §79 (no requirement of “equivalence in the values exchanged”). This view of consideration fits comfortably with the classical view of contract as being content to leave it to the parties to set the terms of their own exchange, with the court’s role being limited to confirming that a bargain had in fact been struck.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03295d09-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Batsakis v. Demotsis</i></b><i>: an example of the general rule.</i> A leading example of the general rule that courts will not inquire into the adequacy of consideration is Batsakis v. Demotsis, 226 S.W.2d 673 (Tex. Civ. Ct. App. 1949). In that case Ms. Demotsis borrowed 500,000 of Greek currency (drachmae) from Mr. Batsakis, giving in exchange her written promise to repay Mr. Batsakis US$2000 plus 8% interest. Demotsis made the promise to obtain money “for the support of my family during these difficult days and because it is impossible for me to transfer dollars of my own from America.” After the war Batsakis sued Demotsis in Texas to collect on the promise; she defended claiming that the 500,000 drachmae were worth only US$25. The Texas Court of Appeals rejected defendant’s pleas of “want of consideration,” “failure of consideration,” and “inadequacy of consideration.” The first two pleas did not apply because the defendant received 500,000 drachmae and this was exactly what she bargained for. As to the third plea the court held: “Mere inadequacy of consideration will not void a contract.” Thus, the court did not require equivalence in the exchange.</p>
<p id="03295d0a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is the following background relevant to the <i>Batsakis</i> case? If so, how? In the spring of 1941, German, Italian, and Bulgarian forces invaded and occupied Greece, taking control of food and medical supplies. The Allies imposed a naval blockade that restricted supplies to Greece throughout the winter of 1941-1942, and the Germans systematically looted the country; the result was a devastating famine that killed many thousands of Greeks during that period, possibly as many as 40,000 in the Athens-Piraeus area alone. Rampant inflation during the same period drove the price of bread from 70 drachmas to 2,350. See generally Mark Mazower, Inside Hitler’s Greece 23-41, 65-67 (1993).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03295d0b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Exceptions to the general rule.</i> Courts, like the Illinois Appellate Court in <i>Dohrmann</i>, have on rare occasion refused to enforce agreements by finding either no consideration or grossly inadequate consideration. A well-known older example is Newman &amp; Snell’s Bk. v. Hunter, 220 N.W. 665 (Mich. 1928), where the court refused to enforce a widow’s promise to pay the debt of her deceased husband in exchange for the bank’s surrender of his promissory note when the note would not have been collectible anyway because the estate was insolvent.</p>
<p id="03295d0c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="138" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-138">p. 138</span>An approach that is sounder doctrinally considers the adequacy of consideration along with other factors in determining whether to apply one of several doctrines dealing with defects in the bargaining process, particularly fraud, duress, and unconscionability. The Restatement (Second) points out in Comment e to §79 that “gross inadequacy of consideration may be relevant” to the application of other doctrines, such as fraud, mistake, lack of capacity, duress, or undue influence. Could this approach have been used in <i>Dohrmann?</i> In <i>Bataskis v. Demotsis?</i> In Chapter 7 we will examine when various forms of bargaining misconduct could invalidate a contract.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03295d0d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Hypothetical variation of</i> <b><i>Dohrmann.</i>
</b> As a departure from the general rule regarding consideration, the result in <i>Dohrmann</i> is likely to be highly dependent on the facts of that particular case. Suppose that Dohrmann had in fact been a blood-relative of Mrs. Rogers (a nephew — the son of her late sister), and that when Dohrmann’s wife bore their first child, a baby girl, Mrs. Rogers promised the Dohrmanns (in a signed writing — perhaps a letter of congratulations) that if they named the child “Virginia Rogers Dohrmann,” Mrs. Rogers would pay for the first year of the child’s education at a private school. Suppose further that their child indeed was given the name Virginia Rogers Dohrmann, but when the time came for her to begin her education, Mrs. Rogers declined to make any financial contribution to her $5,000 tuition in a private elementary school. Should the Dohrmanns have a valid claim against Mrs. Rogers? Cf. Schumm v. Berg, 231 P.2d 174, 185 (Cal. 1951) (mother’s naming child after its father, prominent movie actor Wallace Beery, sufficient consideration for his promise to provide for child financially).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03295d0e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>“Quitclaim deed” as example of the general rule.</i> Sometimes a party attempting to establish a clear title to real property may promise to pay another person who appears possibly to have some conflicting claim, for the delivery of a “quitclaim” deed — an acknowledgment that the person executing the deed has no ownership interest in the property in question. In such a case, the promisee may in fact have no interest at all, and may not even claim to have one, but the documentation of that fact is potentially valuable to the promisor. E.g., Lindy Lu LLC v. Illinois Central RR. Co., 984 N.E.2d 1171 (Ill. App. Ct. 2013); Restatement (Second) of Contracts §74(2).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="03295d0f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Change in the law’s concern for fairness?</i> Some scholars have argued that the movement to a bargain theory of consideration in the 19th century showed a shift from away from an earlier willingness to police the “fairness” of bargains and toward a view of contract particularly adaptable to commercial activity where the parties determine contract price based on their appraisal of market conditions. See Morton Horwitz, The Transformation of American Law, 1780-1860, at 917-927 (1977). Other writers have differed sharply with Horwitz and his colleagues over the extent to which classical contract law did indeed represent a change from earlier law in this respect. See, e.g., Alfred W. B. Simpson, The Horwitz Thesis and the History of Contracts, 46 U. Chi. L. Rev. 533 (1979). Whether the exchange-based view of consideration did indeed make a sharp break with the past, or merely undergo a change in emphasis, it does at least appear to be particularly consistent with a society in which the law fully <span title="139" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-139">p. 139</span>supports a “free market” economy, permitting commercial entities (individuals or corporations) to make whatever agreements of exchange they wish, at whatever relative values they can agree to, with the backstop of legal enforceability.</p></li>

<p id="03298426-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Bill Baker, former president of Marshall Durbin Food Corporation, brought suit against his former employer to enforce an agreement which would provide him with five years of monthly compensation equal to his monthly salary while employed. The Chancery Court of Wayne County, Mississippi, held the contract to be valid and ordered Marshall Durbin Food Corporation to pay Mr. Baker in accordance with the terms of the contract, beginning September 10, 2001. Marshall Durbin Food Corporation appealed. We affirm in part and reverse and render in part.</p>

<p id="03298428-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Baker began working as a management trainee for Marshall Durbin Food Corporation (“the Company”) in 1965 and ascended through the ranks until, in October of 1998, Mr. Baker was elected to the Company board of directors; he also held the position of vice president, live production.</p>
<p id="03298429-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Company was in troubled times. Grain prices had gone through the ceiling, and poultry prices had dropped. The Company experienced a loss of approximately thirty million dollars. Disagreements between Marshall Durbin, Jr. (“Mr. Durbin”), who owned approximately 80% of the Company stock, and his two daughters, Elise and Melissa, who owned or controlled about 18% of the stock, caused a great deal of tension in the Company. The minutes of the October 1998 stockholders meeting reflect that Elise and Melissa Durbin were not re-elected to the board because of “disruptions due to the forcing of employees to take sides and matters having been discussed in meetings with employees that should have been resolved in private between family members.” Mr. Durbin announced that he would recommend that the new board not re-elect his daughters to their position as co-presidents of the company; in the directors meeting which followed, Elise and Melissa Durbin were not elected as officers of the Company.</p>
<p id="0329842a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the months which followed, several valuable employees, including Mr. Baker, expressed concern regarding the uncertainty of their future with the Company if anything ever happened to Mr. Durbin. The Company’s sole witness, John Perri, described this period as “chaos” and testified that Mr. Baker “kind of was put in the breach to help save the company, because we were spiraling downward. [Baker] spoke to me one time and he said  . . . we’ve got to get everybody back working together and save this company  . . . I know there is a risk that, God forbid, that something happens  . . . the girls come back with the <span title="140" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-140">p. 140</span>company, the people could lose their job; and I’m going to go to [Mr. Durbin] and see if these key people  . . . can get a year’s retirement so in the event they come in and you lose your job, at least you’ve got a year to look for another job  . . . .”</p>
<p id="0329842b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In response to this concern, Mr. Durbin offered an “agreement of termination and/or early retirement” to three high level Company employees, one of whom was Mr. Baker.

<p id="0329ab4d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are presented with the issue of whether a valid contract was formed between the Company and Mr. Baker. The Company claims the contract is invalid for lack of consideration. Consideration is, of course,  . . . required for the existence of a valid contract. <i>See Rotenberry v. Hooker, 864 So. 2d 266, 270 (P13) (Miss. 2003)</i>. The Mississippi Supreme Court has defined “consideration for a promise as ‘(a) an act other than a promise, or (b) a forbearance, or (c) the creation, modification or destruction of a legal relation, or (d) a return promise, bargained for and given in exchange for the promise.’ ” <i>City of Starkville v. 4-County Electric Power Assoc., 819 So. 2d 1216, 1220 (P10) (Miss. 2002)</i> (quoting <i>Lowndes Coop. Ass’n v. Lipsey, 240 Miss. 71, 126 So. 2d 276, 277 (1961)</i> (quoting Restatement of Contracts §75 (1932))).</p>
<p id="0329ab4e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>A. What is the Effect of the Contract’s Recital of Consideration?</b></p>
<p id="0329ab4f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Failure of consideration is an affirmative defense. <i>Daniel v. Snowdoun Ass’n, 513 So. 2d 946, 950 (Miss. 1987)</i>; <i>Miss. R. Civ. Pro. 8(c)</i>. “Where the instrument in controversy contains a statement or recital of consideration, it creates a rebuttable presumption that consideration actually existed.” <i>Daniel, 513 So. 2d at 950</i>; <i>Estate of Smith v. Samuels, 822 So. 2d 366, 370 (P13) (Miss. Ct. App. 2002)</i>. While the presumption does not preclude the defendant from putting on proof designed to show that the consideration was not actually paid, his “rebuttal must be made by a clear preponderance of the evidence.” The trier of fact resolves any conflicting evidence. <i>Daniel, 513 So. 2d at 950</i>.</p>
<p id="0329ab50-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the instant case, the contract in controversy expressly recites “consideration of Ten and No/100 Dollars ($10.00) and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of all of which is acknowledged  . . . .” At trial, neither party offered any evidence to confirm or rebut the presumption of consideration which arises from this recitation . . . . While the unrebutted presumption is sufficient to affirm the decision of the chancellor as to the existence of consideration, we will, nevertheless, address the arguments raised by the Company.</p>

<p id="0329ab52-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Company argues that the contract was not supported by consideration because the promises by both Mr. Baker and the Company were illusory. First, the Company alleges that Baker’s promise to refrain from seeking other employment and forbearance from leaving the Company renders the promise illusory and thus cannot provide consideration. Second, the Company argues that its absolute right to terminate Baker’s employment with the Company at any time renders the promise illusory because it is conditioned upon something completely within the Company’s control. Also, the Company argues that the promises of both Mr. Baker and the Company were illusory because their <span title="143" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-143">p. 143</span>relationship was unquestionably at-will. Although we find the Company correct in its contention that no valid promise was given by Mr. Baker in exchange for the Company’s promise of payment, we reject the contention that the Company’s promise was also illusory. Accordingly, Mr. Baker could, and did, supply consideration for the Company’s promise by “an act other than a promise.” <i>See City of Starkville, 819 So. 2d at 1220 (P10)</i>; <i>Lowndes Coop. Ass’n, 126 So. 2d at 277</i>.</p>
<p id="0329d263-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Mississippi Supreme Court has relied on Professor Corbin’s analysis of illusory promises as consideration, which states:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="0329d264-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By the phrase “illusory promise” is meant words in promissory form that promise nothing; they do not purport to put any limitation on the freedom of the alleged promisor, but leave his future action subject to his own future will, just as it would have been had he said no words at all . . . . A prediction of future willingness is not an expression of present willingness and is not a promise. To see a promise in it is to be under an illusion. We reach the same result if B’s reply to A is, “I promise to do as you ask if I please to do so when the time arrives.” In form this is a conditional promise, but the condition is the pleasure or future will of the promisor himself. The words used do not purport to effect any limitation upon the promisor’s future freedom of choice. They do not lead the promisee to have an expectation of performance because of a present expression of will. He may hope that a future willingness will exist; but he has no more reasonable basis for such a hope than if B had merely made a prediction or had said nothing at all. As a promise, B’s words are mere illusion. Such an illusory promise is neither enforceable against the one making it, nor is it operative as a consideration for a return promise.</p>

<p id="0329d265-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Krebs ex rel. Krebs v. Strange, 419 So. 2d 178, 182-83 (Miss. 1982)</i> (quoting 1 Corbin, <i>Contracts,</i> §145 (1 vol. ed. 1952)). Applying this analysis, we determine that no valid promise was given by Mr. Baker in exchange for the Company’s promise of payment, however, we reject the contention that the Company’s promise was illusory.</p>
<p id="0329d266-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The contract expressly disavows any intent “to create contractual employment” between the Company and Mr. Baker; in fact, the parties agreed that Mr. Baker would be an “employee-at-will.” By executing the contract, Mr. Baker did not promise to remain in the Company’s employ; at trial, Mr. Baker admitted, “I could have quit at any time.” The trial court recognized this fact: “Well, as I review the contract, I don’t think he was obligated to continue to be an employee of Marshall Durbin . . . . Probably not. But, as long as he did continue to be an employee of Marshall Durbin, and any of those triggering events occurred while he was an employee of Marshall Durbin, then the contract went into effect.” Accordingly, the trial court based its finding of consideration not upon any <i>promise</i> by Mr. Baker to continue to work for the Company but upon Mr. Baker’s <i>act</i> of continuing to work for the Company and the Company’s corresponding <i>receipt of benefit</i> from Mr. Baker’s services. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has recognized that “the presence of an illusory promise does not destroy the possibility of a contract. Instead, it may create a unilateral contract, and ‘the promisor who made the illusory promise can accept [it] by performance.’” <i>Olander v. Compass Bank, 363 F.3d 560, 565 (5th Cir. <span title="144" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-144">p. 144</span>2004)</i> (quoting <i>Light v.

<p id="0329d267-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Company did not promise to continue to employ Mr. Baker for any definite period of time; however, it did promise that <i>if</i> Mr. Baker continued his employment until the happening of a triggering event, the Company would compensate him as set forth in the contract. The Company’s promise was contingent; it was not illusory. Mr. Baker apparently trusted Mr. Durbin and was willing to continue his employment at the will of Mr. Durbin. Had Mr. Durbin terminated Mr. Baker’s employment prior to the occurrence of one of the triggering events, Mr. Baker would have had no recourse. The contract was not designed to, and did not, provide for that occurrence. This case comes to us, however, after the contingency (Mr. Baker’s employment upon the happening of a triggering event) has been fulfilled; and the Company’s promise to pay under these circumstances is not illusory.</p>
<p id="0329d268-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Baker’s consideration for the Company’s promise was not by a return promise, but by “an act other than a promise.” <i>See Lowndes Coop. Ass’n, 126 So. 2d at 277</i> . . . . In the instant case, the Company focuses only on the alleged return promise of Mr. Baker and ignores the fact that other consideration, such as Mr. Baker’s actual performance, is equally sufficient consideration . . . .</p>
<p id="0329d269-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>D. Is the Contract Unenforceable if Based on Baker’s Forbearance from Seeking Other Employment?</b></p>
<p id="0329d26a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Company contends that Baker’s forbearance from seeking other employment was not a legal detriment and cannot constitute consideration. Legal detriment, as opposed to detriment in fact, is present where the promisee gives up something he was privileged to retain prior to the contract. <i>See</i> 1 Williston, <i>Contracts</i> §§102A, 382 (3d ed. 1957); <i>Lowndes Coop. Ass’n, 126 So. 2d at 278</i>. The Company argues that Mr. Baker had no legal duty to refrain from looking for other employment, and, therefore, did not suffer legal, as opposed to factual, detriment. Further, the Company contends that forbearance from seeking other employment is not legal detriment in the context of at-will employment contracts. Mr. Baker argues that his detriment consisted of his refraining from seeking other employment and his commitment to the Company at a time when the Company was in a volatile environment. We need not decide this issue. The trial court found not only detriment to Mr. Baker in forbearing from seeking or accepting other employment, but also benefit to the Company in retaining Mr. Baker’s services.</p>
<p id="0329d26b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Again, <i>Lowndes Coop. Ass’n</i> is instructive: “A benefit to the promisor <i>or</i> detriment to the promisee is sufficient consideration for a contract. This may consist <i>either</i> in some interest, right, profit or benefit accruing to the one party, <i>or</i> some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other.” <i>126 So. 2d at 278</i> (emphasis added); <i>see also Iuka Guar. Bank v. Beard, 658 So. 2d 1367, 1372 (Miss. 1995)</i> (“consideration is sufficient if there is any benefit to the promisor or any loss, detriment, or inconvenience to the promisee”).</p>
<p id="0329d26c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After reviewing the record, we find as the trial court did, that the Company benefitted by retaining the services of Mr. Baker. Marshall Durbin intended to maintain a secure work environment for his high level management team <span title="145" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-145">p. 145</span>during a turbulent time. In his bench opinion, the chancellor found Mr. Durbin’s business decision to execute such a contract was wise given the fact that the Company was in trouble and Mr. Durbin’s daughters were circulating correspondence that was causing concern among top level employees with respect to job security. Mr. Perri testified that Mr. Baker was “put in the breach to help save the company, because we were spiraling downward.” Approximately two years later, Elise Durbin, in petitioning for conservatorship of her father, estimated his stock in the Company to be worth $40,000,000. We find that the trial court’s assumption “that they turned things around during that period of time and got the company on a profitable  . . . footing” to be supported by the record. The Company has never challenged, and in fact completely ignores, the finding that the Company enjoyed the benefits of retaining a valued employee. The trial court correctly determined there to be consideration for the contract, and we affirm.</p>

<li class=""><p id="0329f984-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Recital of consideration.</i> The <i>Marshall Durbin</i> court notes that the contract contains a recital of consideration, and that under Mississippi law this would create a “rebuttable presumption” of consideration that the opposing party would have to refute. Recall that there was also a recital of consideration in the <i>Dougherty</i> case. Ultimately, both courts take a similar approach in ascertaining whether there was actual consideration present. Does it seem correct that courts should not accept an assertion of consideration in the written contract as being conclusive?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0329f985-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Defining consideration</i>. The <i>Marshall Durbin</i> court initially defines consideration as “an act other than a promise, a forbearance, the creation, modification or destruction of a legal relation, or a return promise, bargained for and given in exchange for the promise.” The court later searches for either a detriment suffered by Baker or some benefit conferred to the Marshall Durbin Corporation that would make enforceable the promise to pay Baker’s salary <span title="146" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-146">p. 146</span>for five years. Is the court’s approach to consideration consistent with the Restatement (Second) §71 definition? The <i>Marshall Durbin</i> court also makes a distinction between a “legal detriment” and “a detriment in fact.” Although the phrasing may be unfortunate, do you understand the point the court is making? How would this court classify the detriment suffered by the nephew in Hamer v. Sidway? When we study promissory estoppel in Chapter 3, we will note again these different types of “detriment.”</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0329f986-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The problem of “illusory” promises.</i> Restatement (Second) §77, Comment <i>a</i>, provides that a promise, even if bargained for, will not serve as consideration if it is “illusory” — if it makes performance entirely optional with the promisor. One basis for a promise being deemed illusory is when the agreement is “at will”; i.e., the promisor reserves the right to terminate the agreement with the promisee at any time without any period of notice to the promisee. Note, however, that even a slight restriction on the ability to escape the contract can be enough to avoid illusoriness. See Devine v. Notter, 753 N.W.2d 557 (Wis. Ct. App. 2008) (real estate contract that allowed cancellation by either party based upon attorney disapproval of terms within five-day window was not illusory). In <i>Marshall Durbin,</i> the contracting parties made it clear in the written contract that the employment was “at will” and therefore either party could terminate at any time. Yet the court found that while Baker made no commitment to remain with the company, the Marshall Durbin Corporation did make a “contingent” commitment through the offer of a unilateral contract. Were you persuaded by the court’s analysis? Is it consistent with our discussion of unilateral contracts earlier in this chapter?</p>
<p id="0329f987-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You should be aware, however, that other courts may on similar facts find that an illusory promise by one party does render the return promise unenforceable, unless some other consideration is present. Compare E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Claiborne-Reno Co., 64 F.2d 224 (8th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 290 U.S. 646 (1933) (manufacturer’s promise to continue distributorship operation not supported by consideration when distributor was free to terminate arrangement at any time), with Bruzesse v. Chesapeake Exploration, LLC, 998 F. Supp. 2d 663 (S.D. Ohio 2014) (terms of leasing agreement enforceable against lessors; agreement not illusory because although company’s obligation to proceed qualified by its satisfaction with title and susceptibility to development “in its sole discretion,” implied duty of good faith applied to limit company’s exercise of discretion). Cf. Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon, in Chapter 6.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0329f988-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>“Mutuality of obligation.”</i> In a similar vein to the illusory promise concept, sometimes courts have subjected contracts to a “mutuality of obligation” test, usually articulated as “both parties must be bound or neither is bound.” As a broad generality, that is clearly an overstatement: We already have seen that unilateral contracts lack mutuality; a promisee under a unilateral contract is free to perform or not, while the promisor becomes bound once the promisee tenders a beginning of performance. Recall Note 3 after the <i>Sateriale</i> case. As we shall see, other promises are also enforceable by a party who is not herself bound to performance in return. (E.g., as discussed in the next chapter, a promise enforceable because of “detrimental reliance” will protect the relying <span title="147" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-147">p. 147</span>promisee even though there is no commitment on her part.) The Restatement (Second) strongly asserts the absence of any “mutuality of obligation” test for contract enforcement; if the consideration requirement is met, it declares, that is enough. Restatement (Second) §79(c). Nevertheless, some courts continue to apply a “mutuality of obligation” test for enforceability. E.g., Pick Kwik Food Stores, Inc. v. Tenser, 407 So. 2d 216 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1981) (gasoline company could not enforce agreement for operation of pump on food store’s premises where company had right to remove pump at any time); McCalment v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., 860 N.E.2d 884 (Ind. Ct. App. 2007) (alleged promise by employer that unfavorable performance review would be removed from employee’s file within one year was unenforceable due to lack of mutuality of obligation; employee did not commit to do anything or refrain from anything in return).</p></li>

<p id="0329f98b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the previous sections of this chapter we explored two of the traditional basic requirements for formation of a contract: mutual assent and consideration. While thus far we have dealt primarily with the common law rules for contract formation, in this section our focus turns to corresponding statutory rules under Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC, or the Code). See the Comment on the History of the UCC that follows.</p>
<p id="0329f98c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A fundamental aspect of the UCC is that it is not a traditional “code” in the sense that it displaces all prior law in the area. See John E. Murray, Jr., Murray on Contracts 21 (5th ed. 2011). The UCC provides in §1-103(b) that preexisting principles of law and equity supplement the Code unless they are displaced by particular provisions of the Code. Consistent with that approach, the drafters did not attempt to compose an exhaustive set of contract formation rules in Article 2. Rather, the common law rules provide a backdrop against which the UCC makes only a limited number of changes. For example, the UCC does not redefine the concept of consideration, nor does it contain a definition of an offer. Those elements of contract formation would be dependent on the relevant state’s common law rules. The changes to formation rules that the Code does make are largely reflected in §§2-201 through 2-210. The following cases and materials consider a number of the issues that can arise under those sections.</p>

<p id="0329f98d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>Comment on the History of the Uniform Commercial Code</i></b></p>
<p id="0329f98e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Code had its origins in the late nineteenth century, when rapid industrialization and the growth of a national commercial economy first highlighted the expense, inconvenience, and uncertainty occasioned by differences between the states in matters of commercial law. Led by New York, a number of states created a National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) to address these problems. Although it did not have the power to make law, the NCCUSL drafted and recommended to the state legislatures a series of ‘‘uniform acts,’’ dealing with various commercial matters, such as <span title="148" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-148">p. 148</span>sales, negotiable instruments, and bills of lading. These uniform acts assumed the existence of an underlying body of common law governing contract formation in general.</p>
<p id="0329f98f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By 1940, it appeared that an updating of a number of uniform acts was in order. As that project proceeded, however, it grew into something rather different. Joining with the American Law Institute (a prestigious and influential organization of lawyers, judges, and law teachers) that had drafted Restatements of the Law, the NCCUSL produced a general revision and consolidation of all the existing uniform commercial laws, the Uniform Commercial Code. Professor Karl Llewellyn was the architect of the UCC and the principal drafter of Article 2, its Sales article. Reflecting his influence, the Code attempted to harmonize commercial law with business practice, so as to effectuate the legitimate expectations of those engaged in business dealings. Although its acceptance by the states was at first slow in coming, all or part of the UCC has been adopted and is now in force in every American state.</p>
<p id="0329f990-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The UCC, like contract law in general, has not been static. In 1987, a new Article 2A was adopted, dealing with leases of goods (a topic that many courts deemed to be covered, if at all, only “analogically” by Article 2, Sales). Various articles of the UCC have been comprehensively revised since the Code’s widespread adoption in the 1960s, some, such as Article 9, more than once. In 2001, a revised version of Article 1 was promulgated by ALI/NCCUSL and it has been adopted by a clear majority of the states. Efforts to revise Article 2 have been marked by controversy surrounding the development of electronic contractual transactions, and have not been successful. That story is told by one of the Reporters of the proposed revised article, Richard E. Speidel, in Revising Article 2, A View from the Trenches, 52 Hastings L.J. 607 (2002).</p>

<div id="0329f991-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="032a20a2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56">1.&nbsp;Mutual Assent Under the Uniform Commercial Code</p></h3></div>

<p id="032a20a3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The following cases provide our first extensive exposure to Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Before reading the cases below, a brief introduction to Article 2 may be useful. (See also the Editors’ Note to the UCC in the supplement.)</p>
<p id="032a20a4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of the first issues you must consider in analyzing a contracts problem is whether the transaction is governed by Article 2 of the UCC. It deals with transactions in “goods.” UCC §2-102. Goods are generally defined as “movable” property, such as a car or a computer. UCC §2-105(1). Article 2 does <i>not</i> apply to other types of transactions; for example it does not apply to contracts for the sale of real estate, contracts to provide services, or contracts to lease goods. (UCC Article 2A, which has many provisions similar to Article 2, governs contracts for the leasing of goods; like Article 2, it also has been adopted in every state except Louisiana.) Article 2 also does not cover contracts involving patents, trademarks, or other intellectual property; although property of this type may be referred to as “personalty” (i.e., not “realty”), it is not tangible goods. Its provisions are supplemented by the general provisions of UCC Article 1, which (unless otherwise stated) apply to all the articles of the Code.</p>
<p id="032a20a5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="149" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-149">p. 149</span>Despite the UCC’s title (a “commercial” code), Article 2 <i>does</i> apply to both consumer and commercial sales of goods. Thus, if a consumer buys an automobile from a dealer (a consumer-merchant contract), Article 2 applies. If an airline corporation buys a jet airplane from the manufacturer or a dealer (a merchant-merchant contract), Article 2 applies. If an individual person buys a bicycle from its owner at a yard sale (a consumer-consumer contract), Article 2 definitely applies also, even though in that transaction neither party is a “merchant,” as the UCC defines that term. (UCC §2-104(1).) Students often make the mistake of assuming that Article 2 does not apply unless all of the parties to the contract are merchants. Article 2 would govern all three types of contracts described above, absent specific language in a particular section that limits the application of that section to merchants. (There are some UCC sections that are so limited; we will see examples of such “merchant rules” later in these materials.)</p>
<p id="032a20a6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if Article 2 applies to a particular contract, this does not mean that common law principles are necessarily irrelevant to its enforcement. As we noted earlier, the drafters of Article 2 wrote against a common law background. To the extent that Article 2 specifically deals with a problem, then Article 2 controls. But, as provided in UCC §1-103(b), if Article 2 does not cover an issue, then courts and lawyers will turn to common law principles to resolve the matter.</p>
<p id="032a20a7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sometimes a contract will involve both the sale of goods and the transfer of something other than goods, such as services, intangible rights, or real property. For example, when you take your car to be serviced, the dealer typically will sell you certain goods, such as oil to lubricate the car or replacement parts. In addition, the dealer charges you for the labor to repair the vehicle. Does the UCC apply to such a transaction with a mixture of goods and services? You can probably think of several possible approaches to this issue. We will return to this subject in connection with the cases that follow in this chapter.</p>
<p id="032a20a8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if Article 2 clearly applies to a transaction, other statutory law may also govern the contract. For example, if a consumer buys an automobile from a dealer, Article 2 applies to the sale, but various consumer protection statutes may also apply. Section 2-102 clearly states that it does not displace consumer protection laws. A lawyer representing a consumer who purchased an automobile that turns out to be a “lemon” would want to be sure to uncover all possible claims the consumer might have under common law as well as any federal and state statutes that may regulate the transaction.</p>

<p id="032a20b1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs operated a business, Festival Foods, which served concessions to the general public at festivals and events throughout Illinois and Indiana from late April to late October each year. The assets of the business included a truck and servicing trailer and equipment such as refrigerators and freezers, roasters, chairs and tables, fountain service and signs and lighting equipment.</p>
<p id="032a20b2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants were interested in purchasing the concession business, met several times with plaintiffs, and observed the business in operation. Gene testified that on August 13, 2005, plaintiffs entered into an oral agreement to sell Festival Foods to defendants for $150,000. For the $150,000, defendants would receive the truck and trailer, all necessary equipment, and the opportunity to work at event locations secured by plaintiffs. Defendants paid $10,000 immediately, with the balance to be paid when defendants received their loan money from the bank. Defendants took possession of Festival Foods the next day and operated Festival Foods for the remainder of the 2005 season. Gene acknowledged that the insurance and titles to the truck and trailer remained in his name because he had not yet received the purchase price from defendants.</p>
<p id="032a20b3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Louann acknowledged testifying during a deposition that an oral agreement to purchase Festival Foods for $150,000 existed but later testified she could not recall specifically making an oral agreement on any particular date. Lindsey testified she and Louann met with plaintiffs on August 13, 2005, and paid the $10,000 for the right to continue to purchase the business because plaintiffs had another interested buyer. She also stated that the parties agreed defendants would run Festival Foods as they pursued buying the business. According to Lindsey, Gene suggested the parties sign something and she replied that defendants were “in no position to sign anything” because they had not received any loan money from the bank and did not have an attorney. The following week, Lindsey consulted with an attorney regarding the legal aspects of buying and owning a business. She asked the attorney to prepare a contract for the purchase. Ultimately, the bank approved defendants for a loan. Lindsey admitted taking possession of Festival Foods, receiving the income from the business, purchasing inventory, replacing equipment, paying taxes on the business and paying employees.</p>
<p id="032a47c4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants operated six events, three in Indiana and three in Illinois. Gene attended the first two festivals in Valparaiso and Auburn, Indiana, with defendants, who paid him $10 an hour and paid for his lodging. Gene and Louann testified that plaintiffs’ minimal involvement with the operations after August 13 was merely as advisors to defendants, who were unfamiliar with this type of business. Two days after the business season ended, defendants returned Festival Foods to the storage facility where it had been stored by Gene. Gene testified he had canceled his lease with the storage facility, telling the owner that he had sold his business. Someone at the storage facility called Gene and reported that Festival Foods had been returned. Thereafter Gene attempted to sell Festival Foods, but was unsuccessful. Lindsey testified one of the re	asons defendants returned Festival Foods was because the income from the events they operated was lower than expected. She stated Gene specifically asked defendants to run certain events for him and he ran the events where he was <span title="151" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-151">p. 151</span>present. She testified Gene asked for the trailer back, stating he needed it “so he could make money on it for the end of the year,” and that Gene stated he did not have money to buy back the inventory.</p>
<p id="032a47c5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court first held that the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)  . . . governed the issues raised in this case, rejecting defendants’ argument that a sale of goods was not involved. The trial court then found that there was a contract formed but that the evidence was insufficient to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that there was a meeting of the minds as to what that agreement was. “If this is an agreement to reach an agreement, I suspect that the action for the price must fail.”</p>

Magee v. Garreau, 332 Ill. App. 3d 1070, 1076, 774 N.E.2d 441, 446, 266 Ill. Dec. 335 (2002). In general, the construction or interpretation of a contract is a matter to be determined by the court as a question of law. Avery v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 216 Ill. 2d 100, 129, 835 N.E.2d 801, 821, 296 Ill. Dec. 448 (2005).</p>

<p id="032a47c9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants argue the UCC should not apply because this case involves the sale of a business rather than just the sale of goods. The “predominant purpose” test is used to determine whether a contract for both the sale of goods and the rendition of services falls within the scope of article 2 of the UCC . . . . A contract that is primarily for services, with the sale of goods being incidental, will not fall within the scope of <i>Article 2</i>. Belleville Toyota, Inc. v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., 199 Ill. 2d 325, 352-53, 770 N.E.2d 177, 194-95, 264 Ill. Dec. 283 (2002) . . . . Certainly significant tangible assets were involved in this case. Cf. Fink v. DeClassis, 745 F. Supp. 509, 516 (N.D. Ill. 1990) (intangible assets accounted for $1 million of the total purchase price of $1.2 million). The evidence presented in this case was sufficient to support the conclusion that the proposed agreement was predominantly one for the sale of goods.</p>

</div>
<p id="032a47d1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants argue that nothing was said in the contract about allocating a price for good will, a covenant not to compete, allocating a price for the equipment, how to release liens, what would happen if there was no loan approval, and other issues. Defendants argue these are essential terms for the sale of a business and the Internal Revenue Service requires that parties allocate the sales price. “None of these items were even discussed much less agreed to. There is not an enforceable agreement when there are so many essential terms missing.”</p>
<p id="032a47d2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“A contract may be enforced even though some contract terms may be missing or left to be agreed upon, but if the essential terms are so uncertain that there is no basis for deciding whether the agreement has been kept or broken, there is no contract.” Academy Chicago Publishers v. Cheever, 144 Ill. 2d 24, 30, 578 N.E.2d 981, 984, 161 Ill. Dec. 335 (1991). In <i>Cheever</i>, the widow of John Cheever signed an agreement to publish a collection of Cheever’s short stories. <i>Cheever</i>, 144 Ill. 2d at 27, 578 N.E.2d at 982. The Illinois Supreme Court held there was no valid and enforceable contract because there was no agreement as to the length and content of the book, who would decide which stories to include, the criteria used by the publisher in determining whether the manuscript was “satisfactory,” or other terms. <i>Cheever,</i> 144 Ill. 2d at 29-30, 578 N.E.2d at 984. “[I]n fact, all they had really agreed to was a tentative title (<i>The Uncollected Stories of John Cheever</i>).” See also Dawson v. General Motors Corp., 977 F.2d 369, 373 (7th Cir. 1992).</p>
<p id="032a47d3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The essential terms were agreed upon in this case. The purchase price was $150,000, and the items to be transferred were specified. No essential terms remained to be agreed upon; the only action remaining was the performance of the contract. Defendants took possession of the items to be transferred and used them as their own. “Rejection of goods must be within a reasonable time after their delivery or tender. It is ineffective unless the buyer seasonably notifies the seller.” 810 ILCS 5/[UCC§]2-602(1) (West 2004). Defendants paid $10,000 of the purchase price. The fact that defendants were disappointed in the income from the events they operated is not inconsistent with the existence of a contract.</p>
<p id="032a47d4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court noted that “the parties have very very different views about what transpired in the course of the contract[-]formation discussions.” It is not necessary that the parties share a subjective understanding as to the terms of the contract; the parties’ conduct may indicate an agreement to the terms. Steinberg v. Chicago Medical School, 69 Ill. 2d 320, 330-31, 371 N.E.2d 634, 640, 13 Ill. Dec. 699 (1977). The conduct in this case is clear. Parties discussing the sale of goods do not transfer those goods and allow them to be retained for a substantial period before reaching agreement. Defendants replaced equipment, reported income, paid taxes, and paid Gene for his time and expenses, <span title="153" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-153">p. 153</span>all of which is inconsistent with the idea that defendants were only “pursuing buying the business.” An agreement to make an agreement is not an agreement, but there was clearly more than that here.</p>
<p id="032a47d5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court believed it was significant that Lindsey told Gene that defendants were “in no position to sign anything” because they had not received any loan money from the bank and did not have any attorney. “The fact that a formal written document is anticipated does not preclude enforcement of a specific preliminary promise.” <i>Dawson,</i> 977 F.2d at 374 (1992). Defendants’ loan was eventually approved, they did consult with an attorney, and defendants remained in possession of and continued to operate Festival Foods. The parties’ agreement could have been fleshed out with additional terms, but the essential terms were agreed upon. Louann admitted there was an agreement to purchase Festival Foods for $150,000 but could not recall specifically making an oral agreement on any particular date. “An agreement sufficient to constitute a contract for sale may be found even though the moment of its making is undetermined.” 810 ILCS 5//[UCC§]2-204(2) (West 2004). Returning the goods at the end of the season was not a rejection of plaintiffs’ offer to sell, it was a breach of contract.</p>

<li class=""><p id="032a6eec-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> <i>Applicability of common law or UCC Article 2.</i> The <i>Jannusch</i> court must first consider whether the dispute is a type which comes within the scope of Article 2 of the UCC or should be governed by the common law. Although brief, the court’s discussion correctly sets forth the “predominant thrust” test that courts have commonly applied to this type of question. Moreover, most case law would support the court’s conclusion that the primary purpose of this contract was the sale of goods, rather than transfer of intangible assets related to the sale of the business (e.g., goodwill, booking contracts or training in business procedures). The <i>Princess Cruises</i> case in the next section will present a similar question concerning a contract with a mixture of goods and services.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="032a6eed-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Contract formation under the UCC</i>. We have seen that under common law principles a contract requires a bargain in which there is a manifestation of mutual assent. UCC Section 2-204(3), however, places a clear emphasis on the question whether the parties had an intent to be bound even if some terms were left open. Under this Article 2 standard, does it appear that the parties <span title="154" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-154">p. 154</span>formed a contract based on the facts in the <i>Jannusch</i> case? How do these principles compare to the common law principles we examined earlier?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="032a6eee-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Oral contracts and the statute of frauds</i>. The buyers in <i>Jannusch</i> argued that any alleged contract would not be enforceable because it was not in a signed writing. As we noted in the introductory materials in Chapter 1, virtually every state has enacted “statute of frauds” provisions that require certain contracts to be reduced to writing to be fully enforceable. A contract for the sale of goods for the price of $500 or more must comply with the writing requirement of UCC §2-201 or fall within an exception. The contract in <i>Jannusch</i> was not in a signed writing but came within two of those exceptions. Chapter 4 examines the requirements of the UCC statute of frauds in more detail. It is sufficient for you to know at this point that a contract that fails to satisfy the writing requirement in some cases may still be enforceable.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="032a6eef-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The effect of relaxed rules for contract enforcement under the UCC?</i> Does the “relaxed” approach to contract formation under the UCC favor sellers or buy-ers? In Jannusch the court found that a contract was formed even though many terms were left open, thus imposing liability on the buyers. A similar case is Lowe v. Smith, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS (Tenn. Ct. App.) (finding the buyers liable for breach of an oral agreement to purchase a convenience store even though there was no discussion of the amount of gasoline inventory to be included in the sale or whether the sale also covered the real estate where the store was located). Of course, a flexible approach to contract formation does not mean that a court will always find that a contract was formed. See Sun City Pet Mkt., LLC v. Honest Kitchen, Inc., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78278 (D. Ariz.) (dismissing plaintiff’s complaint for breach of contract when it alleged that plaintiff had ordered pet products based on “Special” prices defendant had posted online to potential buyers attending a commercial show for sellers of pet products) and the case that follows.</p></li>

<p id="032a9606-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span class="epub-small-caps">Flaum</span>, Circuit Judge. E.C. Styberg Engineering Co. (“Styberg”) sued Eaton Corp. (“Eaton”), claiming that it breached a contract to buy 13,000 transmission components from Styberg. After a bench trial, the district court found that no contract existed and entered judgment for Eaton. Styberg appeals, and, for the following reasons, we affirm.</p>
<p id="032a9607-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>I. <span class="epub-small-caps">Background</span></b></p>
<p id="032a9608-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Styberg manufactures custom components for other manufacturers, and Eaton manufactures, among other things, motor vehicle parts and accessories, including transmissions. From 1998 to 2000, Styberg manufactured Part No. A-6871, an Inertia Brake Assembly (“I-brake”), for Eaton’s six-speed transmissions. In August 1998, Styberg began selling prototype I-brake units to Eaton, and, in <span title="155" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-155">p. 155</span>November, Eaton began purchasing limited quantities of I-brakes so it could test the product in the marketplace. Subsequently, Eaton decided to pursue full production of I-brakes, and, in 1999, the parties began negotiating an agreement under which Styberg would produce large quantities of I-brakes for Eaton.</p>
<p id="032a9609-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As negotiations proceeded, John Baker, Styberg’s Engineering and Quality Assurance Manager, kept in contact with two Eaton employees: Al Davis, an engineer, and Lisa Fletcher, Eaton’s buyer.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN116D0_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N116D0_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">2</a></span> On May 27, 1999, Davis sent Baker an e-mail expressing Eaton’s willingness to make a minimum purchase commitment to Styberg. Davis stated,</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="032a960b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I know that Styberg wants a commitment for a minimum number of units that Eaton will buy (to protect Styberg’s capital expenditures). I believe Eaton is willing to give Styberg that commitment as well . . . . At the very least, I believe Eaton will guarantee the number of units it takes to pay off your capital investments, however many that is. (like the 13,000 we were discussing before) . . . .</p>
</div>
<p id="032a960c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Getting a minimum unit commitment from Eaton was important to Styberg because, as Davis’ e-mail suggests, Styberg had to expend significant capital to mass-produce the custom-designed parts.</p>
<p id="032a960d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On July 8, 1999, Baker sent Fletcher a proposal for a 60,000 unit order. According to the proposal, the first 13,000 units sold would have an average price of $544.88. The initial price of the units would be $595, but the price would progressively decrease as Styberg tweaked and perfected its manufacturing process. The proposal contained additional conditions, including a re-evaluation of the price and delivery schedule after the first 6,000 units were produced and an additional $31 per unit charge until a certain snap-in coil became available for manufacturing. Furthermore, the proposal requested $343,000 in “tooling money” — money that would assist Styberg in acquiring materials for its customized production. It also stated that Styberg would begin full production of the I-brakes in six months.</p>
<p id="032a960e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In his telephone log from July 16, 1999, Baker wrote, “Lisa Fletcher Quote was received. We have the 13,000 order!” A few days later, on July 22 and 23, Davis was visiting Styberg and met with its Vice President of Manufacturing, Ron Jones. Jones asked Davis for Eaton’s commitment to buy at least 60,000 units, or, in the alternative, to buy 20,000 units with an additional capital investment of $1.2 million. Davis did not respond to the request while he was on site. On July 26, he e-mailed Fletcher, noting that Styberg representatives had indicated that they needed “a larger total unit commitment [than 13,000]” before the company would increase its monthly production capacity.</p>
<p id="032a960f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a letter to Baker dated July 29, 1999, Fletcher wrote:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="032a9610-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Enclosed please find a tooling commitment . . . . [W]ith this $293,000 investment Styberg will be able to produce assembly A-6971 at a rate of up to 1,400 units per month, with an approximate lead time of four months.<span title="156" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-156">p. 156</span></p>
<p id="032a9611-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Eaton will purchase a minimum of 13,000 units at an average unit price of $544.88 by July 29th, 2001. Additional requirements will be based on the market competitiveness and product value as the initial 13,000 units are consumed . . . .</p>
</div>
<p id="032a9612-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On August 9, 1999, Baker and Fletcher spoke on the telephone and Baker told Fletcher, “thank you.” According to Baker, he said “thank you” to indicate to Fletcher that Styberg agreed to produce the minimum quantity at the average price. However, Baker’s notes from the phone call say, “13,000 units doesn’t cover [Styberg’s capitalization for the project]  . . . 25 to Ron’s 30,000.” During cross-examination, Baker acknowledged that the notation meant that Styberg’s Vice President of Manufacturing wanted a 25,000 to 30,000 unit commitment.</p>
<p id="032a9613-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On September 1, 1999, employees from both companies participated in a conference call. Fletcher’s notes from the call state, “we commit to 13K units — Styberg sez [sic] not enough to justify their capital investment. Want at least 30K commitment . . . . Styberg will come back w/ capacity + quotes for 13K flat out.” According to Baker, the parties to the conference call agreed that, in regard to the 13,000 unit order, Baker would prepare a schedule for Fletcher that detailed the number of units Styberg could produce each month with its present capital.</p>
<p id="032a9614-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On September 9, 1999, Baker sent Fletcher a production schedule that included a detailed break-down of Styberg’s anticipated monthly production capacity for 13,000 units as well as a quote for an initial unit price of $595 plus $31 per unit until the snap-in coil became available. The quote stated that the estimated delivery date would “be based on a starting date four months after an agreement on casting design, unit price, and delivery schedules.” Baker testified that on September 27, 1999, Fletcher told him that the schedule was acceptable. However, Baker’s notes from September 27 include the notation “LM,” which, according to earlier testimony, meant that he left a message for Fletcher and did not speak with her.</p>
<p id="032a9615-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Eaton did not issue a specific purchase order for the 13,000 I-brakes, but Baker contends that Fletcher told him to use an existing purchase order. Styberg did not execute or send Eaton a purchase order acknowledgment for the 13,000 unit order. In April 2000, Eaton notified Styberg that it expected delivery of 240 units. Styberg shipped the units under an existing purchase order, and Eaton paid for the units. On May 8, 2000, Eaton requested another 240 units for shipment, which were to be delivered the following month. Three days later, however, Eaton cancelled the request. After May 11, 2000, Eaton neither ordered nor paid for any I-brakes. In May 2003, after settlement discussions broke down, Styberg sued Eaton in the district court for breach of contract, seeking approximately $3.4 million in damages, which represented Styberg’s lost profits and inventory related to the manufacture of 13,000 I-brakes.</p>
<p id="032a9616-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After a four-day trial, the district court entered judgment in favor of Eaton, summarizing the case as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="032a9617-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Based on the record, the Court finds that there was not a contract. Styberg could not meet and refused to accept any of the proposed terms. It needed additional money for tooling. It could not meet the monthly production targets <span title="157" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-157">p. 157</span>set in the letter and purchase order. It needed to increase the unit price to cover design changes. It needed a higher total number of unit sales to cover its expenses. Finally, it needed more lead time and needed to extend the timetable by nearly a year. The parties never came to like terms of any kind of agreement. When asked of the Plaintiff to point to what constituted the agreement, Plaintiff was not able to do so in a manner that even came close in a legally satisfactory manner. For a company that did business on the written word of contracts, they were unable to produce one.</p>
</div>
<p id="032abd28-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The district court characterized the e-mail, telephone, and letter exchanges as evidence of continuing negotiations in which the parties could not agree on key terms like quantity, price, and monthly production volume. Accordingly, it concluded that the parties never formed a contract. Styberg appeals.</p>
<p id="032abd29-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>II. <span class="epub-small-caps">Discussion</span></b></p>
<p id="032abd2a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On appeal, Styberg claims that the district court’s factual findings and legal conclusions were erroneous, and that this Court should enter judgment in its favor. We review the trial court’s determination that no contract existed for clear error. See Thomas v. Gen. Motors Acceptance Corp., 288 F.3d 305, 307 (7th Cir. 2002) . . . .</p>
<p id="032abd2b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ohio Revised Code §1302.07(A), the state’s codification of UCC §2-204, provides that “a contract for the sale of goods may be made in any manner sufficient to show agreement, including conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of such a contract.” Courts and commentators agree that the UCC takes a liberal view towards what is required to create a contract for the sale of goods. See, e.g., Architectural Metal Sys., Inc. v. Consol. Sys., Inc., 58 F.3d 1227, 1230 (7th Cir. 1995) (recognizing that the UCC tolerates “a good deal of incompleteness and even contradiction in offer and acceptance”); WHITE AND SUMMERS, UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE §1-2 at 4-5 (4th Ed. 1995) (noting that Article 2 of the UCC makes contracts easier to form by reducing the required formalities);  . . . . Notably, however, nothing in the UCC or Ohio’s code eliminates the requirement that, for a contract to be enforceable, it “must  . . . be specific as to its essential terms, such as the identity of the parties to be bound, the subject matter of the contract, consideration, a quantity term, and a price term.” Alligood v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co., 594 N.E.2d 668, 669 (Ohio Ct. App. 1991).</p>
<p id="032abd2c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, Styberg argues that the documentary evidence conclusively established the existence of a contract and that the district court erred in finding that no contract was formed. According to Styberg, the parties agreed that Eaton would purchase 13,000 I-brakes from Styberg at an average unit price of $544.88. Styberg identifies three possible sources for the alleged contract: 1) Lisa Fletcher’s July 29, 1999 letter; 2) Baker’s September 9, 1999 schedule; and 3) Eaton’s request for I-brakes in the Spring of 2000.</p>
<p id="032abd2d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, Styberg argues that Lisa Fletcher’s July 29 letter was either an acceptance of Styberg’s July 8 offer to supply Eaton with 13,000 I-brakes or an offer to purchase I-brakes that Baker accepted on August 9, 1999 by saying “thank you.” Then, according to Styberg, although the parties had a contract with <span title="158" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-158">p. 158</span>the price and quantity terms firmly in place, they continued to negotiate about larger orders and other open terms. Eaton, on the other hand, characterizes Lisa Fletcher’s letter as part of a series of ongoing negotiations, during which Eaton and Styberg could not agree on the essential terms. Eaton claims that Styberg wanted a commitment for some 20,000 to 60,000 I-brakes in order to justify its capital investment, and Eaton did not want to be bound by such a large commitment.</p>
<p id="032abd2e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our view, the district court did not err by concluding that the communications were ongoing negotiations about a contract that never came to fruition rather than an actual contract. Indeed, the court’s decision was supported by relevant case law, which states that typically, a price quotation is considered an invitation for an offer, rather than an offer to form a binding contract. See Dyno Constr. Co. v. McWane, Inc., 198 F.3d 567, 572 (6th Cir. 1999) (applying Ohio law). If Styberg’s July 8 price quotation was not an offer, then the July 29 letter could not have been an acceptance. Moreover, “it is most often the buyer’s purchase order, submitted in response to such a quotation that constitutes the offer.” Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co. v. Hitachi Am., Ltd. 406 F. Supp. 2d 819, 827 (N.D. Ohio 2005). The parties agree that Lisa Fletcher did not send Styberg a purchase order for 13,000 I-brakes.</p>
<p id="032abd2f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even assuming that Fletcher’s letter was an offer in response to the price quotation, the district court’s finding that Styberg rejected the offer and continued to push for a higher minimum-unit commitment was a reasonable interpretation of the evidence. After Baker allegedly manifested his acceptance by saying “thank you” on August 9, the two companies participated in a conference call during which Styberg again indicated that a 13,000 unit commitment was not enough. Baker’s own notes from the September 1 call state that September 15 was “ ‘D’ Day agreement,” presumably meaning the parties had not yet formed a contract on September 1.</p>
<p id="032abd30-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Next, Styberg argues that a contract was formed on September 27, 1999, when Fletcher told Baker that his proposed schedule from September 9 was acceptable. We reject this argument as well. The district court found that Fletcher never made such a comment, and that finding was not clearly erroneous. The court emphasized that Baker’s own notes from September 27 indicated only that he left a message for Fletcher, suggesting that he never spoke with her at all. Because the district court’s conclusion was supported by its assessment of Baker’s credibility as well as the documentary evidence, we are in no position to second-guess it.</p>
<p id="032abd31-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, Styberg contends that the parties’ conduct clearly demonstrated the existence of a contract. We disagree. The district court found that Eaton’s request for two 240-unit orders at the price specified in Styberg’s quotes was insufficient to prove an agreement for the sale of 13,000 units, and that conclusion was not clearly erroneous. Although one Ohio court has required a buyer who accepted $5,500 worth of cable to accept all $35,000 worth of it, the buyer in that case had sent the seller a purchase order for the full amount, which the seller accepted by shipping the goods. TLG Elecs, Inc. v. Newcome Corp., 2002 Ohio 882, 2002 WL 338203, at *3 (Ohio Ct. App. 2002). Here, by <span title="159" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-159">p. 159</span>contrast, Eaton did not submit a purchase order for 13,000 I-brakes, so accepting the 240-unit shipment did not require it to accept 13,000.</p>
<p id="032abd32-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, courts finding contracts based on parties’ conduct have typically done so either where there was repeated and ongoing conduct manifesting an agreement or where the parties had an established course of dealing to which they adhered. See, e.g., Central Transp., Inc. v. Cleveland Metallurgical Supply Co., No. 63055, 1993 Ohio App. LEXIS 3513, 1993 WL 266924, at *2-3 (Ohio Ct. App. July 15, 1993) (holding that the parties’ conduct manifested an agreement where the buyer submitted a purchase order, the seller shipped coal to the buyer on numerous occasions, the buyer paid for each shipment, and the parties continued to do business even after a dispute arose between them); [American Bronze Corp. v. Streamway Prods., 8 Ohio App. 3d 223, 456 N.E.2d 1295, 1300 (Ohio Ct. App. 1982)] (finding a binding contract was formed where the parties followed their usual procedures for placing and accepting orders). In this case, Eaton’s two requests for 240 I-brakes, one of which was cancelled, did not come close to the repeated, ongoing dealing that proved a contract in <i>Central Transport</i>, nor did it adhere to the parties’ usual course of dealing as in <i>American Bronze</i>. In fact, if the parties intended to contract, they deviated from their usual procedure because, historically, Eaton would submit a specific purchase order to Styberg and Styberg would send Eaton a purchase order acknowledgment form. Therefore, the district court properly could have concluded that Eaton placed the orders pursuant to the parties’ previous arrangement dating back to 1998 rather than a new contract for 13,000 units.</p>
<p id="032abd33-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In short, the district court accepted Eaton’s interpretation of ambiguous evidence and its choice between two reasonable interpretations of that evidence was not clearly erroneous. See Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S. Ct. 1504, 84 L.

<li class=""><p id="032abd38-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Offer and acceptance under UCC Article 2.</i> As indicated in the <i>E.C. Styberg</i> case as well as in the <i>Jannusch</i> opinion, Section 2-204 liberalizes the rules for contract formation under Article 2. Subsection 2-204(2) states that “a contract for sale may be found even though the moment of its making is undetermined.” The official comment to the section further underscores this approach: “Subsection (2) is directed primarily to the situation where the interchanged correspondence does not disclose the exact point at which the deal was closed, but the actions of the parties indicate that a binding obligation has been undertaken.” Are you persuaded by the seller’s argument in <i>E.C. Styberg</i> that the parties reached an agreement for the sale of 13,000 units of the goods <span title="160" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-160">p. 160</span>even though they continued to negotiate for a larger quantity? Did the court expect too much in stating that the absence of a written purchase order from the buyer and purchase order acknowledgment from the seller indicated that a contract had not been made?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="032ae449-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Same rule, different outcomes?</i> The courts in two preceding cases rely on the same UCC provisions. Can the finding that a contract was not made in <i>E.C. Styberg</i> be reconciled with the decision that a contract was made in <i>Jannusch?</i> What are the key factual differences between the two cases?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="032ae44a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Acceptance through conduct.</i> Consistent with Section 2-204, the Code goes on to provide in Section 2-206(1) that unless the offeror “unambiguously” indicates how acceptance should be made, “an offer to make a contract shall be construed as inviting acceptance in any manner and by any medium reasonable in the circumstances.” Do you think that the buyer in <i>E.C. Styberg</i> ever made an offer that the seller might have accepted?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="032ae44b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Agreement despite open terms</i>. Recall that the court in the <i>Quake Construction</i> case earlier in this chapter recognized that parties might have a binding agreement despite the fact that some terms still were subject to negotiation and, alternatively, that the concurring opinion in that case recognized that parties might have a binding agreement to negotiate in good faith even though a contract had not been finalized. Would either of those arguments be relevant to the <i>E.C. Styberg</i> case?</p></li>

<p id="032ae44d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have previously referred several times to the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG), an international treaty to which the United States is a party. It is useful to think of the CISG as the international equivalent to Article 2 of the UCC. If a contract has international aspects, one of the first issues you must analyze is whether the CISG applies. For further discussion of the CISG see the Editors’ Note to the CISG in the supplement.</p>
<p id="032ae44e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Scope.</i> Just as the court in the <i>Jannusch</i> case had to first address the question whether UCC Article 2 would apply to the transaction at issue, it is inherent in the nature of the CISG as a treaty that it applies only to those transactions that come with the scope of its provisions. The CISG states rather simply in Article 1 that it “applies to contracts for the sale of goods” in phrasing similar to the UCC Article §2-102 provision that it applies to “transactions in goods.” Beyond that initial point, however, the CISG scope provisions depart in significant ways from those of Article 2.</p>
<p id="032ae44f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An initial difference between the UCC and the CISG is that the latter treaty generally applies to contracts for the sale of goods when the contracting parties have places of business in different countries that are signatories to the CISG. See Article 1(a). For a list of signatory countries, see the Editors’ Note to the CISG in the supplement. Most of the United States’ major trading partners, with the exception of the United Kingdom, are parties to the CISG. Thus, if a Chinese garment manufacturer sells goods to a New York department store, the contract would be subject to the CISG. Keep in mind, however, that many <span title="161" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-161">p. 161</span>foreign companies establish U.S. subsidiaries. A contract between a U.S. subsidiary of a Chinese company and a U.S. company would not be subject to the CISG.</p>
<p id="032ae450-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A second difference between the two law sources is that the UCC Article 2 applies to sales of goods to consumers, while the CISG excludes consumer transactions. See Article 2(a). This exclusion covers goods that are bought for a “personal, family, or household use.” Thus, a U.S. national who travels to a European country to purchase an automobile for family use will not have made a transaction that comes within the scope of the CISG.</p>
<p id="032ae451-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is also significant that parties to an international contract that is otherwise subject to the CISG may by contract agree that the CISG does not apply and that some other source of law governs. See Article 6. Under the UCC the parties may, subject to some limitations, vary the provisions by agreement, but the parties do not have the power to exclude the application of the UCC entirely. UCC §1-302.</p>
<p id="032b0b62-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professor John Coyle conducted a study to determine the extent to which large U.S. companies rely on the CISG in their international agreements. After examining actual contracts from U.S. companies and interviewing U.S. lawyers who draft and negotiate contracts with foreign parties, Professor Coyle found that U.S. companies routinely exclude the CISG from their international sales agreements and almost never intentionally select it as the governing law, at least partly due to lack of familiarity with the CISG. He concluded that the CISG has yet to achieve much traction among large U.S. companies doing business internationally. John F. Coyle, The Role of the CISG in U.S. Contract Practice: An Empirical Study, 38 U. Pa. J. Int’l L. 195 (2016). These observations may be read to highlight a need for more study of the CISG by U.S. lawyers.</p>
<p id="032b0b63-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Contract formation under the CISG</i>. The provisions on formation under the CISG bear many similarities to the UCC and U.S. common law, speaking in terms of offer and acceptance. Article 14 defines an offer as a proposal addressed to one or more specific persons that is sufficiently definite as to the goods involved, the quantity, and the price and that indicates a willingness to be bound if the offeree accepts. In a similar vein to the prevailing U.S. rule on advertisements, Article 14(2) states that a proposal sent to multiple addressees is most likely an invitation to make offers rather than an offer itself. Ultimately, Article 23 provides that a contract is concluded, or formed, when an effective acceptance is made.</p>
<p id="032b0b64-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are a number of other provisions under the CISG relevant to contract formation. Throughout the following materials we will address a number of those CISG articles as well as provisions addressing the performance and enforcement of international contracts for the sale of goods.</p>

<p id="032b0b67-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Marsha Boyston is an investor who specializes in acquiring income producing real estate, such as office buildings and apartment projects. In the typical transaction, Boyston does the following: locates desirable property, assembles <span title="162" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-162">p. 162</span>a group of individuals who will invest in the project (these investors usually put up 20 percent of the purchase price), and obtains bank financing for the remaining 80 percent of the purchase price. For her services Boyston usually receives 10 percent ownership in the project.</p>
<p id="032b0b68-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recently, Boyston negotiated a contract with Herbert Smith, the owner of the Village Garden Apartments, to acquire the property for $1.5 million. She paid Smith $25,000 down. The contract contains a standard “financing contingency” clause, which provides that Boyston will not be obligated to purchase the property if she is unable to obtain financing. If she cannot obtain financing, however, she forfeits the $25,000 down payment.</p>
<p id="032b0b69-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After signing the contract, Boyston went to the National Bank of City and applied for a loan of $1.2 million (80 percent of the purchase price). On September 24, 2018, she received the following loan commitment letter from Andrea Wilson, the loan officer at National:</p>

<p id="032b599b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While the bank was evaluating the loan, Boyston had been busy contacting business acquaintances who had invested in her previous projects. By the time she received the commitment letter, she had obtained promises from investors for $200,000 of the $300,000 that she needed. After receiving the above letter, she continued her efforts, and by October 1, she had put together a group of eight investors willing to put up $300,000. She immediately contacted Herbert Smith, the owner of the Village Garden apartments, and informed him that she had obtained financing. They agreed to a closing date of October 28, 2018. She also called Ms. Wilson at the bank to tell her that she wished to accept the terms of the bank’s loan. Boyston told Wilson that she would personally deliver the signed commitment letter the next day. Later that afternoon, however, Wilson called Boyston and told her that she had just received word from her boss that the bank was withdrawing its commitment letter. Boyston was shocked. She pointed out that she had already told Wilson that she had agreed to the loan. Wilson was very apologetic. Wilson said that she didn’t even know the reason why the bank was withdrawing its commitment. Boyston then contacted Smith to inform him of the problem. She asked Smith if he would be willing to agree to an extension of the closing. Smith said he would, but only for two weeks. During that time Boyston tried to obtain other bank financing, but was unable to do so. She finally had to tell Smith that she was unable to go forward with the sale. As a result she forfeited her $25,000 deposit.</p>

<p id="032b599f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If our experience is any guide, it may be that for law students in general, the notion of a “contract” conjures up the image of a sort of all-purpose document, full of legal jargon — whereases, heretofores, and parties of the first and second part — that experienced lawyers know by heart. In fact, the “legal ritual” part of most contracts is negligible or nil; the heart of a written contract is an accurate description of the particular exchange of performances to which the parties are agreeing, plus an identification of the principal risks entailed for one or both parties, with specification of the parties’ rights should any of those risk-events occur.</p>
<p id="032b59a0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is not to say there are not “legal forms” for contract lawyers to employ; models can be found in “form books” in law libraries and many companies <span title="164" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-164">p. 164</span>publish computer software with forms for various types of transactions. But the suggested forms vary with each type of transaction, and the language used in such forms reflects the practicalities of the business in question as well as the rules of law that govern it. Most lawyers who practice extensively in a particular commercial area develop their own set of forms, or “precedents” — model contracts that are used over and over in substantially the same form. Typically these contain at least some language that is almost always repeated verbatim (often referred to as “boilerplate”); other parts will be varied to suit the particular transaction. Of course, no careful lawyer would use a prior contract as a precedent without reviewing it to see what changes might be required. A cautious reliance on precedents is standard practice, however, and for good reason: It saves the lawyer’s time and labor; it thereby helps keep down the cost of legal services to the client; and it provides the attorney with a checklist of things to watch out for in the transaction at hand. The use of computers with word processing programs and other “apps” has made the adaptation of standard forms to the specifics of each transaction much easier.</p>
<p id="032b7fb1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For many clients, this use of prototype contracts can be carried a step further. Most businesses enter into a large number of substantially similar transactions — sales of goods, for instance, in which the typical variations are the type, number, and price of the items sold, the name of the buyer, the time and place agreed on for delivery, and whether the buyer wishes to purchase a service contract and/or an extended warranty. For such repetitive transactions, use of a series of individually prepared contracts (even if developed with the time-saving help of precedents) would be inefficient. What is needed is a “standard form,” a pre-prepared document that gives all the legal protection required in a particular type of transaction, with blanks to be completed either by selling personnel or with information supplied by the purchaser in on-line transactions.</p>
<p id="032b7fb2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From the lawyer’s point of view, such forms are important principally as a means of bringing legal counsel to bear in multiple transactions that would otherwise have to be conducted without it. To the client, however, the forms have additional utility. Because they serve as efficient organizers of information, they facilitate storage and retrieval of the data important to particular transactions. Standard forms also permit relatively error-free dissemination of identical information to the various persons within and without the organization who have responsibility for different aspects of the completed exchange. On the other hand, we all know from experience that the efficiency gained from the use of standardized forms is likely to be purchased at the cost of some depersonalizing of the individual transaction. If the forms do not completely replace personal contact and negotiation, but only supplement it, their use creates an additional potential risk: that the transaction as recorded will differ from the transaction-in-fact, perhaps in important ways.</p>
<p id="032b7fb3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We noted earlier in this chapter that the traditional rules of contract law were fashioned on the assumption that the parties would deal with each other in the conventional manner: An offer would be made; it would be either accepted or rejected; if the latter, perhaps a counteroffer would be made; that in turn would be accepted or rejected; and so on. Certainly that mode of contracting may still <span title="165" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-165">p. 165</span>be employed today. But for most businesses, such a leisurely approach to contracting is too expensive and time-consuming to be taken for any but the most important and idiosyncratic of transactions. Most deals will be made — or at least recorded — on forms, either paper or electronic. Courts and legislatures have therefore had to fashion new rules for determining when sufficient agreement has been reached to justify a finding that a contract has been made and for deciding in light of the various communications between the parties what the terms of that contract are.</p>
<p id="032b7fb4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The materials in this section will be devoted to the situation where the parties are business enterprises utilizing paper forms of the type described above. The first case, Princess Cruises, Inc. v. General Electric Co., although it involves issues of federal law, turns in the end on a pair of common law principles established in the heyday of classical contract law: the “mirror image” and “last shot” rules, as they are often called. The following cases, <i>Brown Machine</i> and <i>Paul Gottlieb</i>, illustrate the different approach taken by UCC Article 2 to the question of nonmatching forms, as spelled out in UCC §2-207.</p>

<p id="032ba6cd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This suit arises out of a maritime contract between General Electric Company (GE) and Princess Cruises, Inc. (Princess) for inspection and repair services relating to Princess’s cruise ship, the SS <i>Sky Princess.</i> In January 1997, a jury found GE liable for breach of contract and awarded Princess $4,577,743.00 in damages. J.A. at 1876. On appeal, GE contends that the district court erred in denying its renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law, which requested that the court vacate the jury’s award of incidental and consequential damages. Specifically, GE argues that the district court erroneously applied Uniform Commercial Code principles, rather than common-law principles, to a contract primarily for services. We agree and hold that when the predominant purpose of a maritime or land-based contract is the rendering of services rather than the furnishing of goods, the U.C.C. is inapplicable, and courts must draw on common-law doctrines when interpreting the contract. Accordingly, we reverse the district court’s decision denying GE’s renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law and remand for modification of the judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>

<p id="032ba6cf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Princess scheduled the SS <i>Sky Princess</i> for routine inspection services and repairs in December 1994 and requested that GE, the original manufacturer <span title="166" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-166">p. 166</span>of the ship’s main turbines, perform services and provide parts incidental to the ship’s inspection and repair. Princess issued a Purchase Order in October 1994. The Purchase Order included a proposed contract price of $260,000.00 and contained a brief description of services to be performed by GE. The reverse side of the Purchase Order listed terms and conditions which indicated that Princess intended the Purchase Order to be an offer. These terms and conditions also stated that GE could accept the Purchase Order through acknowledgment or performance; that the terms and conditions could not be changed unilaterally; and that GE would provide a warranty of workmanlike quality and fitness for the use intended. J.A. at 75-76.</p>

<p id="032ba6d3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the same day that GE received the Purchase Order, GE faxed a Fixed Price Quotation to Princess. The Fixed Price Quotation provided a more detailed work description than Princess’s Purchase Order and included a parts and materials list, an offering price of $201,888.00, and GE’s own terms and conditions. When GE reviewed Princess’s Purchase Order, it discovered that Princess requested work not contemplated by GE in its Fixed Price Quotation. GE notified Princess of GE’s error. On October 28, 1994, GE faxed a Final Price Quotation to Princess. In the Final Price Quotation, GE offered to provide all services, labor, and materials for $231,925.00. Attached to both GE Quotations were GE’s terms and conditions, which: (1) rejected the terms and conditions set forth in Princess’s Purchase Order; (2) rejected liquidated damages; (3) limited GE’s liability to repair or replacement of any defective goods or damaged equipment resulting from defective service, exclusive of all written, oral, implied, or statutory warranties; (4) limited GE’s liability on any claims to not more than the greater of either $5000.00 or the contract price; and (5) disclaimed any liability for consequential damages, lost profits, or lost revenue. J.A. at 106-13. During an October 31, 1994 telephone call, Princess gave GE permission to proceed based on the price set forth in GE’s Final Price Quotation. J.A. at 825, 1850.</p>
<p id="032ba6d4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On November 1, 1994, GE sent a confirmatory letter to Princess acknowledging receipt of Princess’s Purchase Order and expressing GE’s intent to perform the services. J.A. at 115. The letter also restated GE’s $231,925.00 offering price from its Final Price Quotation and specified that GE’s terms and conditions, attached to the letter, were to govern the contract. Id.</p>
<p id="032ba6d5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the SS <i>Sky Princess</i> arrived for inspection, GE noted surface rust on the rotor and recommended that it be taken ashore for cleaning and balancing. The parties agree that during the cleaning, good metal was removed from the rotor, rendering the rotor unbalanced. Although GE attempted to correct the imbalance, Princess canceled a ten-day Christmas cruise as a result of delays caused by the repair. At trial, Princess alleged that the continued vibration and <span title="167" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-167">p. 167</span>high temperatures caused damage to the ship, forcing additional repairs and the cancellation of a ten-day Easter cruise. It was undisputed, however, that Princess paid GE the full amount of the contract: $231,925.00. J.A. at 1008.</p>
<p id="032ba6d6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On April 22, 1996, Princess filed a four-count complaint against GE, alleging breach of contract, breach of express warranty, breach of implied maritime warranty, and negligence. The district court granted GE’s motion for summary judgment as to the negligence claim. Following Princess’s presentation of evidence at trial, GE made a motion for judgment as a matter of law, which the district court denied. At the conclusion of the defendant’s presentation of evidence, the district court denied GE’s second motion for judgment as a matter of law. In instructing the jury, the district court drew on principles set forth in U.C.C. §2-207 and allowed the jury to imply the following terms as part of the contract: (1) the warranty of merchantability; (2) the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose; (3) the warranty of workmanlike performance; (4) Princess’s right to recover damages for GE’s alleged breach of the contact; and (5) Princess’s right to recover incidental and consequential damages, as well as lost profits, proximately caused by GE’s alleged breach. On January 24, 1997, the jury returned a $4,577,743.00 verdict in favor of Princess. On February 3, 1997, GE renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law requesting that the court vacate the jury’s award of incidental and consequential damages. The district court heard oral argument on May 6, 1997. Following oral argument, the district court denied GE’s renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law and issued an opinion clarifying its ruling.</p>

<p id="032bcdea-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although GE contended that the district court was required to determine whether goods or services predominated before applying U.C.C. principles to the GE-Princess contract, the district court found it “unnecessary for the Court to determine whether the contract is primarily one for goods or services. In either case, the UCC is regarded as a source of admiralty law.” J.A. at 2024. We respectfully disagree.</p>
<p id="032bcdeb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of the primary concerns of admiralty law is uniformity and predictability. See American Dredging Co. v. Miller, 510 U.S. 443, 450-51 (1994) . . . . To avoid the creation of multiple and conflicting rules of decision in admiralty, the Fourth Circuit has stated that, “Absent reason to do otherwise, we prefer to adopt rules in admiralty that accord with, rather than diverge from, standard commercial <span title="168" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-168">p. 168</span>practice.” Finora Co. v. Amitie Shipping, Ltd., 54 F.3d 209, 213-14 (4th Cir. 1995). As discussed in more detail below, standard commercial practice requires that a transaction be predominantly for the sale of goods before the U.C.C. applies. See Coakley &amp; Williams, Inc. v. Shatterproof Glass Corp., 706 F.2d 456, 460 (4th Cir. 1983); Bonebrake v. Cox, 499 F.2d 951, 960 (8th Cir. 1974).</p>
<p id="032bcdec-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In its May 13, 1997 opinion, the district court correctly noted that U.C.C. principles inform admiralty law. See Southworth Mach. Co. v. F/V Corey Pride, 994 F.2d 37, 40 n.3 (1st Cir. 1993); Clem Perrin Marine Towing, Inc. v. Panama Canal Co., 730 F.2d 186, 189 (5th Cir. 1984). However, we are unpersuaded by cases cited to support the district court’s legal determination that U.C.C. §2-207 applies to maritime transactions regardless of the nature of the transaction . . . .</p>
<p id="032bcded-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given admiralty law’s goals of uniformity and predictability, we find that mixed maritime contracts for goods and services are subject to the same inquiry as land-based mixed contracts. Therefore, a court must first determine whether the predominant purpose of the transaction is the sale of goods. Once this initial analysis has been performed, the court then may properly decide whether the common law, the U.C.C., or other statutory law governs the transaction. Cf. Little Beaver Enters. v. Humphreys Rys., 719 F.2d 75, 79 n.7 (4th Cir. 1983) (noting that maritime contract for services was not covered by U.C.C.); In re American Export Lines, Inc., 620 F. Supp. 490, 515 (S.D.N.Y. 1985). This method accords with standard commercial practice and lends predictability to maritime contracts.</p>

<p id="032bcdef-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In its order denying GE’s renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law, the district court addressed GE’s contention that the district court erroneously included U.C.C. principles in its jury instructions. J.A. at 2021. Both by motion and at trial, GE argued that the district court was required to find that the sale of goods predominated in the GE-Princess contract before employing U.C.C. principles in its instructions.</p>
<p id="032bcdf0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the U.C.C. governs the sale of goods, the U.C.C. also applies to certain mixed contracts for goods and services. Whether a particular transaction is governed by the U.C.C., rather than the common law or other statutory law, hinges on the predominant purpose of the transaction, that is, whether the contract primarily concerns the furnishing of goods or the rendering of services. See Coakley &amp; Williams, 706 F.2d at 458 (“Whether the U.C.C. applies turns on a question as to whether the contract  . . . involved principally a sale of goods, on the one hand, or a provision of services, on the other.”) . . . . Thus, before applying the U.C.C., courts generally examine the transaction to determine whether the sale of goods predominates. See Coakley &amp; Williams, 706 F.2d at 458. Because the facts in this case are sufficiently developed and undisputed, it is proper for the Court to determine on appeal whether the GE-Princess transaction was a contract for the sale of goods within the scope of the U.C.C. Cf. Cambridge Plating Co. v. Napco, Inc., 991 F.2d 21, 24 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>

Cox, 499 F.2d 951 (8th Cir. 1974). In holding the U.C.C. applicable, the <i>Bonebrake</i> court stated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="032bcdf2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The test for inclusion or exclusion is not whether they are mixed but, granting that they are mixed, whether their predominant factor, their thrust, their purpose, reasonably stated, is the rendition of service, with goods incidentally involved (e.g., contract with artist for painting) or is a transaction of sale, with labor incidentally involved (e.g., installation of a water heater in a bathroom).</p>
</div>
<p id="032bcdf3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Bonebrake,</i> 499 F.2d at 960. The Fourth Circuit has deemed the following factors significant in determining the nature of the contract: (1) the language of the contract, (2) the nature of the business of the supplier, and (3) the intrinsic worth of the materials. See Coakley &amp; Williams, 706 F.2d at 460 (applying Maryland law).</p>
<p id="032bcdf4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is plain that the GE-Princess transaction principally concerned the rendering of services, specifically, the routine inspection and repair of the SS <i>Sky Princess,</i> with incidental — albeit expensive — parts supplied by GE. Although Princess’s standard fine-print terms and conditions mention the sale of goods, J.A. at 76, Princess’s actual purchase description requests a GE “service engineer” to perform service functions: the opening of valves for survey and the inspection of the ship’s port main turbine. J.A. at 75. GE’s Final Price Quotation also contemplates service functions, stating in large print on every page that it is a “Quotation for Services.” J.A. at 107-09. The Final Price Quotation’s first page notes that GE is offering a quotation for “engineering services.” J.A. at 106. GE’s Quotation further specifies that the particular type of service offered is “Installation/Repair/Maintenance.” J.A. at 107. The Final Price Quotation then lists the scope of the contemplated work — opening, checking, cleaning, inspecting, disassembling — in short, service functions. J.A. at 110; see also J.A. at 1862-68 (listing service tasks actually performed by GE). Although GE’s materials list shows that GE planned to manufacture a small number of parts for Princess, Princess appeared to have had most of the needed materials onboard. J.A. at 111. Thus, the language of both the Purchase Order and the Final Price Quotation indicates that although GE planned to supply certain parts, the parts were incidental to the contract’s predominant purpose, which was inspection, repair, and maintenance services.</p>
<p id="032bcdf5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As to the second <i>Coakley</i> factor — the nature of the business of the supplier — although GE is known to manufacture goods, GE’s correspondence and Quotations came from GE’s Installation and Service Engineering Department. J.A. at 97, 106, 115. Evidence at trial showed that GE’s Installation and Service Engineering division is comprised of twenty-seven field engineers who perform service functions, such as overhauls and repairs. J.A. at 1076. Finally, the last <i>Coakley</i> factor — the intrinsic worth of the materials supplied — cannot be determined because neither Princess’s Purchase Order nor GE’s Final Price Quotation separately itemized the value of the materials. Instead, both the Purchase Order and the Final Price Quotation blend the cost of the materials into the final price of a services contract, thereby confirming that services rather than materials <span title="170" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-170">p. 170</span>predominated in the transaction. Although not a <i>Coakley</i> factor, it is also telling that, during oral argument, Princess’s counsel admitted that the gravamen of Princess’s complaint did not arise out of GE’s furnishing of deficient parts, but rather out of GE’s deficient services. See J.A. at 23-27 (Princess’s Complaint stating that Princess’s damages arose out of “GE’s inspection, supervision  . . . recommendation  . . . reinstallation and realignment of the turbine unit.”) . . . . Accordingly, we find as a matter of law that services rather than goods predominated in the GE-Princess contract.</p>
<p id="032bcdf6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>V. <span class="epub-small-caps">Under Common Law, GE’S Final Price Quotation Was a Counteroffer Accepted by Princess</span></b></p>
<p id="032bf507-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The parties do not dispute that a contract was formed by their exchange of documents. J.A. at 2020. And there is no dispute that the GE-Princess contract for ship inspection and repair is maritime in nature and governed by the substantive law of admiralty . . . . However, the issue here — whether courts should draw on U.C.C. principles or on common-law doctrines when assessing the formation of a maritime services contract — is undecided. When no federal statute or well-established rule of admiralty exists, admiralty law may look to the common law or to state law, either statutory or decisional, to supply the rule of decision. Byrd v. Byrd, 657 F.2d 615, 617 (4th Cir. 1981) (admiralty may look to state law to supply rule of decision) . . . . Because the majority of states refer to common-law principles when assessing contracts predominantly for services, we choose to do the same.</p>
<p id="032bf508-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the common law, an acceptance that varies the terms of the offer is a counteroffer which rejects the original offer. RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS §59 (1981) (“A reply to an offer which purports to accept it but is conditional on the offeror’s assent to terms additional to or different from those offered is not an acceptance but is a counter-offer.”). Virginia follows the same rule. See Chang v. First Colonial Savs. Bank, 242 Va. 388, 410 S.E.2d 928, 931 (1991). Here, GE’s Final Price Quotation materially altered the terms of Princess’s Purchase Order by offering a different price, limiting damages and liability, and excluding warranties. Thus, GE’s Final Price Quotation was a counteroffer rejecting Princess’s Purchase Order. Although Princess could have rejected GE’s counteroffer, Princess accepted the Final Price Quotation by giving GE permission to proceed with the repair and maintenance services, by not objecting to the confirmatory letter sent by GE, and by paying the amount set forth in GE’s Final Price Quotation, $231,925.00, rather than the $260,000.00 price term set forth in Princess’s Purchase Order. At common law, an offeror who proceeds under a contract after receiving the counteroffer can accept the terms of the counteroffer by performance. See Diamond Fruit Growers, Inc. v. Krack Corp., 794 F.2d 1440, 1443 (9th Cir. 1986) (citing C. Itoh &amp; Co. (America) v. Jordan Intl. Co., 552 F.2d 1228, 1236 (7th Cir. 1977)); Durham v. National Pool Equip. Co. of Va., 205 Va. 441, 138 S.E.2d 55, 58 (1964) (“Assent may be inferred from the acts and conduct of the parties.”) (citations omitted). Although GE and Princess never discussed the Purchase Order’s and the Final Price Quotation’s conflicting terms and conditions, both Princess’s actions and inaction gave <span title="171" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-171">p. 171</span>GE every reason to believe that Princess assented to the terms and conditions set forth in GE’s Final Price Quotation. See RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS §19(1) (1981) (“The manifestation of assent may be made wholly or partly by written or spoken words or by other acts or by failure to act.”); Wells v. Weston, 229 Va. 72, 326 S.E.2d 672, 676 (1985) (“The mental assent of [contracting] parties is not requisite for the formation of a contract . . . . In evaluating a party’s intent  . . . we must examine his outward expression rather than his secret, unexpressed intention.”) (citations omitted). Accordingly, we find that the terms and conditions of GE’s Final Price Quotation control liability and damages in the GE-Princess transaction.</p>
<p id="032bf509-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>VI. <span class="epub-small-caps">The Verdict Demonstrates That the Jury Impermissibly Relied on a Contract Other Than GE’s Final Price Quotation</span></b></p>
<p id="032bf50a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the reasons stated above, the jury could only have considered one contract in awarding damages: GE’s Final Price Quotation. The Quotation restricted damages to the contract price, $231,925.00, and eliminated liability for incidental or consequential damages and lost profits or revenue. Moreover, GE’s Final Price Quotation controlled the warranties available to its customers. Yet the jury awarded $4,577,743.00 in damages to Princess. This verdict demonstrates that the jury relied on Princess’s Purchase Order or some other contract when awarding damages. See J.A. at 2025 (district court opinion noting that “the jury either found that Princess’[s] Purchase Order governed or that neither parties’ document established the complete contract”). As a matter of law, the jury could only have awarded damages consistent with the terms and conditions of GE’s Final Price Quotation and could not have awarded incidental or consequential damages. By requesting that the Court award Princess the maximum amount available under the Final Price Quotation, see Appellant’s Brief at 39-40; Appellant’s Reply Brief at 20, GE concedes that it breached its contract with Princess and that damages consistent with its Final Price Quotation are appropriate. Accordingly, we find it unnecessary to remand for a new trial on this issue. We reverse the district court’s decision denying GE’s motion for judgment as a matter of law and remand for entry of judgment against GE in the amount of $231,925.00, interest to accumulate from the date of the original judgment.</p>

Nevertheless, the court still finds it appropriate to determine whether the dispute is of a type which would otherwise be governed by Article 2 of the UCC, or by the common law of contract. The question is similar to the one raised in the <i>Jannusch</i> case earlier in this chapter. The <i>Princess Cruises</i> court’s conclusion that the predominant thrust of the contract would be properly seen as “services” rather than a “sale of goods” seems in line with most of the case <span title="172" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-172">p. 172</span>law in this area.

<li class=""><p id="032bf50f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Application of common law — the “mirror-image” rule.</i> Having concluded that the common law of contract should apply, rather than the UCC (or, more precisely, that the admiralty law applicable to this case should be informed by common law rather than by UCC Article 2 principles), the court proceeds to apply what it views as the common law rules of offer and acceptance. Classical contract law employed the “mirror-image” rule and the “last shot” rule. The first of these gives a “varying” acceptance the effect of only a counter-offer, preventing the contract from being made on the terms of the original offer. In <i>Princess Cruises,</i> the court applies the classical mirror-image rule in a contemporary setting. In support, the court cites Restatement (Second) §59, which merely echoes the classical rule of the first Restatement §60. The court fails, however, to quote Comment <i>a</i> to Restatement (Second) §59, which provides as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="032bf510-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>a. Qualified acceptance.</i> A qualified or conditional acceptance proposes an exchange different from that proposed by the original offeror. Such a proposal is a counter-offer and ordinarily terminates the power of acceptance of the original offeree. See §39. The effect of the qualification or condition is to deprive the purported acceptance of effect. But a definite and seasonable expression of acceptance is operative despite the statement of additional or different terms if the acceptance is not made to depend on assent to the additional or different terms. See §61; UCC §2-207(1). The additional or different terms are then to be construed as proposals for modification of the contract. See UCC §2-207(2).

<li class=""><p id="032bf512-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Application of common law — the “last shot” rule.</i> Classical courts followed the last shot rule to determine when a counter-offer was accepted. Under that rule, a party impliedly assented to and thereby accepted a counter-offer by conduct indicating lack of objection to it. In addition to being based on a questionable notion of implied assent, the last shot rule tended in practice to favor sellers over buyers, because sellers normally “fire the last shot” — i.e., send the last form. Professor John Murray well described the working of the common law rule; as his analysis shows (and as <i>Princess Cruises</i> continues to demonstrate), the favored party was typically — though not always — the seller.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="032bf513-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A typical variation of the problem occurs in innumerable contracts between buyers and sellers of goods. The buyer sends its offer through its standardized purchase order form. The seller replies and purportedly accepts the offer through its standardized acknowledgment (acceptance) form. Usually, the only written or typewritten terms on either form set forth the description, <span title="173" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-173">p. 173</span>price and quantity of the goods. The buyer’s form which contains the offer may or may not indicate the quality of the goods ordered. If no quality term is contained in the form, the buyer is entitled to goods of fair average quality or merchantable goods. This is an implied warranty of merchantability which is set forth in the U.C.C. Often, the seller’s form will contain a disclaimer of that implied warranty of merchantability. The disclaimer will be contained in a printed provision among many others somewhere on the form. The forms are exchanged, the goods are shipped and, perhaps, even paid for by the purchaser. When the buyer attempts to use the goods, he finds them to be of inferior, nonmerchantable quality. The buyer brings an action for breach of contract, specifically, breach of the implied warranty of merchantability. The seller argues that since his acknowledgment form did not exactly match the terms of the buyer’s offer, the form was not an acceptance of the offer. Rather, it was a counter-offer which created a new power of acceptance in the original offeror. When the goods were accepted and received by the purchaser, the counter-offer was accepted. Therefore, the contract or deal was made on the terms set forth in the seller’s form. In effect, the seller had the “last shot” since his form created the last power of acceptance which the buyer exercised presumably by accepting and receiving the goods on the terms set forth in the seller’s form. Under the matching acceptance rule, this analysis was clearly correct. Yet, the buyer never read the seller’s form, the seller never read the buyer’s form and neither read their own forms. The printed forms were simply a convenient means of expressing assent to the “dickered” terms, i.e., the written or typewritten terms which described the goods, their quantity and their price. Quaere: did the parties intend to be bound by the terms on the forms and, even if they did, which terms did they intend as binding? The question scarcely survives its statement. In the typical exchange, the parties manifested no intention whatsoever as to the printed provisions of their forms. Yet, they did physically exchange them and the forms constituted the only written evidence of their deal. The traditional judicial reaction was that the forms could not be ignored and since the terms thereon did not match, the last form had to be a counter-offer permitting the seller to have his “last shot” and to prevail.</p>

<p id="032c1c25-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court in <i>Princess Cruises</i> applies the classical last shot rule. Having concluded that GE’s response should be viewed as a counter-offer under the mirror image rule, the court then goes on to hold that Princess Cruises accepted that counter-offer by conduct: by not objecting to its terms; by accepting the services performed by GE; and by paying the price stated in GE’s counter-offer. In support, the court cites Restatement (Second) of Contracts §19(1), along with case law to the same effect. See Sharp Electronics Corp. v. Deutsche Financial Services Corp., 216 F.3d 388 (4th Cir. 2000) (manufacturer effectively accepted financer’s revised version of financing arrangement for customer’s purchases of inventory by continuing to ship inventory to customer with knowledge of terms of financer’s counter-offer).</p></li>

UCC §2-207 <span title="174" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-174">p. 174</span>significantly modifies, though it does not reject entirely, the application of both the mirror image rule and the last shot doctrine. The following cases and problem explore the Code’s approach. Before you study the next case, read through §2-207 and its comments. (No, it’s not easy going; we are well aware of that. Many courts have found this provision difficult to understand and apply.) Note that in Comment 1 to §2-207, the drafters identify two different situations which (somewhat awkwardly) they have attempted to cover in this single section. The first one mentioned in that comment, the use of “written confirmations,” involves an oral agreement between the parties (by telephone, typically), followed by written confirmations sent by one or both of the parties. The second situation mentioned in Comment 1 is the “varying acceptance” case where the parties exchange standard forms that disagree in their content. (<i>Princess Cruises</i> would fall into this general category, although of course that contract was not regarded as being primarily one for the sale of goods.) The following cases well illustrate the UCC’s handling of the “varying acceptance” situation under §2-207.</p></li>

<p id="032c1c2e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In early 1976 Brown Machine had sold appellant Hercules a T-100 trim press. The trim press was a piece of equipment apparently used in manufacturing Cool Whip bowls. The initial sales negotiations between the two companies for the trim press began in October 1975. Bruce Boardman, an engineer at Hercules, asked Jim Ryan, Brown Machine’s district sales manager, to send Hercules a quote for a trim press. On November 7, 1975, Brown Machine submitted its original proposal No. 51054 for the model T-100 trim press to Hercules. The proposal set out sixteen numbered paragraphs describing the machine to be sold. Attached to the proposal was a printed form of fifteen paragraphs in boilerplate style captioned “TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE.” The eighth paragraph provided as follows:</p>

On January 7, 1976, he telephoned Jim Ryan at Brown Machine. Mr. Ryan’s call report reflected that Hercules had prepared its purchase order No. 03361 in response to Brown Machine’s proposal but that Hercules had objected to the payment term requiring a twenty percent deposit be paid with the order. After talking with Mr. Fassett, Brown Machine’s product manager, Mr. Ryan told Mr. Wilson that Brown Machine could not waive the deposit and that an invoice for payment would be forwarded to Hercules.</p>
<p id="032c1c31-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Fassett issued a work order that day giving the shop instructions concerning the trim press equipment, followed by a written order the next day. The written order noted that “customer gave verbal P.O. [purchase order] for this stock machine. Will issue revision when formal purchase order received.”</p>
<p id="032c4342-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On January 19, 1976, Brown Machine received Hercules’ written purchase order No. 03361 dated January 6, 1976. The order was for a “Brown T-100 Trimpress in accordance with Brown Machine quote # 51054. All specifications cited within quote except item # 6.1.1 which should read: ‘Reverse trim’ instead of ‘Standard regular forward trim.’ ” In a blue box on the bottom left of the purchase order form in bold print appeared “THIS ORDER EXPRESSLY LIMITS ACCEPTANCE TO THE TERMS STATED HEREIN INCLUDING THOSE PRINTED ON THE REVERSE SIDE. ANY ADDITIONAL OR DIFFERENT TERMS PROPOSED BY THE SELLER ARE REJECTED UNLESS EXPRESSLY AGREED TO IN WRITING.” The reverse side of Hercules’ purchase order, captioned “TERMS AND CONDITIONS” contained sixteen boilerplate paragraphs, the last of which provided:</p>

On January 21, 1976, Brown Machine sent Hercules an invoice requesting payment of $4,882.00, the twenty percent deposit for the trim press.</p>
<p id="032c4347-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rather than returning the acknowledgment of the purchase order prepared by Hercules, Mr. Fassett of Brown Machine sent Hercules an “ORDER ACKNOWLEDGEMENT” dated February 5, 1976. This letter stated as follows:</p>

Paragraph 6.1.1 of the specifications again provided for “Standard-regular forward trim.” Page four of the acknowledgment contained the same “TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE” which had accompanied Brown Machine’s earlier proposal of November 7, 1975, including paragraph eight on liability and indemnity. Only two minor changes had been penned in on page four, neither of which has any bearing on the issues presented for appeal.</p>
<p id="032c434b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hercules responded with a letter on February 9, 1976, to Mr. Fassett that “This is to advise you that Provision 6.1 of your order acknowledgment dated 2/5/76 should read ‘Reverse Trim’ instead of ‘Standard-regular forward trim.’ All other specifications are correct.” On February 16, 1976, Mr. Fassett confirmed the change in provision 6.1.1 and informed the shop that same day of the requested modification to be made.</p>
<p id="032c434c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hercules never paid the twenty percent deposit. Brown Machine sent Hercules an invoice dated April 14, 1976, requesting final payment of the total purchase price. Brown eventually shipped the trim press to Hercules and Hercules paid the agreed-upon purchase price.</p>
<p id="032c434d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sometime later, James Miller, an employee of Hercules, and his wife sued Brown Machine because of injuries he sustained while operating the trim press at Hercules’ plant in Union, Missouri. Brown Machine demanded that Hercules defend the Miller lawsuit, but Hercules refused. Brown Machine eventually settled the Millers’ lawsuit. Brown Machine later initiated this action against Hercules for indemnification of the settlement amount paid the Millers. Brown Machine claimed a condition of the original sales contract for the trim press required Hercules to indemnify Brown Machine for any claims arising from operation or misuse of the trim press.</p>
<p id="032c434e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hercules’ four points on appeal challenge the submissibility of Brown Machine’s case, the verdict director given by Brown Machine, admission of certain allegedly prejudicial testimony and, finally, an instructional error. The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the parties had agreed to an indemnification provision in their contract for the sale of the T-100 trim press.</p>
<p id="032c434f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hercules’ first point disputes Brown Machine’s contention that its initial proposal on November 7, 1975, constitutes the offer and that Hercules verbally accepted the offer by the telephone call on January 7, 1976, followed by its written purchase order dated January 6, 1976, which Brown Machine received January 19, 1976.</p>
<p id="032c6a60-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code governs transactions involving the sale of goods. UCC §2-102 (1977). Because the term “offer” is not defined <span title="177" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-177">p. 177</span>in the code, the common law definition remains relevant. UCC §1-103. An offer is made when the offer leads the offeree to reasonably believe that an offer has been made. Gilbert &amp; Bennett Manufacturing Co. v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 445 F. Supp. 537, 545[3] (D. Mass. 1977). Restatement (Second) of Contracts §24 (1981) defines “offer” as “the manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain, so made as to justify another person in understanding that his assent to that bargain is invited and will conclude it.”</p>
<p id="032c6a61-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The general rule is that a price quotation is not an offer, but rather is an invitation to enter into negotiations or a mere suggestion to induce offers by others. Maurice Electrical Supply Co. v. Anderson Safeway Guard Rail Corp., 632 F. Supp. 1082, 1087[3] (D.D.C. 1986); USEMCO, Inc. v. Marbro Co., 60 Md. App. 351, 483 A.2d 88, 93[1] (1984). However, price quotes, if detailed enough, can amount to an offer creating the power of acceptance; to do so, it must reasonably appear from the price quote that assent to the quote is all that is needed to ripen the offer into a contract. Quaker State Mushroom Co. v. Dominick’s Finer Foods, Inc., 635 F. Supp. 1281, 1284[3] (N.D. Ill. 1986); see Boese-Hilburn Co. v. Dean Machinery Co., 616 S.W.2d 520, 524-25 (Mo. App. 1981).</p>
<p id="032c6a62-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case Hercules could not have reasonably believed that Brown Machine’s quotation was intended to be an offer, but rather an offer to enter into negotiations for the trim press. The cover letter accompanying the proposal mentioned that Brown Machine’s sales representative would contact Hercules “to discuss this quote” and that the quotation was submitted for Hercules [sic] “approval.” The sale price as quoted also included the notation “We have included a mechanical ejector (item 9.1.2) because we understand this unit may be used for development of many items that would require this option. However, if you decide this is not necessary $2,575.00 could be deducted from the above price for a total of $21,835.00.” Most importantly, paragraph three of the terms and conditions of sale attached to the proposal expressly provided: “No order, sale, agreement for sale, accepted proposal, offer to sell and/or contract of sale shall be binding upon BROWN unless accepted by BROWN  . . . on BROWN standard ‘Order Acknowlegment’[sic] form.” Thus, because the quotation reasonably appeared to be an offer to enter into negotiations for the sale of a trim press with a mechanical ejector for $24,410.00 with acceptance conditioned upon Brown’s order acknowledgment form, no firm offer existed. Accord, Quaker State Mushroom, Inc., 635 F. Supp. at 1285. Brown’s price quote was merely a proposal, not an offer, because of its provision that Hercules’ acceptance was not binding upon Brown until Brown acknowledged the acceptance.</p>
<p id="032c6a63-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if we were to accept Brown Machine’s characterization of its proposal as an offer, the quotation by its own terms and conditions expired thirty days after its issuance (“All quoted prices are subject to change without notice except those written proposals which shall expire without notice  . . . thirty (30) calendar days from date issued . . .”). Hercules’ written purchase order was dated January 6, 1976, and their telephone conversation of January 7, 1976, were both well beyond the expiration of the quote. Thus, even if the quotation were <span title="178" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-178">p. 178</span>construed as an offer, there was no timely acceptance. See Gilbert &amp; Bennett, 445 F. Supp. at 545[4].</p>
<p id="032c6a64-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the acceptance of a price quotation, sufficiently detailed to constitute an offer, is not binding on the seller because the time within which it could have been accepted has lapsed, the purchase order, not the price quotation, is treated as the offer since the purchase order did not create an enforceable contract. McCarty v. Verson Allsteel Press Co., 89 Ill. App. 3d 498, 44 Ill. Dec. 570, 411 N.E.2d at 936, 943[5] (1980). Thus, we believe Hercules’ purchase order constitutes the offer. As a general rule, orders are considered as offers to purchase. Aaron E. Levine &amp; Co. v. Calkraft Paper Co., 429 F. Supp. 1039, 1048[15] (E.D. Mich. 1976).</p>
<p id="032c6a65-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question then arises whether Brown Machine’s acknowledgment containing the indemnity provision constitutes a counter offer or an acceptance of Hercules’ offer with additional or different terms. Section 400.2-207, RSMo 1986, which mirrors §2-207 of the Uniform Commercial Code provides the workable rule of law addressing the problem of the discrepancies in the independently drafted documents exchanged between the two parties . . . .</p>
<p id="032c6a66-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under subsection (1) an offeree’s response to an offer operates as a valid acceptance of the offer even though it contains terms additional to, or different from, the terms of the offer unless the “acceptance is expressly made conditional” on the offeror’s assent to the additional or different terms. Where the offeree’s acceptance is made “expressly conditional” on the offeror’s assent, the response operates not as an acceptance but as a counter offer which must be accepted by the original offeror. Falcon Tankers, Inc. v. Litton Systems, Inc., 355 A.2d 898, 906[7] (Del. Super. 1976). Restatement (Second) of Contracts §59 (1981) expresses it succinctly: “[A]n offeree’s reply which purports to accept an offer but makes acceptance conditional on the offeror’s assent to terms not contained in the original offer is effective as a counteroffer rather than acceptance.”</p>
<p id="032c6a67-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The general view held by the majority of states is that, to convert an acceptance to a counter offer under UCC §2-207(1), the conditional nature of the acceptance must be clearly expressed in a manner sufficient to notify the offeror that the offeree is unwilling to proceed with the transaction unless the additional or different terms are included in the contract. See Annot., “What Constitutes Acceptance ‘Expressly Made Conditional’ Converting it to Rejection and Counteroffer under UCC §2-207(1),” 22 A.L.R. 4th 939, 948-49 (1983) and cases cited therein. The conditional assent provision has been construed narrowly to apply only to an acceptance which clearly shows that the offeree is unwilling to proceed absent assent to the additional or different terms. Id.; see Challenge Machinery Co. v. Mattison Machine Works, 138 Mich. App. 15, 359 N.W.2d 232, 235[3] (1984) citing Idaho Power Co. v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 596 F.2d 924 (9th Cir. 1979); Dorton v. Collins &amp; Aikman Corp., 453 F.2d 1161 (6th Cir. 1972).</p>
<p id="032c6a68-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We find nothing in Brown Machine’s acknowledgment of February 5, 1976, which reflects its unwillingness to proceed unless it obtained Hercules’ assent to the additional and different terms in Brown Machine’s acknowledgment, that <span title="179" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-179">p. 179</span>is, page four of the acknowledgment styled “TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE” which contained the indemnity provision. Brown Machine’s acknowledgment was not “expressly made conditional” on Hercules’ assent to the additional or different terms as provided for under §2-207(1). Acceptance will be considered a counteroffer only if the acceptance is expressly made conditional on assent to the additional terms. Clifford-Jacobs Forging Co. v. Capital Engineering &amp; Mfg. Co., 107 Ill. App. 3d 29, 62 Ill. Dec. 785, 787, 437 N.E.2d 22, 24 (1982). We conclude Brown Machine’s acknowledgment did not operate as a counter offer within the scope of §2-207(1).</p>
<p id="032c6a69-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having determined that Brown Machine’s order acknowledgment is not a counter offer, we believe that Brown Machine’s acknowledgment operates as acceptance with additional or different terms from the offer, since the purchase order contained no indemnity provision. Under §2-207(2), additional terms become a part of the contract between merchants unless (a) the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer; (b) they materially alter it; or (c) notification of objection to them has already been given or is given within a reasonable time after notice of them is given. Hercules’ purchase order here expressly limited acceptance to the terms of its offer. Given such an express limitation, the additional terms, including the indemnification provision, failed to become part of the contract between the parties.</p>
<p id="032c6a6a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We can conclude Hercules intended the indemnity provision to become a part of the parties’ contract only if Hercules, as offeror, expressly assented to the additional terms, and, thus, effectively waived its condition that acceptance be limited to the terms of its offer, the purchase order. While the text of §2-207 does not incorporate such a provision, Official Comment 3 to §2-207 states: “Whether or not additional or different terms will become part of the agreement depends upon the provisions of subsection (2). If they are such as materially to alter the original bargain, they will not be included unless expressly agreed to by the other party.” The indemnification provision was clearly a material alteration to the parties’ agreement.</p>
<p id="032c6a6b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The evidence does not establish that Hercules expressly assented to the additional terms contained in Brown Machine’s order acknowledgment. Brown Machine’s order acknowledgment of February 5, 1976, indicated that “[i]f these specifications and terms and conditions of Sale are not in accordance with your understanding, please ADVISE US WITHIN SEVEN (7) DAYS OF RECEIPT OF THIS ACKNOWLEDGMENT.” Hercules replied by letter four days later advising Brown Machine that provision 6.1.1 should provide for reverse trim instead of standard regular forward trim, followed by “all other specifications are correct.” Hercules’ use of the term “specifications” is unambiguous and clearly refers only to the protocol for the machine’s manufacture. Nothing in its response can be construed as express assent to Brown Machine’s additional “terms and conditions of sale.” Express assent under §2-207(2) cannot be presumed by silence or mere failure to object. N &amp; D Fashions, Inc. v. DHJ Industries, Inc., 548 F.2d 722, 726-27[5] (8th Cir. 1977).</p>

<li class=""><p id="032c9181-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The UCC’s treatment of the “varying acceptance.”</i> Courts and commentators frequently begin discussion of UCC §2-207 by noting that it appears to have as one of its principal purposes the amelioration of a strict “mirror image” approach to contract formation, by permitting non-matching communications to form a contract if the parties apparently intended that they should. E.g., Stelluti Kerr, L.L.C. v. Mapei Corp., 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 11804 (5th Cir.); ConocoPhillips Alaska, Inc. v. Williams Alaska Petro., Inc., 322 P.3d 114 (Alaska 2014) (§2-207 abrogates mirror image rule). The UCC’s modification of the mirror-image rule is stated in §2-207(1): “A definite and seasonable expression of acceptance  . . . operates as an acceptance even though it states terms additional to or different from those offered . . . . ” (If this seems to be merely a tautology, it may help to read the first use of the term <i>acceptance</i> as meaning, essentially, <i>assent,</i> and the second as meaning <i>legal acceptance.</i>)</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="032c9182-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Finding the first offer.</i> Under UCC §2-207, as in the classical approach to agreement-formation, the first step is to ascertain at what point an “offer” was first made by one party to the other. The court in <i>Brown Machine</i> thus begins by examining the communications between the parties and concludes that the first offer was the buyer’s purchase order of January 6; the seller’s “proposal” (or “quote”) of November 7 was not an offer, the court states, but merely an invitation to the buyer to submit an offer. Although a price quotation is often held to be only a preliminary negotiation, it may in some cases amount to an offer. The <i>Brown Machine</i> court recognizes this possibility but concludes that in this case the buyer could not have reasonably understood that the seller was making an offer. In reaching that conclusion, however, the court relies in part on the language of the seller’s form regarding the need for further acceptance by the seller. This is of course “boilerplate,” about which §2-207 might suggest we should be somewhat skeptical. (Do you think the buyer read that language?) If the seller’s initial proposal had not contained that provision, would the court’s characterization of it as a mere invitation for an offer still be persuasive?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="032c9183-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Testing the response.</i> Having established that the buyer’s purchase order was the first operative offer, the court then proceeds to apply the test of UCC §2-207(1) to the seller’s reply. If the seller had (as requested) merely signed and returned the buyer’s form, then the “battle of forms” would have been over at this point, and the buyer would have won — the terms of its purchase order would constitute the contract. See Michels Corp. v. Resitech Indus., LLC, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18466 (E.D. Wis.) (seller’s “sales order” in response to buyer’s purchase order was a pure acceptance that did not precipitate a battle of the forms because it listed terms in purchase order and did not contain any fine <span title="181" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-181">p. 181</span>print terms and conditions). But — as in <i>Princess Cruises</i> — each party preferred to use its own forms, so the seller instead responded with a form of its own, an “Order Acknowledgment.” Assuming that this form demonstrated sufficient general assent to the buyer’s order to be regarded as potentially an “acceptance,” the next issue under UCC §2-207(1) is whether the seller’s acceptance was “expressly conditional” (in which case, as the court declares, it functions not as an acceptance, but as a “counter-offer”).</p>
<p id="032c9184-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts have differed on when an acceptance should be treated as “expressly conditional” and therefore function as a counter-offer. An early case, Roto-Lith, Ltd. v. F.P. Bartlett &amp; Co., 297 F.2d 497 (1st Cir. 1962), held that an acceptance with terms that were materially different from the offer amounted to an expressly conditional acceptance. Courts and commentators criticized this view because it effectively reestablished the common law mirror image rule, contrary to the intentions of the drafters of UCC §2-207. E.g., White &amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code §2-3, at 40 (6th ed. 2010). In Ionics, Inc. v. Elmwood Sensors, Inc., 110 F.3d 184 (1st Cir. 1997), the First Circuit recognized its error in <i>Roto-Lith</i> and overruled the decision.</p>
<p id="032c9185-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since <i>Roto-Lith</i> has been overruled, it now seems well established that an acceptance does not amount to an expressly conditional acceptance simply because it contains terms that materially differ from the terms of the offer. But when is an acceptance expressly conditional? Most courts focus on the language of the acceptance. If the acceptance uses very clear language indicating that the offeree’s assent is expressly conditional on the offeror’s agreement to the terms of the offeree’s document, then the acceptance will be treated as expressly conditional, even if the language is essentially boilerplate. E.g., Diamond Fruit Growers, Inc. v. Krack Corp., 794 F.2d 1440, 1444 (9th Cir. 1986) (seller’s response expressly conditional; its “form tracks the language of the section”). The language, however, must be very clear. If the offeree simply states that its acceptance is “subject to the following terms and conditions” or equivalent conditional language, that is generally held not to be sufficient to treat the acceptance as expressly conditional. See Dorton v. Collins &amp; Aikman Corp., 453 F.2d 1161, 1167 (6th Cir. 1972) (“subject to all of the terms and conditions on the face and reverse side hereof, including arbitration, all of which are accepted by buyer” held not to be an expressly conditional acceptance); Option Wireless, Ltd. v. Openpeak, Inc., 2012 WL 6045936 (S.D. Fla.) (court should interpret “expressly made conditional” language narrowly; provision must either track the language of the statute or express intent to condition acceptance in no uncertain terms). Under this test Brown’s order acknowledgment was not an expressly conditional acceptance. How could you redraft Brown’s form to turn it into an expressly conditional acceptance?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="032c9186-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Have the additional terms been expressly assented to?</i> If the court concludes that the offeree’s response did amount to an “acceptance” but not a “conditional” one, it must in most cases go on to determine whether the additional terms in that acceptance have become part of the parties’ agreement under UCC §2-207. At this point, the §2-207 analysis proceeds to §2-207(2), which <span title="182" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-182">p. 182</span>declares that the additional terms are to be viewed as “proposals for addition to the contract.” The logical first question under UCC §2-207(2) would be, therefore: Has the offeror assented to the offeree’s proposed additional terms? In <i>Brown Machine,</i> the seller argued that the buyer had in effect accepted the seller’s terms by indicating (in writing) that, with one exception, “all other specifications are correct.” Was the court right to reject that argument? In another case involving a similar seller-indemnification clause, the seller contended that a “course of dealing” between the parties established that the clause had indeed been assented to by the buyer, the parties having “exchanged the same forms on prior occasions.” The court rejected that argument because there was no showing that any employee of the buyer had ever read such a form, or that a previous dispute had called the clause at issue to the buyer’s attention. The mere use or even repeated use of forms implies nothing about the parties’ awareness of their contents, the court asserted, because such forms are never read. Maxon Corp. v. Tyler Pipe Industries, Inc., 497 N.E.2d 570, 575-576 (Ind. Ct. App. 1986). As the <i>Brown Machine</i> opinion puts it, “<i>express</i> assent under §2-207(2) cannot be presumed by silence or mere failure to object” (emphasis supplied).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="032cb897-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Do the additional terms become part of the contract anyway?</i> If the additional terms have not been expressly assented to, might they nevertheless in some cases become part of the contract? UCC §2-207(2) provides for this possibility, in a case where the parties are both merchants. This will happen, however, only if the terms in question have not been objected to (either in advance — through language in the offer or otherwise — or thereafter) <i>and</i> if the terms in question are not “material.” The <i>Paul Gottlieb</i> case below and the Notes that follow it address the “material” alteration question.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="032cb898-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Has a counter-offer (conditional acceptance) been accepted?</i> Because it finds the seller’s response not to be a conditional acceptance, the court in <i>Brown Machine</i> does not have to face the other tough issue frequently raised in §2-207 cases: What constitutes effective assent to a counter-offer expressed in the form of a “conditional acceptance?” When will the additional terms it contains be binding on the other party? It is possible, of course, that the offeror could expressly agree to the terms of the offeree’s counter-offer. E.g., In re Mostek Corp., 502 N.Y.S.2d 181 (App. Div. 1986) (seller had signed buyer’s purchase order form with arbitration clause). In the absence of such express assent, can agreement be found in the offeror’s subsequent conduct? UCC §2-207 itself gives no clear answer to that question. The clear consensus of courts and commentators, however, is that conduct alone should not be sufficient to amount to assent to an expressly conditional acceptance. To find that mere performance equals assent to all the terms of a counter-offer would be to continue in effect the common law’s “last shot” approach, which the drafters of UCC §2-207 clearly were attempting to abrogate. See, e.g., Diamond Fruit Growers, Inc. v. Krack Corp., 794 F.2d 1440, 1445 (9th Cir. 1986) (buyer did not agree to terms of conditional acceptance containing disclaimer of warranties and limitation of consequential damages by continuing to receive and pay for goods; policy of Code requires “specific and unequivocal expression of assent”); White <span title="183" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-183">p. 183</span>&amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code §2-3, at 45-46 (6th ed. 2010). In the absence of real assent to the proposed additional terms, what then? In that case, even if the documents of the parties have not formed a contract, their actions (shipment and receipt of the goods) may at least establish a contractual relationship under UCC §2-207(3), and Comment 7 to §2-207. If the seller in <i>Brown Machine</i> had by tracking the statutory language succeeded in making its “acceptance” only a “conditional” one (and thus in effect a counter-offer), would its proposed indemnification clause have become part of the contract under UCC §2-207(3)?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="032cb899-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>What are “supplementary terms” under UCC §2-207(3)?</i> If an offeree’s response is deemed to be at most an “expressly conditional” acceptance, and thus in effect a counter-offer, but the parties nevertheless did proceed to performance without an express acceptance of the counter-offer’s terms, what then? Under UCC §2-207(3), the contract will consist of those terms on which the writings of the parties agree, “together with any supplementary terms incorporated under any other provisions of this act [i.e., the UCC].” Clearly those “supplementary terms” would include such implied terms under Article 2 as the implied warranties of merchantibility and fitness (UCC §§2-314 and 2-315) and the damages provisions, including seller liability for consequential damages (UCC §2-715), along with more innocuous “gap-filler” provisions of Article 2 (UCC §§2-307, 2-308, etc.). They also may include terms that are deemed part of the parties’ agreement by virtue of the Code’s provisions regarding “course of performance,” “course of dealing,” and “usage of trade” (UCC §1-303). See SFEG Corp. v. Blendtec, Inc., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12413 (M.D. Tenn.). But mere receipt of forms without objection may not be held to constitute a course of dealing or course of performance sufficient to establish assent to the terms of those forms, under UCC §2-207, even where forms are repeatedly sent over time:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="032cb89a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . [A] course of dealing may become part of an agreement, via a type of estoppel, when one party fails to object to the manner in which the other party performs under the agreement. Terms and conditions contained in a form continually sent by one party do not constitute performance and cannot become binding as a course of dealing . . . . The reason for this distinction between (a) a repeated manner of performance and (b) the repeated sending of forms is pragmatic. A party will certainly be cognizant of the manner in which the other side continually performs under the agreement, and if there is no objection to that performance by the first party, over a sufficient period of time, the first party is assumed to have acquiesced to the second party’s manner of performance. The same cannot be said of forms continually sent by one party to the other, which are often not read until a dispute arises.</p>

<p id="032cdfb2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Paul Gottlieb &amp; Co., Inc. (Gottlieb) appeals a final judgment awarding damages to Alps South Corp. (Alps) on its claim for breach of warranty. Gottlieb contends that the trial court erred by awarding consequential damages because the contract between the parties included a limitation of liability clause or, alternatively, because consequential damages were inappropriate in this case and were not sufficiently established by competent proof. We agree with Gottlieb in part and therefore reverse and remand with directions to the trial court. We conclude that the trial court erred in its analysis that the limitation of liability clause materially altered the contract. However, we also conclude Gottlieb’s undisputed breach of contract entitles Alps to seek certain benefit-of-the-bargain damages that flow directly and incidentally from Gottlieb’s breach under provisions of the Florida Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.). Accordingly, we remand the case to the circuit court to hold a new hearing on the limited question of the amount of damages only.</p>
<p id="032cdfb3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</b></p>
<p id="032cdfb4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Gottlieb is a fabric converter based in New York City. Gottlieb supplies its customers specialty knitted fabrics that are shipped directly from third-party knitting and finishing mills. Alps is a manufacturer of medical devices located in St. Petersburg, Florida. Alps produces various types of liners that amputees use to attach prosthetic devices. In January 2000, Alps used liners that consisted of a specially designed gel material covered in spandex fabric that stretched to allow the liner to be placed over the appendage and then compressed to provide stability.</p>
<p id="032cdfb5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alps began testing a number of new fabrics in February 2000 hoping to develop a new product possessed of enhanced durability and stability. Gottlieb was a source of the new fabrics. After some initial testing, Alps settled on a specialty fabric provided by Gottlieb identified as TL2646 Coolmax<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11BB9_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N11BB9_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">1</a></span> fabric which outperformed the other fabrics. Alps began incorporating the new fabric into its liners. Alps received positive feedback from its customers that the new liners had increased comfort. The commercial relationship between Alps and Gottlieb started out in a promising fashion.</p>
<p id="032cdfb7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unfortunately, six months later, in August 2000, the relationship began showing signs of a downturn. Alps rejected some fabric samples Gottlieb submitted because of unacceptable inconsistencies in both color and texture. On August 29, 2000, Alps sent a letter promptly notifying Gottlieb of the product deficiencies and stating that any future commercial relationship mandated that Gottlieb <span title="185" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-185">p. 185</span>provide a more consistent product. However, the letter did not inform Gottlieb of the possibility that Alps could incur substantial additional costs as a result of using a different fabric. Also Alps did not disclose the specialized use of the fabric to Gottlieb.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11BC5_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N11BC5_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">2</a></span> Gottlieb agreed to rework the fabric before delivering it to Alps.</p>
<p id="032cdfb9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Later events resulted in a worsening of the situation. Gottlieb exhausted its supply of the yarn used to produce the specialized high-tech fabric. It substituted a similar, but not identical, yarn without notifying Alps of the substitution. The trial court found this substitution caused a defect that was not easily discoverable by Alps. The new fabric did not stretch nearly as well as the original fabric that had been designated, tested, and approved by Alps. In early December of that same year, Alps began receiving complaints from customers that the fabric in the liners was less comfortable. The problems were so severe that Alps recalled the liners it had placed on the market and destroyed the devices in its inventory.</p>
<p id="032cdfba-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When Alps and Gottlieb discovered that the cause of the defective products was the undisclosed substitute yarn, the parties’ business relationship further deteriorated. The business relationship ended when Gottlieb failed to receive payment for a submitted bill. Gottlieb then brought an action to collect damages due to the nonpayment. In turn, Alps counterclaimed for damages it asserted were caused by Gottlieb’s breach of warranty. Of importance to the damage claim is the language set forth on the back of Gottlieb’s finished goods contract which purports to limit its liability. The trial court ultimately considered this language to be an affirmative defense to the counterclaim.</p>
<p id="032cdfbb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Following a nonjury trial, the trial court awarded damages to Gottlieb on its claim totaling $28,846.29; awarded damages to Alps on its counterclaim of $694,640.04; and determined that under Florida’s U.C.C. provisions, the limitation of liability clause was a material alteration of the parties’ contract. The trial court declined to enforce the provision concluding that by operation of law, it was not a part of the contract.</p>
<p id="032cdfbc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>II. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY CLAUSE</b></p>
<p id="032cdfbd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This dispute arises from the common, but risky, commercial practice where the seller and buyer negotiate a contract involving goods by exchanging each others’ standardized forms. The transactions of this type involved here are governed by section 2-207 of the U.C.C., codified in section 672.207, Florida Statutes (2000).</p>
<p id="032d06ce-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, Gottlieb first contends that the trial court erred by failing to enforce the limitation of liabilities clause found on the back of its finished goods contract. The clause in contention reads:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="032d06cf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">BUYER SHALL NOT IN ANY EVENT BE ENTITLED TO, AND SELLER SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY <span title="186" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-186">p. 186</span>NATURE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT BEING LIMITED TO, LOSS OF PROFIT, PROMOTIONAL OR MANUFACTURING EXPENSES, INJURY TO REPUTATION OR LOSS OF CUSTOMER.</p>
</div>
<p id="032d06d0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In its analysis, the trial court determined the clause constituted a material alteration under section 672.207(2) and as such it did not become part of the contract. In reaching this conclusion, the trial court determined that were it given effect, the limitation of liability “would allow Gottlieb to substitute a product without notice to Alps that would affect the final marketability of the final product.” We do not apply the same reasoning as the trial court. The fact that Gottlieb altered a yarn type that resulted in a breach of contract is separate and distinct from the legal analysis of how the language of the contract is construed. In other words, the cause of the breach, the substituted yarn, is a question of fact which the parties did not dispute. Therefore, the trial court only needed to determine whether the clause, as a matter of law, materially altered the contract. Since this is a pure question of law, we review the trial court’s conclusion de novo. Am. Strategic Ins. Co. v. Lucas-Soloman, 927 So. 2d 184 (Fla. 2d DCA 2006).</p>

<p id="032d2df0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having determined which party appropriately bears the burden of proof, we next address the nature of proof that a party must offer to meet its burden. Unfortunately, the law in this area is not yet clearly developed. For example, Official Comment 4 to U.C.C. §2-207 offers examples of “typical clauses which would normally ‘materially alter’ the contract” and that would “result in surprise or hardship if incorporated without express awareness by the other party.” For other examples, see Marvin Lumber &amp; Cedar Co. v. PPG Indus., Inc., 401 F.3d 901 (8th Cir. 2005);  . . . Dale R. Horning Co. v. Falconer Glass Indus., Inc., 730 F. Supp. 962 (S.D. Ind. 1990).</p>
<p id="032d2df1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In contrast, Official Comment 5 to U.C.C. §2-207 offers “[e]xamples of clauses which involve no element of <i>unreasonable surprise</i> and which therefore are to be incorporated in the contract unless notice of objection is seasonably given.” (Emphasis added.) Relying on this language and common law principles, some courts have removed hardship from the analysis and look solely for surprise. See Union Carbide Corp. v. Oscar Mayer Foods Corp., 947 F.2d 1333 (7th Cir. 1991); Suzy Phillips Originals, Inc. v. Coville, Inc., 939 F. Supp. 1012 (E.D.N.Y. 1996). Previously, this court considered whether a term was a material alteration under section 672.207 in Advanced Mobilehome Systems of Tampa, Inc. v. Alumax Fabricated Products, Inc., 666 So. 2d 166 (Fla. 2d DCA 1995), and approved of the rationale of <i>Union Carbide</i> to reach its decision (observing that a change is material if agreement to it cannot be presumed). There, Judge Posner explained:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="032d2df2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What is expectable, hence unsurprising, is okay; what is unexpected, hence surprising, is not. Not infrequently the test is said to be “surprise or hardship,” but this appears to be a misreading of Official Comment 4 to UCC §2-207. The comment offers examples of “typical clauses which would normally ‘materially alter’ the contract <i>and so result in surprise or hardship</i> if incorporated without express awareness by the other party” (emphasis added). Hardship is a consequence, <span title="188" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-188">p. 188</span>not a criterion. (Surprise can be either.) You cannot walk away from a contract that you can fairly be deemed to have agreed to, merely because performance turns out to be a hardship for you, unless you can squeeze yourself into the impossibility defense or some related doctrine of excuse.</p>
</div>
<p id="032d2df3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Union Carbide,</i> 947 F.2d at 1336 (citations omitted). Today, we continue to follow this rationale.</p>
<p id="032d2df4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Turning first to the surprise prong, Alps must prove “that, under the circumstances, it cannot be presumed that a reasonable merchant would have consented to the additional term.” See <i>Bayway Refining,</i> 215 F.3d at 224. The finished goods contract at issue was the sixth in a series between the two parties and each contract included the limitation of liability term. Each proposed contract contained the terms which were visible on its face. The sole evidence presented at trial to establish surprise was that Alps had not read the contract before the dispute arose. Florida law has never excused a party from a contract simply because it failed to read the contract terms. See Allied Van Lines, Inc. v. Bratton, 351 So. 2d 344 (Fla. 1977);  . . . . Additionally, Official Comment 5 to UCC §2-207 includes clauses which limit remedies in a reasonable manner among the examples of terms which do not involve unreasonable surprise. The record in this case does not allow a conclusion that Gottlieb’s limitation of liability clause was an unreasonable surprise to Alps.</p>
<p id="032d2df5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The record is similarly lacking with respect to hardship as a result of surprise. Courts that consider hardship look to whether the term would “impose substantial economic hardship on the non-assenting party.” <i>Horning,</i> 730 F. Supp. at 962  . . . . The <i>Horning</i> court reviewed a clause that provided “the buyer’s exclusive and sole remedy for defective goods shall be to secure replacement.” Id. at 963. In that case, the supplier was aware that the buyer could incur substantial liability if a breach occurred. Id. at 967. Further, the supplier’s actions, in offering to work with the buyer, caused the buyer to believe that its costs would be reimbursed because of the breach. Id. at 963-64. The <i>Horning</i> court concluded that “[i]n this situation, where [the supplier] knew or had reason to know that [the buyer] could incur substantial liability for delays in finishing its subcontract, there can be no doubt that a limitation of consequential damages would work a hardship on the buyer.” Id. at 963.</p>
<p id="032d2df6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, the facts do not permit a result identical to that of <i>Horning.</i> Gottlieb never represented that, in the event of a breach, it would reimburse Alps for any or all consequential damages it sustained resulting from the breach. Instead, the evidence showed that Alps previously had returned a sample of nonconforming fabric to Gottlieb with a letter insisting on conforming goods. This letter did not mention or make claim for additional costs or damages resulting from Gottlieb’s prior breach of performance. The evidence shows that Alps never informed Gottlieb of any consequences other than discontinuing their relationship. Alps did not inform Gottlieb of the specific manner in which the subject fabric would be used or what product would be crafted. Thus, Gottlieb could not foresee the <i>greater extent</i> of its potential liability, should a subsequent breach occur. Because Alps neglected to inform Gottlieb of the larger consequences of the breach, we conclude that Alps cannot maintain that incorporating the <span title="189" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-189">p. 189</span>limitation of liability clause would result in a severe economic hardship. Thus, Alps failed to carry the burden of proof on hardship.</p>
<p id="032d2df7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For these reasons, we conclude that the trial court erred by not enforcing the limitation of consequential damages clause. The award of consequential damages must be stricken.</p>
<p id="032d2df8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, we note that enforcing of the clause at issue only bars consequential damages. The limitation in this clause does not exclude other damages available under the law. See §672.719; Council Bros., Inc. v. Ray Burner Co., 473 F.2d 400 (5th Cir. 1973) (interpreting Florida law). We observe that section 671.106(1), Florida Statutes (2000), suggests that an injured party should not be worse off because the other party breached:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="032d2df9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The remedies provided by this code shall be liberally administered to the end that the aggrieved party may be put in as good as a position as if the other party had fully performed but neither consequential or special nor penal damages may be had except as specifically provided in this Act or by other rule of law.</p>
</div>
<p id="032d2dfa-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, Alps is still able to recover some of its direct and incidental damages, although it is precluded from receiving consequential damages. See §672.714-.715. Comment (a) of the Restatement of Contracts (Second) section 347 echoes this sentiment in that expectation damages are intended to give the injured party “the benefit of his bargain by putting him in as good as a position as he would have been had the contract been performed.” The code also provides for incidental damages arising from the breach. These “include expenses reasonably incurred in inspection, receipt, transportation and care and custody of goods rightfully rejected, any commercially reasonable charges, expenses or commissions in connection with effecting cover and any other reasonable expense incident to the delay or other breach.” §672.715(1). Therefore, the trial court may award Alps its direct and incidental damages. See Adam Metal Supply, Inc. v. Electrodex, Inc., 386 So. 2d 1316 (Fla. 2d DCA 1980) (holding a buyer’s expenses incurred before discovering a defect are recoverable as incidental damages).</p>
<p id="032d2dfb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>III. LOST PROFITS</b></p>
<p id="032d2dfc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although our holding enforces the limitation of liability clause which barred lost profits, we alternatively hold it was also error to award Alps damages for lost profits because Alps failed to prove them with reasonable certainty. Florida law allows for the award of consequential damages. See §§672.714-.715; Twyman v. Roell, 123 Fla. 2, 166 So. 215 (1936). However, lost profits “must be proven with a reasonable degree of certainty before [the loss] is recoverable.” Shadow Lakes, Inc. v. Cudlipp Constr. &amp; Dev. Co., 658 So. 2d 116, 117 (Fla. 2d DCA 1995) . . . .</p>
<p id="032d2dfd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>IV. INSTRUCTIONS ON REMAND</b></p>
<p id="032d2dfe-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although we find that Alps did not prove lost profits with reasonable certainty, we do recognize that Alps’ damages under the UCC came into existence at the moment Gottlieb delivered the fabric containing the unapproved <span title="190" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-190">p. 190</span>yarn. This deficiency was neither obvious nor discoverable until after Alps had incorporated the fabric into its product line investing time, labor, and materials in the finished products. As a merchant, Gottlieb is expected to know that direct and incidental damages could flow from a delivery of unapproved goods. Due to the limitation of liability clause, Gottlieb properly insulated itself from consequential damages, but it cannot shield itself from the direct and incidental damages naturally arising from the undisputed breach. We note again that the contract between the parties dealt only with supplying a specific and highly technical fabric made of a particular yarn combination. Gottlieb should have consulted with Alps prior to making a change in the yarn. However, Gottlieb did not notify Alps that it substituted an unapproved yarn for the earlier specified yarn. A clear nexus between the breach by Gottlieb and the injury to Alps exists. Accordingly, we leave open the possibility of more specific findings by the trial court as it revisits the issue of damages, including Gottlieb’s familiarity with Alps’ product requirements, the common trade practices and course of dealings in the fabric industry, the nature of Alps’ inventory and its cost to recover the defective items, and any other indicia of Alps’ loss or Alps’ ability to mitigate such loss that the trial court may find helpful . . . .</p>

<li class=""><p id="032d5513-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Does the additional term materially alter the contract?</i> Although the <i>Paul Gottlieb</i> opinion does not expressly address all of the steps, remember that the court necessarily had to resolve several other questions before getting to the issue of material alteration under UCC §2-207(2). First, the court had to find either that Alps made an offer that Paul Gottlieb accepted with a document that was “not expressly conditioned” on the buyer’s assent to the different or additional term, or that the parties had reached agreement and that Paul Gottlieb sent a written contract in confirmation. Either way, the exchange between the parties would have resulted in a contract, and the additional term excluding seller liability for consequential damages would have become a “proposal for addition.” Since both parties were merchants, the proposal to limit liability would become part of the contract unless excluded under UCC §2-207(2). There was no evidence that Alps objected in its offer to future changes, or that it objected after receiving the seller’s acceptance. Thus, Paul Gottlieb’s term would become part of the contract unless it would result in material alteration.</p>
<p id="032d5514-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As noted by the <i>Paul Gottlieb</i> court, the comments to UCC §2-207 provide examples of clauses that typically do or do not amount to a material alteration of the contract. Comment 5 offers examples of terms that would not materially alter, including one that limits remedies “in a reasonable manner.” In addition, <span title="191" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-191">p. 191</span>as the opinion indicates, many courts have used the test whether a term would result in “surprise or hardship” to determine material alternation. In concluding that the term excluding consequential damages would not result in material alteration, the <i>Paul Gottlieb</i> court notes that the parties had a series of contracts with the same limiting language and that there was not any evidence that the seller knew much about possible financial hardship to the buyer if the fabric was defective. Are you persuaded by the court’s reasoning on this issue? Recall that the authority cited in Note 4 after the <i>Brown Machine</i> case rejected the argument that repeated use of a standard document was evidence that anyone had ever read it. Courts differ widely in their approach to determining materiality under UCC §2-207(2). See, e.g., C.A.I., Inc. v. Vitex Packaging Group, Inc., 2015 WL 4396266 (D. Mass.) (provision limiting damages to cost of product and excluding consequential damages held to be not material, but provision excluding all express and implied warranties was material).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="032d5515-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Additional vs. different terms.</i> Note that UCC §2-207(1) mentions both “additional” and “different” terms, while UCC §2-207(2) addresses only “additional” terms as possibly becoming part of the contract. Many, if not most, courts have read the omission of “different” terms from UCC §2-207(2) to mean that “different” terms in the acceptance or confirmation drop out altogether and cannot become part of the contract. See John E. Murray, Jr., Murray on Contracts 185-186 (5th ed. 2011). On the other hand, Official Comment 3 begins by stating, “[w]hether or not additional or different terms will become part of the agreement depends upon the provisions of subsection (2).” That language supports the view that the omission of different terms from the text of UCC §2-207(2) was merely an oversight by the drafters. This latter construction is also supported by the difficulty of distinguishing whether a particular change in terms by the offeree is an “additional” or a “different” term. How would you classify the limitation on liability in <i>Paul Gottlieb</i> and <i>Princess Cruises</i> or the indemnification clause in <i>Brown Machine</i>? As an additional term? Or a different one?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="032d5516-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The “knockout” rule.</i> As the foregoing cases and notes demonstrate, UCC §2-207 is very complicated, and difficult to interpret and apply. Another problem with the section is that some courts have developed a “knockout approach” to deal with situations where the standard form offer has a term, such as a seller’s limitation of warranty protection to 90 days, and the standard form acceptance by the buyer provides for a warranty of unlimited duration. Under the “knockout” approach, both terms would drop out and the duration of the warranty would be determined by application of Article 2. The underlying rationale for the knockout rule is that it favors neither the offer nor the acceptance where the terms disagree. See Northrop Corp. v. Litronic Industries, 29 F.3d 1173 (7th Cir. 1994); Operating Tech. Elecs., Inc. v. Generac Power Sys., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 199100 (N.D. Tex.) (discussing and recognizing that the “knockout” rule is the majority view but predicting that the Texas Supreme Court would not follow that approach). Do you see anything in the section or comments that would support the knockout rule?</p>

Article 19 of the CISG starts by providing that an acceptance with changes is a “counter-offer,” but goes on to state that a reply with “additional or different terms” which do not materially alter the terms is still effective. Finally, Article 19 defines a “material” term as one affecting things such as price, payment, quality and quantity, place and time of delivery, party liability for breach, and the settlement of disputes. Professor Dodge’s assessment is that ultimately the CISG does not deviate much from the American common law:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="032d5518-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The CISG  . . . adopts what is essentially a mirror-image rule. Article 19(1) provides: “A reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but contains additions, limitations or other modifications is a rejection of the offer and constitutes a counter-offer.” Article 19(2) attempts to soften this rule a little by providing that if the additional or different terms are not material <i>and</i> the offeror does not object to them, then the purported acceptance is an acceptance and the additional or different terms become part of the contract. But Article 19(3) defines materiality so broadly that it is hard to imagine a change that the CISG would not consider material. This means that, in almost every case, an acceptance that varies the terms of the offer will be a counteroffer which will be accepted by the other party’s conduct.</p>

<p id="032d7c2f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mendoza Construction Company is a general contractor that handles major commercial construction projects. Mendoza is the general contractor for the construction of several buildings on the “campus” of Wintel, Inc., a major communications company that is consolidating its operations outside of Columbus. G&amp;P Industries is a supplier of various industrial products, including roofing materials and compounds.</p>
<p id="032d7c30-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On September 15, Margaret Novak, the Mendoza supervisor for the Wintel project, called Frank Park at G&amp;P to determine the price, availability, and delivery schedule for various roofing materials and compounds for the Wintel project. Park provided Novak with the information she requested and told her that if she wished to place an order she should do so as soon as possible because demand for the company’s products was very brisk. On the afternoon of October 1, Novak sent an email to Park. The email stated that Mendoza wished to place an order for various roofing products and compounds. The price and delivery schedule stated in Novak’s note were as quoted by Park in the conversation on September 15, which provided that delivery of all materials was to be made by November 15.</p>
<p id="032d7c31-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the morning of October 2, Park sent a fax back to Novak confirming receipt of Novak’s order. In addition to confirming the basic terms of Novak’s order, the fax also stated:</p>

Novak immediately called Park to complain about the delay, but Park informed her that there was simply nothing he could do. Novak told Park that the delay would subject Mendoza to damages to Wintel under a liquidated damages provision of the contract between Wintel and Mendoza, and that Mendoza would hold G&amp;P responsible for the damages. Park replied that G&amp;P was not responsible for any delays beyond its control. Park also said that if Mendoza refused to honor the contract, G&amp;P would retain the deposit and seek other damages. The telephone conversation ended without resolution of the issue.</p>
<p id="032da34b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Novak then contacted other suppliers of roofing materials and learned that another company could in fact supply Mendoza’s needs in a timely fashion.

Later in the course we will examine various legal doctrines, such as “impossibility” or “impracticability,” that might excuse a party such as G&amp;P from performance even in the absence of a contractual provision providing some form of excuse. It is likely, however, that none of these doctrines would apply to a situation like this one, and that the seller’s failure to make timely delivery would be a breach. It would also ordinarily be the case, under the general rules of Article 2, that a seller’s delay in delivery would entitle the buyer to cancel and potentially to seek damages for delay. Paragraph 6 of the seller’s Terms and Conditions appears intended to change the application of those “default” rules to this transaction. In light of all this, what advice would you give to Novak?</p>

<p id="032da353-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As we have seen, the classical model of contract formation was based on two major assumptions: The contracting parties had relatively equal bargaining power, and they actually engaged in the process of bargaining — perhaps by mail, but often in person. For more than a century the assumptions upon which the classical model were based have been breaking down. Although many significant commercial contracts still conform to the classical model, most modern contracts do not. The vast majority of present-day contracts involve parties with radically unequal bargaining power; their contracts consist of standard forms and involve little, if any, negotiation; and the contracts are often formed through electronic transactions rather than person-to-person communications.</p>
<p id="032da354-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As illustrated by the <i>Meyer</i> case in Chapter 1, courts are now confronting issues involving contracts made over the Internet or by other electronic means. Naturally and as a matter of necessity, courts have attempted to adapt existing legal sources to deal with these issues. At the same time, courts and commentators have developed a new terminology to describe the various transactions the courts are encountering. The case law and literature involving electronic contracts refer to various types of terms, including “shrinkwrap,” “clickwrap” or “clickthrough,” and “browsewrap.” (We have used the word “terms” here rather than “contracts” or “agreements” because the principal legal issue is whether these terms do in fact have contractual significance.)</p>
<p id="032da355-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a transaction involving s<i>hrinkwrap terms</i>, the purchaser orders a product (for example, a computer, a home appliance, or software). The order could be placed by telephone or over the Internet, or the product might be purchased at a “brick-and-mortar” store. When the purchaser receives physical possession of the product, it is boxed and wrapped in plastic. Often (but not always) a warning on the outside of the box informs the purchaser that the package contains the seller’s contract terms and that the purchaser’s use of the product will constitute agreement with those terms. After removing the wrapping, the purchaser has an opportunity to inspect the product and review the contract terms. These typically (but again, not in every situation) state that if the purchaser is dissatisfied with the product or with the contract terms, the purchaser may return the product to the seller within a certain number of days. The contract terms also state that if the purchaser does not return the product within that period of time, the purchaser agrees to the seller’s terms. These could involve both “substantive” terms (disclaimers of warranty, limitations on liability, exclusions of consequential damages, etc.) and “procedural” ones (choice of law or forum provisions, arbitration clauses, etc.). The seller may, but will not necessarily, agree to pay for the cost of shipment back to the seller if the product is returned by the buyer. Transactions involving shrinkwrap terms are sometimes referred to as “rolling contracts,” “layered contracts,” or “money now, terms later” contracts.</p>
<p id="032da356-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="196" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-196">p. 196</span>In the typical transaction involving <i>clickwrap terms</i>, before completing the purchase of the product, the purchaser must click a button labeled “I agree,” “submit,” or some equivalent phrase. Often the purchaser must scroll through the seller’s terms of sale before clicking the agreement button. In the typical transaction involving <i>clickwrap terms</i>, before completing the purchase of the product, the purchaser must scroll through the seller’s terms of sale and click a button labeled “I agree,” “submit,” or some equivalent phrase. Some sellers may go further and require the purchaser to put his or her initials in a box to signify agreement with the seller’s terms of sale. If the purchaser refuses to do so, the seller will not complete the sale. Clickwrap transactions over the Internet can involve software, services, or tangible products. If the purchaser buys software or a tangible product at a store in a box, the box will typically have a shrinkwrap contract, and any software will be subject also to a clickwrap contract to which the purchaser must agree before being able to use the software.</p>
<p id="032dca67-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, transactions with <i>browsewrap terms</i> typically involve information made available by Internet providers on their websites, often (but not necessarily) free of charge, and often (although again, not necessarily) involving information that the user accesses but does not always download. In the typical browsewrap transaction, the Internet provider has posted the terms of use on its website. The terms of use state that by using the site the user agrees to the provider’s terms of use. As noted in the <i>Meyer</i> case, the browsewrap and the clickwrap transactions have a fundamental difference. In the clickwrap transaction the terms are available for review, and the purchaser must click an agreement button in order to complete the transaction. In a browsewrap transaction the terms of use are normally accessible from the provider’s home page by clicking a button, but the user is not required (or even encouraged) to scroll through the terms of use, and is not required to click any agreement button. The user’s purported agreement to the provider’s terms of use comes simply from the user’s actions in browsing the site.

(Dell), Dell Catalog Sales LP (Dell Catalog), Dell Marketing LP (Dell Marketing), QualxServ, LLC (QualxServ), and BancTec, Inc. (BancTec), collectively (defendants), appeal from a Superior Court order denying their motion to stay proceedings and compel arbitration. This case is the first of two companion cases now before this Court. See Long v. Dell, Inc., No. 2007-346-M.P., 984 A.2d 1074, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 141 (R.I., filed Dec. 14, 2009). It arises out of a long-frustrated putative class-action suit brought against the defendants. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>
<p id="032dca72-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>I. <span class="epub-small-caps">Facts and Travel</span></b></p>
<p id="032df183-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This litigation began on May 16, 2003, when Mary E. DeFontes, individually and on behalf of a class of similarly situated persons, brought suit against Dell, alleging that its collection of taxes from them on the purchase of Dell optional service contracts violated the Deceptive Trade Practices Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 13.1 of title 6. Ms. DeFontes asserted that service contracts, such as the option service contract offered by Dell, were not taxable within the State of Rhode Island. Nicholas Long joined the suit as a plaintiff, and an amended complaint was filed on July 16, 2003, that also added Dell subsidiaries Dell Catalog and Dell Marketing, and two service providers, QualxServ and BancTec as defendants.</p>
<p id="032df184-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dell is an international computer hardware and software corporation. Within the Dell corporate umbrella, Dell Catalog and Dell Marketing primarily are responsible for selling computers via the internet, mail-order catalogs, and other means to individual and business consumers. Dell ships these orders throughout all fifty states from warehouses located in Texas and Tennessee. As part of these purchases, Dell offers consumers an optional service contract for on-site repair of its products, with Dell often acting as an agent for third-party service providers, including BancTec and QualxServ. Parties opting to purchase a service contract are charged a “tax,” which is either paid to the State of Rhode Island directly or collected by the third-party service provider and then remitted to the state.</p>
<p id="032df185-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The two initial plaintiffs, Ms. DeFontes and Mr. Long, engaged in slightly different transactions. Ms. DeFontes purchased her computer through Dell Catalog and selected a service contract with BancTec. She paid a total of $950.51, of which $13.51 was characterized as tax on the service contract. Mr. Long purchased his computer through Dell Marketing and opted for a service contract managed by Dell. In total, he paid $3,037.73, out of which $198.73 was designated as tax paid on the service contract. There is no allegation that Dell improperly retained any of the collected tax. Several months after plaintiffs filed their amended complaint, defendants filed a motion to stay proceedings <span title="198" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-198">p. 198</span>and compel arbitration, citing an arbitration provision within the parties’ purported agreements.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11E46_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N11E46_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">2</a></span> The defendants argued that the arbitration provision was part of a “Terms and Conditions Agreement,” which they contended plaintiffs had accepted by accepting delivery of the goods. Specifically, they averred that plaintiffs had three separate opportunities to review the terms and conditions agreement, to wit, by selecting a hyperlink on the Dell website, by reading the terms that were included in the acknowledgment/invoice that was sent to plaintiffs sometime after they placed their orders, or by reviewing the copy of the terms Dell included in the packaging of its computer products.</p>
<p id="032df188-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The hearing justice issued a written decision on January 29, 2004. He  . . . found that although plaintiffs had three opportunities to review the terms, none was sufficient to give rise to a contractual obligation. First, he noted that plaintiffs could have reviewed the terms and conditions agreement had they clicked a hyperlink that appeared on Dell’s website. The hearing justice found, however, that this link was “inconspicuously located at the bottom of the webpage” and insufficient to place customers on notice of the terms and conditions.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11E56_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N11E56_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">3</a></span> Nevertheless, the hearing justice noted that the terms and conditions agreement also appeared both in the acknowledgment that Dell sent to plaintiffs when they placed their orders and later within the packaging when the computers were delivered.</p>
<p id="032df18a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The hearing justice noted that “courts generally recognize that shrinkwrap agreements, paper agreements enclosed within the packaging of an item, are sufficient to put consumers on inquiry notice of the terms and conditions of a transaction.” He also observed, however, that shrinkwrap agreements generally contain an express disclaimer that explains to consumers that they can reject the proposed terms and conditions by returning the product. The crucial test, according to the hearing justice, was “whether a reasonable person would have known that return of the product would serve as rejection of those terms.” He looked to the introductory language of the terms and conditions agreement, which he quoted as follows,<span title="199" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-199">p. 199</span></p>

<p id="032e189d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The hearing justice found that this language was insufficient to give a reasonable consumer notice of the method of rejection. He found that defendants’ failure to include an express disclaimer meant that they could not prove that plaintiffs “knowingly consent[ed]” to the terms and conditions of the agreement. Accordingly, the hearing justice found that Plaintiffs could not be compelled to enter arbitration.</p>
<p id="032e189e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the hearing justice noted that it was unnecessary to address plaintiffs’ alternative arguments that the contract was both illusory and unconscionable, he discussed them in his decision “for the sake of completeness.” First, he rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the agreement was unconscionable because it prevented them from asserting rights as a class. He found that there was no right under Texas law to proceed as a class action litigant. See Autonation U.S.A. Corp. v. Leroy, 105 S.W.3d 190, 199-200 (Tex. App. 2003).</p>
<p id="032e189f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the hearing justice addressed whether the agreement was illusory. He found that the arbitration agreement was not illusory merely because it required plaintiffs to submit to arbitration while allowing defendants to litigate any of its claims in court. He noted the well-settled principle that “although mutuality of obligation is necessary to create a valid contract, ‘equivalency of obligation’ is not.” The hearing justice went on, however, to find that the terms and conditions agreement was illusory because it included the language “[t]hese terms and conditions are subject to change without prior written notice, at any time, in Dell’s sole discretion.” He rejected defendants’ contention that this language applied only to future transactions and found that it failed to bind defendants to the terms and conditions agreement.</p>

In ProCD, Inc. v. Zeidenberg, 86 F.3d 1447, 1452-53 (7th Cir. 1996), the court challenged the traditional understanding of offer and acceptance in consumer transactions by holding that a buyer of software was bound by an agreement that was included within the packaging and later appeared when the buyer first used the software.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11EBC_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N11EBC_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">11</a></span> Id. The court first held that U.C.C. §2-207 was inapplicable because in cases involving only one form, the “battle-of-the-forms” provision was irrelevant. <i>ProCD, Inc.,</i> 86 F.3d at 1452. It then proceeded to evaluate the agreement under U.C.C. §2-204 and reasoned that “[a] vendor, as master of the offer, may invite acceptance by conduct, and may propose limitations on the kind of conduct that constitutes acceptance. A buyer may accept by performing the acts the vendor proposes to treat as acceptance.” <i>ProCD, Inc.,</i> 86 F.3d at <span title="201" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-201">p. 201</span>1452. In Hill v. Gateway 2000, Inc., 105 F.3d 1147, 1148-49 (7th Cir. 1997), the court expanded its earlier holding in <i>ProCD</i> beyond transactions involving software where the consumer is prompted to accept or decline the terms when he first uses the program. It determined that when a merchant delivers a product that includes additional terms and conditions, but expressly provides the consumer the right to either accept those terms or return the product for a refund within a reasonable time, a consumer who retains the goods beyond that period may be bound by the contract. Id. Judge Easterbrook explained,</p>

Cashiers cannot be expected to read legal documents to customers before ringing up sales. If the staff at the other end of the phone for direct-sales operations such as Gateway’s had to read the four-page statement of terms before taking the buyer’s credit card number, the droning voice would anesthetize rather than enlighten many potential buyers. Others would hang up in a rage over the waste of their time. And oral recitation would not avoid customers’ assertions (whether true or feigned) that the clerk did not read term X to them, or that they did not remember or understand it.”</p>

See, e.g., O’Quin v. Verizon Wireless, 256 F. Supp. 2d 512, 515-16 (M.D. La. 2003) (“Terms and Conditions Pamphlet” binding where acceptance expressed by activation and use of wireless services as long as “opportunity to return”);  . . . Brower v.

Moreover, as plaintiffs’ counsel has initiated nationwide litigation, a number of sister jurisdictions have decided more or less the precise issue put before us in defendants’ favor. For instance, in Stenzel v. Dell, Inc., 2005 ME 37, 870 A.2d 133 (Me. 2005), the Maine Supreme Judicial Court reviewed a similar terms and conditions agreement sent to Dell customers that included the language,</p>

In Step-Saver Data Systems, Inc. v. Wyse Technology, 939 F.2d 91, 98 (3d Cir. 1991), the court determined that when parties exchange the shipment of goods for remuneration the existence of a contract is not in doubt; rather, any dispute relates solely to the nature of its terms. After deciding that U.C.C. §2-207 applies to situations in which a party sends a confirmatory document that claims to establish additional terms of the contract, the court held that U.C.C. §2-207 “establishes a legal rule that proceeding with a contract after receiving a writing that purports to define the terms of the parties’s contract is not sufficient to establish the party’s consent to the terms of the writing to the extent that the terms of the writing either add to, or differ from, the terms detailed in the parties’s earlier writings or discussions.” Id. at 99. The court therefore held that a licensing agreement affixed to the packaging constituted a proposal for additional terms that was not binding unless expressly agreed to by the purchaser. Id. at 100; see also <i>Klocek,</i> 104 F. Supp. 2d at 1339, 1341 (finding buyer’s “act of keeping the computer past five days was not sufficient to demonstrate that plaintiff expressly agreed to the Standard Terms” and criticizing the <i>Hill</i> court’s summary dismissal of U.C.C. §2-207 by stating “nothing in its language precludes application in a case which involves only one form”); Licitra v. Gateway, Inc., 189 Misc. 2d 721, 734 N.Y.S.2d 389, 396 (N.Y. Civ.

<p id="032e3fc4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="203" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-203">p. 203</span>After reviewing the case law pertaining to so-called “shrinkwrap” agreements, we are satisfied that the <i>ProCD</i> line of cases is better reasoned and more consistent with contemporary consumer transactions. It is simply unreasonable to expect a seller to apprise a consumer of every term and condition at the moment he or she makes a purchase. A modern consumer neither expects nor desires to wade through such minutia, particularly when making a purchase over the phone, where full disclosure of the terms would border on the sadistic. Nor do we believe that, after placing a telephone order for a computer, a reasonable consumer would believe that he or she has entered into a fully consummated agreement. See Axelson, Inc. v. McEvoy-Willis, a Division of Smith International (North Sea), Ltd., 7 F.3d 1230, 1232-33 (5th Cir. 1993) (“An offer is an act that leads the offeree reasonably to believe that assent (i.e., acceptance) will conclude the deal.”). Rather, he or she is aware that with delivery comes a multitude of standard terms attendant to nearly every consumer transaction.</p>
<p id="032e3fc5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We therefore decline to adopt the minority view, as urged by plaintiffs, that a contract is fully formed when a buyer orders a product and the seller accepts payment and either ships or promises to ship. Instead, formation occurs when the consumer accepts the full terms after receiving a reasonable opportunity to refuse them. Yet in adopting the so-called “layered contracting”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11F26_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N11F26_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">14</a></span> theory of formation, we reiterate that the burden falls squarely on the seller to show that the buyer has accepted the seller’s terms after delivery. Thus, the crucial question in this case is whether defendants reasonably invited acceptance by making clear in the terms and conditions agreement that (1) by accepting defendants’ product the consumer was accepting the terms and conditions contained within and (2) the consumer could reject the terms and conditions by returning the product.</p>
<p id="032e3fc7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the first question, defendants notified plaintiffs that “[b]y accepting delivery of the computer systems, related products, and/or services and support, and/or other products described on that invoice[,] You (‘Customer’) agrees to be bound by and accepts those terms and conditions.” This language certainly informed plaintiffs that defendants intended to bind them to heretofore undisclosed terms and conditions, but it did not advise them of the period beyond which they will have indicated their assent to those terms. The defendants argue that the meaning of the term “accepting delivery” is apparent to a reasonable consumer. We are not so sure . . . . “Acceptance of goods” has a technical <span title="204" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-204">p. 204</span>meaning not easily discernable to the average consumer. A consumer may believe that simply by opening the package he or she has agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions contained therein. Indeed, many of the courts that have enforced so-called “approve-or-return” agreements cite language informing the consumer of a specific period after which he or she will have accepted the terms. See, e.g., <i>Hill,</i> 105 F.3d at 1148 (terms govern if consumer retains beyond thirty days); <i>Brower,</i> 676 N.Y.S.2d at 570 (“By keeping your Gateway 2000 computer system beyond thirty (30) days after the date of delivery, you accept the Terms and Conditions.”). The more problematic issue, however, is whether plaintiffs were aware of their power to reject by returning the goods.</p>
<p id="032e3fc8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Significantly, the agreement sent to Ms. DeFontes, who is no longer a plaintiff in this case, contained additional language advising her of the method of rejection. The introductory provision of the terms and conditions agreement that defendants sent to her stated, “[i]f for any reason Customer is not satisfied with a Dell-branded hardware system, Customer may return the system under the terms and conditions of Dell’s Total Satisfaction Return Policy * * *.” In doing so, defendants explicitly contrasted acceptance of the terms with rejection of the goods, albeit while retaining some ambiguity whether rejection of defendants’ proposed terms could reasonably be construed as dissatisfaction with “Dell-branded hardware.” Many of the cases upholding shrinkwrap agreements cite explicit disclaimers advising consumers of their right to reject the terms. See, e.g., ProCD, Inc. v. Zeidenberg, 908 F. Supp. 640, 644 (W.D. Wis. 1996) (“If you do not agree to the terms of this License, promptly return all copies of the software, listings that may have been exported, the discs and the User Guide to the place where you obtained it.”);  . . . <i>M.A. Mortenson Co.,</i> 998 P.2d at 308 (“IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, PROMPTLY RETURN * * * TO THE PLACE OF PURCHASE AND YOUR PURCHASE PRICE WILL BE REFUNDED”) . . . . Although the above language is significantly clearer, the terms and conditions agreement sent to Ms. DeFontes nevertheless made the important connection between acceptance of the terms by accepting delivery and rejection by returning the goods.</p>
<p id="032e3fc9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That this language is absent in the documents sent to current plaintiffs Mr. Long and Ms. Ricci is troubling and raises the specter that they were unaware of both their power to reject and the method with which to do so. The introductory provision that purportedly bound plaintiffs does not mention either the “Total Satisfaction Return Policy” or the thirty-day period in which a consumer may exercise his or her right to return the product. Rather, this policy is explained, if at all, in a distinct section of the terms and conditions agreement, which confusingly informed plaintiffs that “Dell Branded Hardware systems and parts that are purchased directly from Dell by an end-user Customer may be returned by Customer in accordance with Dell’s ‘Total Satisfaction Return Policy’ in effect on the date of the invoice.”  . . . We believe the hearing justice rightly concluded that although “Dell does provide a ‘total satisfaction policy’ whereby a customer may return the computer, this return policy does not mention the customer’s ability to return based on their unwillingness to comply with the terms.”</p>
<p id="032e3fca-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="205" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-205">p. 205</span>In reviewing the language of the terms and conditions agreement it cannot be said that it was reasonably apparent to the plaintiffs that they could reject the terms simply by returning the goods. We believe that too many inferential steps were required of the plaintiffs and too many of the relevant provisions were left ambiguous. We are not persuaded that a reasonably prudent offeree would understand that by keeping the Dell computer he or she was agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions agreement and retained, for a specified time, the power to reject the terms by returning the product. Because we hold that the hearing justice properly denied the defendants’ motion to compel arbitration on the ground that the plaintiffs did not agree to be bound by the terms and conditions agreement, we need not discuss any of the alternative grounds the hearing justice offered for denying the defendants’ motion to compel arbitration . . . .</p>

ProCD, Inc. v. Zeidenberg, 86 F.3d 1447 (7th Cir. 1996); Hill v. Gateway, Inc., 105 F.3d 1147 (7th Cir. 1997). Those decisions are based on two propositions about offer and acceptance. First, when a purchaser places an order in person, by telephone or over the Internet, the purchaser has <i>not</i> made an offer. Instead, the vendor makes the offer by shipping the product to the purchaser with the vendor’s terms of sale included. Second, the vendor is the “master of the offer.” If the vendor’s offer states that the purchaser accepts the offer by retaining the product beyond the period of time set forth in the vendor’s terms of sale, the purchaser is bound by the vendor’s terms if he does not return the product within that period. Judge Easterbrook stated in <i>ProCD</i>:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="032e66e1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What then does the current version of the UCC have to say? We think that the place to start is §2-204(1): “A contract for sale of goods may be made in any manner sufficient to show agreement, including conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of such a contract.” A vendor, as master of the offer, may invite acceptance by conduct, and may propose limitations on the kind of conduct that constitutes acceptance. A buyer may accept by performing the acts the vendor proposes to treat as acceptance. And that is what happened. ProCD proposed a contract that a buyer would accept by using the software after having an opportunity to read the license at leisure. This Zeidenberg did. He had no choice, because the software splashed the license on the screen and would not let him proceed without indicating acceptance. So although the <span title="206" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-206">p. 206</span>district judge was right to say that a contract can be, and often is, formed simply by paying the price and walking out of the store, the UCC permits contracts to be formed in other ways. ProCD proposed such a different way, and without protest Zeidenberg agreed. Ours is not a case in which a consumer opens a package to find an insert saying “you owe us an extra $10,000” and the seller files suit to collect. Any buyer finding such a demand can prevent formation of the contract by returning the package, as can any consumer who concludes that the terms of the license make the software worth less than the purchase price. Nothing in the UCC requires a seller to maximize the buyer’s net gains.</p>

<p id="032e66e3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the <i>DeFontes</i> court asserts, many other courts have accepted this reasoning. However, many scholarly commentators have been highly critical of Judge Easterbrook’s reasoning. See William H. Lawrence, Rolling Contracts Rolling over Contract Law, 41 San Diego L. Rev. 1099, 1109 n.51 (2004) (citing authorities). Among other criticisms, they have pointed out that Judge Easterbrook failed to explain why the vendor rather than the purchaser should be considered to be the offeror, especially when the natural understanding of the transaction is that the purchaser is offering to buy the product and the vendor accepts by charging the purchaser for the product and by shipping the goods. This latter view of the transaction finds support in UCC §2-206, which provides that an offer may be accepted by prompt shipment of goods.

<p id="032e66e4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To assure a buyer a reasonable opportunity to become aware of a vendor’s otherwise invisible terms, the confusion, doubt, and controversy attending the rolling contract theory clearly requires its rejection. The theory is not only unnecessary to assure efficiency; at a minimum, its failure to alert the buyer to expect later contract terms undermines the buyer’s opportunity to become aware of such terms. There is no need to continue the deliberate misconstructions of statutes or precedent that the theory requires. Nor is it simply a matter of the number of major flaws in the theory. It is systemically incapable of providing reasonably clear and effective guidelines. An effective response to the question of the operative effect of boilerplate terms that accompany the goods or appear only after the goods have been received should not require a discussion of several theories. The irrationality and attendant confusion of the rolling theory will continue to preclude its effective assimilation. A confusing legal reaction to the felt needs of society has no redeeming virtue.</p>

Gateway, Inc.</i> Perhaps the leading case rejecting Judge Easterbrook’s reasoning in <i>ProCD</i> and <i>Hill</i>, is Klocek v. Gateway, Inc., 104 F. Supp. 2d 1332 (D. Kan. 2000), also cited and quoted in the <i>DeFontes</i> opinion. In that case, the court held that it was the purchaser rather than the vendor who made the offer:</p>

<p id="032e66e7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> . . . [T]he Seventh Circuit provided no explanation for its conclusion that “the vendor is the master of the offer.” See <i>ProCD</i>, 86 F.3d at 1452 (citing nothing in support of proposition); <i>Hill</i>, 105 F.3d at 1149 (citing <i>ProCD</i>). In typical consumer transactions, the purchaser is the offeror, and the vendor is the offeree. See Brown Mach., Div. of John Brown, Inc. v. Hercules, Inc., 770 S.W.2d 416, 419 (Mo. App. 1989) (as general rule orders are considered offers to purchase) . . . . While it is possible for the vendor to be the offeror, see <i>Brown Machine</i>, 770 S.W.2d at 419 (price quote can amount to offer if it reasonably appears from quote that assent to quote is all that is needed to ripen offer into contract), Gateway provides no factual evidence which would support such a finding in this case. The Court therefore assumes for purposes of the motion to dismiss that plaintiff offered to purchase the computer (either in person or through catalog order) and that Gateway accepted plaintiff’s offer (either by completing the sales transaction in person or by agreeing to ship and/or shipping the computer to plaintiff).</p>

<p id="032e66e8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">104 F. Supp. 2d at 1340. Under this reasoning, shrinkwrap terms found in the box containing the vendor’s product are merely proposals for additions to an already-formed contract, governed by UCC §2-207(2). In a transaction involving a consumer purchaser and a merchant seller, the merchant’s terms would not become part of the contract unless agreed to by the consumer. If the transaction were between two merchants, the terms might become part of the contract, but would not do so if any of the three situations set forth in §2-207(2) applied, as discussed earlier in the <i>Paul Gottlieb</i> case and notes. In particular, any terms proposed by the vendor that materially altered the contract would <i>not</i> automatically become part of the contract, even between merchants.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="032e66e9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Policy considerations</i>. Judge Easterbrook based his legal analysis on the policy argument that contracting through standard forms is efficient and socially desirable, and should be facilitated by the law. In characterizing the vendor as the offeror and the purchaser’s conduct as an acceptance, he relied on the fact that in the modern market place it is common for payment to precede the delivery of contract terms, citing contracts for air transportation and insurance as examples. <i>Hill,</i> 105 F.3d at 1149. But important policy considerations also support the approach in cases such as <i>Klocek</i>. Contract law is traditionally said to be based on mutual consent. To claim that a purchaser who receives a product and only thereafter is informed of the terms of sale has “consented” to those terms simply by failing to return the product strains the concept of consent — some would argue, to the breaking point. In addition, Judge Easterbrook’s approach enables vendors to dictate the terms of <span title="208" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-208">p. 208</span>the transaction. It is interesting to note that when referring to a concededly unreasonable term that a vendor might include — payment of an additional $10,000 for the product — Judge Easterbrook appears to require the purchaser to return the product in order to avoid being bound even by this term of sale. (See his language quoted in Note 1, above.) Finally, even if the reasoning used in <i>Klocek</i> were to prevail, vendors could respond to avoid the consequences of the decision and still bind purchasers to their terms. Indeed, the court in <i>Klocek</i> expressly recognized this fact:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="032e8cfa-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court is mindful of the practical considerations which are involved in commercial transactions, but it is not unreasonable for a vendor to clearly communicate to a buyer — at the time of sale — either the complete terms of the sale or the fact that the vendor will propose additional terms as a condition of sale, if that be the case.</p>

<p id="032e8cfb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">104 F. Supp. 2d at 1341, n.14.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="032e8cfc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Is</i> <b><i>Klocek</i>
</b> <i>or</i> <b><i>Hill</i>
</b> <i>better for consumers?</i> While the decision in <i>Klocek</i> may appear to give purchasers, particularly consumer purchasers, greater rights than the decisions in <i>Hill</i> and <i>ProCD</i>, that might not always be the case. Under the <i>Hill</i>/<i>ProCD</i> approach, purchasers are not bound contractually until they receive both the product and the seller’s terms of sale, inspect them (if they choose to do so) for a period of time, and decide whether to keep the product or return it. Under <i>Klocek</i>, both parties are bound when the vendor accepts payment. If <i>Klocek</i> were to be the controlling rule, purchasers might lose the right to cancel the sale within the period of time specified by the vendor for return of the product. On the other hand, if the seller’s additional terms did not apply because the <i>Klocek</i> analysis was used, even if the consumer did not have a contractual right to simply avoid the contract, she might under the general provisions of the UCC have the right to return it in certain circumstances or to seek damages for defective performance. See generally UCC §§2-601 through 2-608; §§2-714 and 2-715. Which would you prefer: (1) a contract in which the seller dictates the terms, subject to some limitations discussed below, but in which you have the ability to cancel the sale within a specified period after receiving the product (assuming you are aware that you do have that right, that is); or (2) a contract that consists of the terms on which you actually agree with the vendor plus the implied-in-law terms that apply in the absence of agreement, but under which you do not necessarily have the right to cancel within a designated period after receiving the product? As the preceding analysis indicates, contract formation in the rolling-contract situation involves competing legal and policy arguments over which reasonable people could disagree.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="032e8cfd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Regulation of unfair terms</i>. In a number of the cases cited in <i>DeFontes</i>, you can find examples of vendors overreaching to include in standard form documents terms that are unreasonable and effectively deny purchasers the opportunity for a hearing before even an arbitration tribunal. We examine legal doctrines in later chapters that can be used by courts to invalidate extremely unreasonable terms found in vendors’ terms of sale, even if those <span title="209" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-209">p. 209</span>terms of sale generally govern the transaction. See Robert A. Hillman &amp; Jeffrey J. Rachlinski, Standard-Form Contracting in the Electronic Age, 77 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 429 (2002) (arguing that existing law regarding standard form contracts provides sufficient protection for purchasers). It is interesting to note that other countries have adopted a more regulatory approach to standard form contracts than the United States. For example, in the European Union, standard form contracts are subject to several directives issued by the European Commission that invalidate particularly oppressive provisions. See Robert L. Oakley, Fairness in Electronic Contracting: Minimum Standards for Non-Negotiated Contracts, 42 Hous. L. Rev. 1041 (2005); Jane K. Winn &amp; Brian H. Bix, Diverging Perspectives on Electronic Contracting in the U.S. and E.U., 54 Clev. St. L. Rev. 175 (2006). Recent full treatments of this area include Margaret Jane Radin, Boilerplate: The Fine Print, Vanishing Rights, and the Rule of Law (Princeton Univ. Press 2012), and Nancy S. Kim, Wrap Contracts: Foundations and Ramifications (Oxford Univ. Press 2013). A good general discussion of the state of contract law in the present technological age can be found in an article by Prof. William J. Woodward, Jr., “Contraps,” 66 Hastings L.J. 915 (2015).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="032e8cfe-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Does the UCC apply?</i> Contracts for the sale of consumer durables, such as refrigerators or washing machines, that come with shrinkwrap terms are clearly subject to the UCC because such products are “goods” under the Code. UCC §2-105(1) (“all things  . . . movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale”). The status of software, on the other hand, is unclear. For many years software was sold on disks; the disks were goods, but the disk itself was not the product and its value was an inconsequential portion of the overall value of the transaction. Today, most software is downloaded over the Internet, so even a disk may not be present. Computers constitute goods under Article 2 because they are tangible moveable things, but computers typically come loaded with software, producing uncertainty regarding the application of the UCC. Most courts that have dealt with the issue have either applied the UCC to all of these transactions or have indicated that the result would be the same even if common law principles applied. See, e.g. Specht v. Netscape Communication Corp., 306 F.3d 17, 29 n.13 (2nd Cir. 2002).</p></li>

<p id="032e8d07-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant Provide Commerce, Inc. (Provide), appeals from an order denying its petition to compel arbitration of certain consumer fraud claims brought by plaintiff Brett Long (Plaintiff) on behalf of himself and a putative class of <span title="210" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-210">p. 210</span>California consumers who purchased flower arrangements through Provide’s Web site, ProFlowers.com. Provide sought to compel arbitration based on a provision contained in the company’s “Terms of Use,” which were viewable via a hyperlink displayed at the bottom of each page on the ProFlowers.com Web site.</p>
<p id="032e8d08-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Terms of Use on ProFlowers.com fall into a category of Internet contracts commonly referred to as “browsewrap” agreements. Unlike the other common form of Internet contract—known as “clickwrap” agreements—browsewrap agreements do not require users to affirmatively click a button to confirm their assent to the agreement’s terms; instead, a user’s assent is inferred from his or her use of the Web site. Because assent must be inferred, the determination of whether a binding browsewrap agreement has been formed depends on whether the user had actual or constructive knowledge of the Web site’s terms and conditions.</p>
<p id="032eb419-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff opposed the petition to compel arbitration on the ground that he was never prompted to assent to the Terms of Use, nor did he actually read them, prior to placing his order on ProFlowers.com. The trial court concluded the Terms of Use hyperlinks were too inconspicuous to impose constructive knowledge on Plaintiff, and denied the petition as such. We likewise find the hyperlinks and the overall design of the ProFlowers.com Web site would not have put a reasonably prudent Internet user on notice of Provide’s Terms of]Use, and Plaintiff therefore did not unambiguously assent to the subject arbitration provision simply by placing an order on ProFlowers.com. We affirm.</p>

<p id="032eb41b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no material dispute about the underlying facts. Provide is an online retailer that owns and operates several Web sites, including ProFlowers.com. Through ProFlowers.com, Provide advertises and sells a variety of floral products, which are shipped to order from the grower to the online customer.</p>
<p id="032eb41c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff alleges he purchased a floral arrangement on ProFlowers.com, which had been depicted and advertised on the Web site as a “completed assembled product,” but which was delivered as a “do-it yourself kit in a box requiring assembly by the recipient.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN120A8_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N120A8_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">2</a></span> Based on this allegation, Plaintiff sued Provide in the superior court, asserting claims for violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act (Civ. Code, § 1750 et seq.) and unfair competition law (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, § 17200 et seq.) on behalf of himself and a putative class of California consumers who purchased similarly advertised floral arrangements on ProFlowers.com.</p>
<p id="032eb41e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Provide moved to compel arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.), arguing Plaintiff was bound by the Terms of Use for ProFlowers.com, including the dispute resolution provision contained therein. Provide’s evidence, consisting of a series of screenshots from the ProFlowers.<span title="211" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-211">p. 211</span>com Web site, showed that at the time Plaintiff placed his order, the Terms of Use were available via a capitalized and underlined hyperlink titled “<u>TERMS OF USE</u>” located at the bottom of each Web page. The hyperlink was displayed in what appears to have been a light green typeface on the Web site’s lime green background, and was situated among 14 other capitalized and underlined hyperlinks of the same color, font and size.</p>
<p id="032eb41f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Provide’s evidence also showed that, to complete his order, Plaintiff was required to input information and click through a multi-Web-page “checkout flow.” The checkout flow screenshots show the customer information fields and click-through buttons displayed in a bright white box set against the Web site’s lime green background. At the bottom of the white box was a notice indicating, “<b>Your order is safe and secure</b>,” displayed next to a “VeriSign Secured” logo. Below the white box was a dark green bar with a hyperlink titled “SITE FEEDBACK” displayed in light green typeface. Finally, below the dark green bar, at the bottom of each checkout flow page, were two hyperlinks titled “<u>PRIVACY POLICY</u>” and “<u>TERMS OF USE</u>,” displayed in the same light green typeface on the Web site’s lime green background.</p>
<p id="032eb420-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After Plaintiff placed his order on ProFlowers.com, Provide sent him an e-mail confirming the order. The e-mail, beginning from the top, displayed the ProFlowers logo alongside the title “order confirmation.” This was followed by a dark green bar with several hyperlinks to apparent product offerings titled “Birthday,” “Anniversary,” “Get Well,” “Roses,” “Plants,” and “Gourmet Gifts.” Next, the e-mail displayed a light green bar thanking Plaintiff for his order, followed by order summary information, including the order number, shipping address, delivery date, the product ordered, and a billing breakdown for the product, delivery charge, tax, and total charge. The order details were followed by two banner advertisements, then a notification regarding online account management services, with four hyperlinks to account management pages on ProFlowers.com. Another dark green bar with the text “Our Family of Brands” followed the account management hyperlinks, then six brand logos for “ProFlowers,” “<i>red</i>
<span class="epub-small-caps">envelope</span>,” “ProPlants,” “Shari’s Berries,” “<span class="epub-small-caps">Cherry Moon Farms</span>,” and “personalcreations.com.” Next, the e-mail included a paragraph listing customer service contact information in small grey typeface. Then, in the same grey typeface, were two hyperlinks titled “<u>Privacy Policy</u>” and “<u>Terms</u>.” Finally, the e-mail listed Provide’s corporate address, again in the same grey typeface.</p>
<p id="032eb421-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to Plaintiff’s declaration in opposition to Provide’s petition to compel arbitration, Plaintiff “did not notice a reference of any kind to ProFlowers ‘Terms and Conditions’ nor a hyperlink to ProFlowers ‘Terms of Use’” when he purchased flowers for delivery on ProFlowers.com. Had Plaintiff noticed the hyperlink and clicked on it, he would have been taken to a page containing the full text of the Terms of Use, which began with the following notice: “<b>By using any one of our Sites, you  . . .  acknowledge that you have read, understand, and expressly agree to be legally bound by these Terms and Conditions</b>.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN120E0_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N120E0_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">3</a></span> <span title="212" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-212">p. 212</span>Later, under the heading “Dispute Resolution,” Plaintiff would have found the following arbitration provision: “<b><i>Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes</i>
</b>: BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SITES, YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT ANY LEGAL CLAIM, DISPUTE OR OTHER CONTROVERSY BETWEEN YOU AND PROVIDE COMMERCE ARISING OUT OF OR OTHERWISE RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE SITES  . . .  SHALL BE RESOLVED IN CONFIDENTIAL BINDING ARBITRATION CONDUCTED BEFORE ONE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATOR FROM THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (‘AAA’), RATHER THAN IN A COURT, AS DESCRIBED HEREIN.  . . .  YOU SPECIFICIALLY AGREE THAT YOU ARE BOUND TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES IN ARBITRATION, AND YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE VOLUNTARILY AND KNOWINGLY FORFEITING YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND TO OTHERWISE PROCEED IN A LAWSUIT IN STATE OR FEDERAL COURT.”</p>
<p id="032edb33-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff argued he was not bound by the foregoing arbitration provision because he neither had notice of nor assented to the Terms of Use. In response, Provide argued the placement of the Terms of Use hyperlinks, particularly within the checkout flow, coupled with the hyperlink to “Terms” in the subsequent order confirmation e-mail, was sufficiently conspicuous to put Plaintiff on inquiry notice as to the contents of the agreement. Accordingly, Provide maintained Plaintiff’s decision to continue with the order, whether he took the time to review the Terms of Use or not, was sufficient to establish his assent to be bound by the arbitration and venue provisions contained therein. The trial court agreed with Plaintiff, concluding the hyperlinks were too inconspicuous to put a reasonably prudent Internet consumer on inquiry notice. Provide now appeals this order.</p>

<p id="032edb39-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“‘Unlike a clickwrap agreement, a browsewrap agreement does not require the user to manifest assent to the terms and conditions expressly  . . .  [a] party instead gives his assent simply by using the website.’ [Citation.] Indeed, ‘in a pure-form browsewrap agreement, “the website will contain a notice that—by merely using the services of, obtaining information from, or initiating applications within the website—the user is agreeing to and is bound by the site’s terms of service.’” Thus, ‘by visiting the website—something that the user has already done—the user agrees to the Terms of Use not listed on the site itself but available only by clicking a hyperlink.’ ‘The defining feature of browsewrap agreements is that the user can continue to use the website or its services without visiting the page hosting the browsewrap agreement or even knowing that such a webpage exists.’ ‘Because no affirmative action is required by the website user to agree to the terms of a contract other than his or her use of the website, the determination of the validity of the browsewrap contract depends on whether the user has actual or constructive knowledge of a website’s terms and conditions.’” (<i>Nguyen, supra</i>, 763 F.3d at p. 1176.) More to the point here, absent actual notice, “the validity of [a] browsewrap agreement turns on whether the website puts a reasonably prudent user on inquiry notice of the terms of the contract.” (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1177.)</p>
<p id="032f024a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With these foundational legal principles in place, we turn our focus to the specifics of the browsewrap agreement in the instant case, and whether the design of Provide’s Web site and order confirmation e-mail were sufficient to conclude Plaintiff agreed to be bound by the Terms of Use and arbitration provision contained therein simply by placing his order on ProFlowers.com.</p>

<p id="032f024c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Provide does not dispute Plaintiff’s testimony that he had no actual knowledge of the Terms of Use when he placed his order on ProFlowers.com.

(See <i>Nguyen, supra</i>, 763 F.3d at p. 1177.) Because the material evidence consists exclusively of screenshots from the Web site and order confirmation e-mail, and the authenticity of these screenshots is not subject to factual dispute, we review the issue de novo as a pure question of law. (See <i>HM DG, supra</i>, 219 Cal. App. 4th at p. 1109 [“‘if the material facts are certain or undisputed, the existence of a contract is a question for the court to decide’”].)</p>
<p id="032f024d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It appears that no California appellate court has yet addressed what sort of Web site design elements would be necessary or sufficient to deem a browsewrap agreement valid in the absence of actual notice. Accordingly, in addition to the general contract principles discussed above, our analysis is largely guided by two federal cases from the Second and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals, each of which considered the enforceability of a browsewrap agreement applying the objective manifestation of assent analysis dictated by California law. (See <i>Specht, supra</i>, 306 F.3d at p. 30, fn. 13; <i>Nguyen, supra</i>, 763 F.3d at p. 1175.) In keeping with the principles articulated in these authorities, we conclude the design of the ProFlowers.com Web site, even when coupled with the hyperlink contained in the confirmation e-mail, was insufficient to put Plaintiff on inquiry notice of the subject Terms of Use.</p>
<p id="032f024e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Specht</i>, the Second Circuit declined to enforce an arbitration provision contained in a software licensing browsewrap agreement where the hyperlink to the agreement appeared on “a submerged screen” below the “‘Download’” button that the plaintiffs clicked to initiate the software download. (<i>Specht, supra</i>, 306 F.3d at pp. 30–32.) After reviewing California contract law, the <i>Specht</i> court acknowledged that a user’s act of clicking a download button, combined with “‘circumstances sufficient to put a prudent man upon inquiry’” as to the existence of licensing terms, would constitute a sufficient manifestation of assent to be bound. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 31.) However, the court was quick to point out that the opposite must also be true—that “a consumer’s clicking on a download button does not communicate assent to contractual terms if the offer did not make clear to the consumer that clicking on the download button would signify assent to those terms.” (<i>Id.</i> at pp. 29–30.) The design of the defendant’s Web site, the <i>Specht</i> court concluded, exemplified the latter circumstance.</p>
<p id="032f024f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Though the Web site advised users to “‘Please review and agree to the terms of the  . . .  software license agreement before downloading and using the software,’” the <i>Specht</i> court emphasized that users would have encountered this advisement only if they scrolled down to the screen below the Web site’s invitation to download the software by clicking the download button. (<i>Specht, supra</i>, 306 F.3d at p. 23, italics omitted.) This meant that when the plaintiffs clicked the download button, they “were responding to an offer that did not carry an immediately visible notice of the existence of license terms or require unambiguous manifestation of assent to those terms.” (<i>Id.</i> at p. 31.) The fact that users might have noticed from the position of the scroll bar that an unexplored portion of the Web page remained below the download button did not change <span title="215" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-215">p. 215</span>the reasonableness calculation. Under the circumstances presented, “where consumers [were] urged to download free software at the immediate click of a button,” the <i>Specht</i> court concluded placing the notice of licensing terms on a submerged page “‘tended to conceal the fact that [downloading the software] was an express acceptance of [the defendant’s] rules and regulations.’” (<i>Id.</i> at p. 32.) Thus, notwithstanding what the plaintiffs might have found had they taken “‘as much time as they need[ed]’ to scroll through multiple screens on a webpage” (<i>ibid.</i>), the <i>Specht</i> court held that “a reasonably prudent offeree in plaintiffs’ position would not have known or learned  . . .  of the reference to [the software’s] license terms hidden below the ‘Download’ button on the next screen” (<i>id.</i> at p. 35).</p>
<p id="032f0250-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More than a decade after the Second Circuit decided <i>Specht</i>, the Ninth Circuit in <i>Nguyen</i> considered whether the conspicuous placement of a “‘Terms of Use’” hyperlink, standing alone, would be sufficient to put an Internet consumer on inquiry notice. (<i>Nguyen, supra</i>, 763 F.3d at p. 1178.) Unlike in <i>Specht</i>, the hyperlink in <i>Nguyen</i> was visible “without scrolling” on some of the Web site’s pages, while on others “the hyperlink [was] close enough to the ‘Proceed with Checkout’ button that a user would have to bring the link within his field of vision” to complete an online order. (<i>Ibid.</i>) These differences with <i>Specht</i> notwithstanding, the <i>Nguyen</i> court concluded the plaintiff’s act of placing an order did not constitute an unambiguous manifestation of assent to be bound by the browsewrap agreement, holding “proximity or conspicuousness of the hyperlink alone is not enough to give rise to constructive notice.” (<i>Ibid.</i>) The court reasoned that <i>Specht</i> had only identified a circumstance that was <i>not sufficient</i> to impart inquiry notice—where the only reference to license terms appeared on a submerged screen. (<i>Ibid.</i>) But in cases where courts had “relied on the proximity of the hyperlink <i>to enforce</i> a browsewrap agreement,” the <i>Nguyen</i> court explained, those Web sites had “also included something more to capture the user’s attention and secure her assent.” (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1178, fn. 1, italics added.) Typically that “something more” had taken the form of an explicit textual notice warning users to “‘Review terms’” or admonishing users that by clicking a button to complete the transaction “‘you agree to the terms and conditions in the [agreement].’” (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1178 &amp; fn. 1.) From those cases, the <i>Nguyen</i> court derived the following bright-line rule for determining the validity of browsewrap agreements: “[W]here a website makes its terms of use available via a conspicuous hyperlink on every page of the website but otherwise provides no notice to users nor prompts them to take any affirmative action to demonstrate assent, even close proximity of the hyperlink to relevant buttons users must click on—without more—is insufficient to give rise to constructive notice.” (<i>Id.</i> at pp. 1178–1179.)</p>
<p id="032f2961-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Provide argues we should disregard <i>Nguyen</i> as an outlier case, and follow <i>Specht</i> to the extent it suggests a conspicuous hyperlink that provides “‘immediately visible notice’” of a browsewrap agreement is sufficient, standing alone, to put a reasonably prudent Internet consumer on inquiry notice of the agreement’s terms. In that regard, Provide observes that “in <i>Specht</i>, the <i>only</i> reference to license terms appeared <i>on a submerged screen out of sight to users when they clicked on buttons to download software</i>.” In contrast, Provide argues the Terms of Use hyperlink on ProFlowers.<span title="216" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-216">p. 216</span>com “is immediately visible on the checkout flow, is viewable without scrolling, and located next to several fields that the website user is required to fill out and the buttons he must click to complete an order.” Given this distinction, Provide argues the hyperlink was sufficiently conspicuous to “put a reasonable user on notice of the Terms of Use.” We disagree.</p>
<p id="032f2962-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>(4)</b> Though it may be that an especially observant Internet consumer could spot the Terms of Use hyperlinks on some checkout flow pages without scrolling, that quality alone cannot be all that is required to establish the existence of an enforceable browsewrap agreement. Rather, as the <i>Specht</i> court observed, “[r]easonably conspicuous notice of the existence of contract terms and unambiguous manifestation of assent to those terms by consumers are essential if electronic bargaining is to have integrity and credibility.” (<i>Specht, supra</i>, 306 F.3d at p. 35.) Here, the Terms of Use hyperlinks—their placement, color, size and other qualities relative to the ProFlowers.com Web site’s overall design—are simply too inconspicuous to meet that standard.</p>
<p id="032f2963-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>(5)</b> Indeed, our review of the screenshots reveals how difficult it is to find the Terms of Use hyperlinks in the checkout flow <i>even when one is looking for them</i>.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN121F8_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N121F8_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">4</a></span> This of course is to say nothing of how observant an Internet consumer must be to discover the hyperlinks in the usual circumstance of using ProFlowers.com <i>to purchase flowers</i>, without any forewarning that he or she should also be on the lookout for a reference to Terms of Use somewhere on the Web site’s various pages. Contrary to Provide’s characterization, the subject hyperlinks in the checkout flow are not “located next to” the fields and buttons a consumer must interact with to complete his order. Those fields and buttons are contained in a separate bright white box in the center of the page that contrasts sharply with the Web site’s lime green background. To find a Terms of Use hyperlink in the checkout flow, a consumer placing an order must (1) remove attention from the fields in which he or she is asked to enter his information; (2) look below the buttons he must click to proceed with the order; (3) look even further below a “VeriSign Secured” logo and notification advising that his or her “<b>order is safe and secure</b>,” which itself includes a hyperlink to “<b>
<u>Click here</u>
</b> for more details”; (4) look still further below a thick dark green bar with a hyperlink for “SITE FEEDBACK”; and (5) finally find the “<u>TERMS OF USE</u>” hyperlink situated to the right of another hyperlink for the Web site’s “<u>PRIVACY POLICY</u>,” both of which appear in the same font and light green typeface that, to the unwary flower purchaser, could blend in with the Web site’s lime green background. True, on a handful of these pages no scrolling is required to complete the hunt. But that, in our assessment, does not change the practical reality that the checkout flow is laid out “‘in such a manner that it tended to conceal the fact that [placing an order] was an express acceptance of [Provide’s] rules and regulations.’” (<i>Specht, supra</i>, 306 F.3d at p. 32.)</p>
<p id="032f2965-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As for Provide’s contention that the subsequent order confirmation e-mail somehow provides the notice that was missing from the checkout flow, again, <span title="217" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-217">p. 217</span>we disagree. Unlike the hyperlink on some checkout flow pages, the screenshots suggest the hyperlink in the e-mail is located on a submerged page, requiring the customer to scroll below layers of order summary details, advertisement banners, hyperlinks to “convenient account management services,” several logos for Provide’s “Family of Brands,” and customer service contact information to finally find a reference to “<u>Terms</u>” printed in grey typeface on a white background. This is not the sort of conspicuous alert that can be expected to put a reasonably prudent Internet consumer on notice to investigate whether disputes related to his or her order will be subject to binding arbitration.</p>
<p id="032f2966-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>(6)</b> While the lack of conspicuousness resolves the instant matter, we agree with the <i>Nguyen</i> court that, to establish the enforceability of a browsewrap agreement, a textual notice should be required to advise consumers that continued use of a Web site will constitute the consumer’s agreement to be bound by the Web site’s terms of use. (See <i>Nguyen, supra</i>, 763 F.3d at pp. 1178–1179.) In our view, the problem with merely displaying a hyperlink in a prominent or conspicuous place is that, without notifying consumers that the linked page contains binding contractual terms, the phrase “terms of use” may have no meaning or a different meaning to a large segment of the Internet-using public. In other words, a conspicuous “terms of use” hyperlink may not be enough to alert a reasonably prudent Internet consumer to click the hyperlink.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN12228_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N12228_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">5</a></span> As the <i>Nguyen</i> court observed, “[w]hile failure to read a contract before agreeing to its terms does not relieve a party of its obligations under the contract, [citation], the onus must be on website owners to put users on notice of the terms to which they wish to bind consumers. Given the <i>breadth of the range of technological savvy of online purchasers</i>, consumers cannot be expected to ferret out hyperlinks to terms and conditions to which they have no reason to suspect they will be bound.” (<i>Nguyen</i>, at p. 1179, italics added.) Though we need not resolve the issue here given the inconspicuousness of the Terms of Use hyperlinks on the ProFlowers.com Web site, in our view the bright-line rule established by <i>Nguyen</i> is necessary to ensure that Internet consumers are on inquiry notice of a browsewrap agreement’s terms, regardless of each consumer’s degree of technological savvy. Online retailers would be well-advised to include a conspicuous textual notice with their terms of use hyperlinks going forward.</p>
<p id="032f2968-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>C. Plaintiff Did Not Agree to the Venue Provision Either</b></p>
<p id="032f2969-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the alternative, Provide argues the trial court erred by denying its request to transfer venue to San Diego pursuant to a forum selection clause in the Terms of Use. That clause, which is itself presented as an alternative to a class arbitration waiver, provides: “[I]f an arbitrator deems your Waiver of Class Arbitration to be invalid or unenforceable, then  . . .  you expressly acknowledge and agree that: (ii) all Disputes shall be resolved by a state or federal court located in the county of San Diego, California.” The trial court denied the request to transfer venue for the same reason it denied the petition to compel arbitration—namely, <span title="218" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-218">p. 218</span>because Plaintiff did not agree to the Terms of Use, he did not agree to the forum selection clause contained therein.</p>
<p id="032f296a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Provide argues the trial court’s reasoning was flawed, because forum selection clauses are presumptively valid. Thus, Provide maintains, though it had the burden to establish an enforceable arbitration agreement, “the presumption in favor of [forum selection clause] enforcement shift[ed] the burden to [Plaintiff]  . . .  to show why the provision should not be enforced.” Insofar as Plaintiff “fail[ed] to establish the unenforceability of the venue provision” in his opposition papers, Provide argues the trial court was required to enforce the provision and transfer the action to San Diego. We disagree.</p>
<p id="032f507b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Provide’s reliance on the presumptive validity of forum selection clauses <i>in otherwise enforceable contracts</i> proves too much. Contrary to Provide’s implicit premise, the presumption of validity is not a substitute for proof of the resisting party’s objective manifestation of assent to the larger contract. If it were, a party would establish the existence of a binding contract simply by showing that the contract contained a presumptively valid forum selection clause—an obviously absurd result. The trial court was correct; because Plaintiff was not bound by Provide’s Terms of Use, he also could not have been bound by the forum selection clause contained therein.</p>

<p id="032f77a2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The program listed a website where David could purchase the CarpetWizard: http://www.morek.com/carpetwizard. When David accessed the CarpetWizard, Inc. (or CWI) website, he saw pictures of various vacuum cleaners and similar devices, with specifications for each of the products. Below the pictures of all the products was the following statement: <b>MONEY BACK GUARANTEE IF NOT COMPLETELY SATISFIED WITH OUR PRODUCT.</b> Immediately below the guarantee was a button also in all caps and bold face stating <b>PLACE AN ORDER.</b> Several other buttons, in somewhat smaller, nonbold type, were located at the bottom of the page. One of these buttons was labeled “contract terms and product guarantee.” David clicked on the button, scrolled part of the way through the document, saw that it was fairly long with some provisions in all caps bold while others were in regular type. Included in the document were the following: (1) Any claim for refund of your purchase price under our money back guarantee must be made within five days of the buyer’s receipt of the merchandise, and must be accompanied by all of the merchandise in the original packing case, sent postage prepaid and insured to the seller’s factory in Florida (regular nonbold type); (2) a disclaimer of any liability on CWI’s part for any consequential damage resulting from the use or misuse of any CWI products (<b>IN BOLD ALL CAPS)</b>; and (3) a statement that any and all disputes arising out of the buyer’s purchase of any CWI product must be submitted to arbitration in Florida (<b>IN BOLD ALL CAPS).</b> David clicked the back button, returned to the home page, clicked the button to <b>PLACE AN ORDER,</b> and moved to a page that asked for credit card and delivery information. David entered this information and clicked the button at the bottom of the page which stated “complete order.” A page appeared confirming David’s entry of credit card and delivery information. At the bottom of the page appeared another button which stated: “Confirm order. Your order is not complete until you click here.” David clicked this button and a message appeared on the screen with his order confirmation number. He was told that he would receive an email when his order was shipped. He received the confirming email the next day.</p>
<p id="032f77a3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two weeks later, the merchandise he had ordered was delivered. In the packing box, in addition to the CarpetWizard plus the sweeper and duster, was a booklet entitled “CONTRACT TERMS, PRODUCT GUARANTEE, AND INSTRUCTION MANUAL,” the contents of which consisted mostly of instructions for operating those products. However, the booklet repeated the three provisions outlined above that were found on the website. Attached to the <span title="221" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-221">p. 221</span>last page of the Instruction Manual was a tear-off card entitled “WARRANTY REGISTRATION.” The card stated: “Please fill out and return so that we may have a record of your purchase, to ensure that you receive updates regarding your product.” The card provided a space for the buyer to fill in the place and date of the purchase and the serial number of the CarpetWizard. The card then asked several questions about the buyer’s purchasing habits, followed by a space for the buyer’s signature, name, and address. David filled out the card, signed it, and mailed it back to CWI.</p>
<p id="032f77a4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A week after receiving the CarpetWizard, David got around to trying it out. After reading the instructions in the manual to be sure he was operating the machine correctly, David used the CarpetWizard to clean the rugs in his inn, starting with those in his own personal apartment. When it appeared to work as promised, he went on to use the machine on the rugs in the guest rooms and common areas of the inn. Within a few hours, several of the rugs appeared discolored and worn as a result of its operation. When David attempted to go over the affected areas again, in an effort to improve the result, the CarpetWizard short-circuited and caught fire. The machine itself was damaged beyond repair, as was the rug that David was cleaning at the time.</p>
<p id="032f77a5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the purpose of this question, ignore the application of UCC warranty law, any possible application of tort law, and the possibility that statutes or regulations (federal, state, or local) we have not studied might provide various types of protection for David in this case. Assuming that the damage to David’s rugs could be characterized as “consequential damage,” answer the following questions on the basis of general contract law and UCC Article 2.</p>

Frequent flyer programs, for example, may be governed by membership agreements that impose contractual duties on both sides of the bargain, exposing airlines and travelers alike to potential contractual liability. <i>See, e.g., Ginsberg v. Northwest, Inc.,</i> 653 F.3d 1033, 1035, 1040 (9th Cir. 2011); <i>Am. Airlines, Inc. v. Am. Coupon Exch., Inc.,</i> 721 F. Supp. 61, 63 (S.D.N.Y. l989). Here, however, the plaintiffs have not alleged an offer or contract involving reciprocal duties, and therefore they have not alleged a bilateral contract.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="032342ab-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN1069E_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" id="note-N1069E_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">2</a></span>&nbsp; . . . In <i>Wolens</i>, the Illinois Supreme Court recognized a contractual relationship between American Airlines and members of its frequent flyer program, stating, “When a member earns frequent flyer miles by flying on American or by doing business with American affiliates, a contractual relationship is formed which vests the frequent flyer with the right to earn specific travel awards.” 193 Ill.

To take advantage of the Camel Cash program, consumers were expected to purchase Camel cigarettes and accumulate Camel Cash certificates for a period of weeks, months or even years. <i>See</i> Compl. ¶ 29 (alleging that “[t]he number of Camel Cash certificates needed to obtain merchandise  . . . varied from as little as one hundred to many thousands,” and noting that RJR “further encouraged plaintiffs and other Class members to collect their Camel Cash (as opposed to redeeming them as soon as possible) because merchandise listed in defendant’s catalogs for redemption by a greater number of coupons was disproportionately more valuable than the merchandise which could be redeemed by fewer coupons”). Citing an offer for a reward as an example, Corbin explains that “a proposal is likely to be deemed to be an offer if it is foreseeable that the addressee of the proposal will rely upon it.” Corbin §2.2. This is so because a member of the public is unlikely to undertake substantial reliance in the absence of a binding commitment from the offeror — i.e., on the mere chance that the offeror will perform.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="032342b7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10706_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" id="note-N10706_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">5</a></span>&nbsp;That the alleged contract afforded RJR some discretion in performing does not compel the conclusion that the alleged contract is too indefinite to be enforced. See Restatement§ 34 cmt. a (“If the agreement is otherwise sufficiently definite to be a contract, it is not made invalid by the fact that it leaves particulars of performance to be specified by one of the parties.”); Corbin §4.4 (“[T]he fact that one of the parties reserves the power of fixing or varying the price or other performance is not fatal if the exercise of this power is subject to prescribed or implied limitations, as that the variation  . . . must be reasonable or in good faith.” (footnote omitted)); <i>Cal.

We note also that during oral argument on the preliminary objections, Pennsy’s counsel represented “it was understood by everybody that this [i.e., avoidance of disposal costs] was what American Ash was getting in return for [providing the AggRite for free].” Transcript of Proceedings, Feb. 1, 2005, at 14-15.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="0328e8a0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN111A7_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a" id="note-N111A7_2c3a7c72-297a-11e9-b09e-61e34f17141a">1</a></span>&nbsp;Mrs. Rogers has since died, and the cause is now captioned “GEORGE J.

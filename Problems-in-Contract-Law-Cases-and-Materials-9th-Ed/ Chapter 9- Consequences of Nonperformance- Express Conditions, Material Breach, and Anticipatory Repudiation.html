<div class="cc-section epub-section epub-anyhead" id="0397fda5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56">


<p id="0397fda6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While in earlier chapters we have focused on defenses to the contract as a whole, we turn now to a consideration of the performance obligations that a contract imposes. The Restatement (Second) in §235(2) defines “breach” as “any non-performance” of a contractual duty at a time “when performance of [that] duty . . . is due.” Comment <i>b</i> to that section states that performance is not due if for any reason nonperformance is “justified.” In one way or another, the sections of this chapter address those central questions: When is one party’s performance due, so that failure to perform will be a breach? When is nonperformance justified?</p>
<p id="0397fda7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first section of this chapter addresses the question whether, by the express terms of the parties’ agreement, performance by one party is a presently due obligation. This might involve simply the question of whether the time stated for performance has arrived — the day, perhaps even the hour. Often, however, the express terms of the agreement will state that performance is not due unless and until some specified event has taken place. If the agreement does so provide, then the performance is said to be “conditioned,” and the happening of that event is an “express condition” to the duty of performance. The use of express conditions as a drafting device is designed to protect one party (or possibly both parties) against various types of risk, involving the possibility that performance will be less advantageous than hoped for, or will be more difficult or even impossible in ways that might not otherwise offer an excuse from liability for nonperformance. For example, the typical contract for the purchase of residential real estate contains a clause making the buyer’s purchase obligation conditional on the buyer’s obtaining financing from a lending institution. If the buyer is unable to obtain financing despite a good faith effort, the buyer will not be obligated to purchase the property.</p>
<p id="039824b8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We will see, however, that sometimes a party does have a present duty of performance even though an express condition to that party’s duty has not <span title="804" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-804">p. 804</span>occurred. The nonoccurrence of a condition can be “excused” for a variety of reasons. For instance, if the buyer in our example made no effort whatever to obtain financing, a court might well hold that the buyer was obligated to purchase the property, the financing condition being excused because of his bad faith. When an express condition has simply failed to occur, the conditional duty never arises and the promisor is therefore justified in not performing. When nonoccurrence of the condition is <i>excused</i>, however, the conditional duty becomes an <i>un</i>conditional one, and the promisor’s failure to perform amounts to a breach.</p>
<p id="039824b9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second situation we will address in this chapter involves the relationship between the parties’ performance obligations. As we have seen, although some contracts are “unilateral” in form, the majority are probably “bilateral,” mutual exchanges of promises of future performance. In such a case, when the time for performance arrives, one party may fail to render all or some of its promised performance. What effect does that have on the performance obligation of the other? In a construction contract, for instance, the contractor agrees to construct a building according to certain specifications, while in return the owner agrees to pay the contractor, typically in installments of stated amounts payable at the completion of specified portions of the work. Suppose the owner fails to make one of those progress payments when it comes due. What effect does this have on the contractor? Does he simply have to continue construction and hope the owner will eventually make that payment as promised? Can he keep working, but at the same time bring suit for the promised payment? Can the contractor even go so far as to declare the contract at an end, sue the owner for damages, and go on to another job? Similar questions may arise from the other side as well. Suppose the contractor has ostensibly finished the construction as promised and has gone on to another project, but the owner finds the work done to be incomplete or inadequate. Is the owner nevertheless bound to pay the balance of the contract price? Can she simply withhold all payments not yet made until full performance is rendered?</p>
<p id="039824ba-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, the answers to questions like these are often found in the terms of the contract itself. If not, they will have to come from the rules of contract law, as applied to the court’s understanding of what is often a complicated and highly contested series of events. The law tends to focus on these underlying issues: What is the magnitude of the breach? What is its effect on the other party? What is the likelihood that the breach will be cured? In light of such factors as these, the law determines what responses by the nonbreaching party are or are not permissible.</p>
<p id="039824bb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The final section of this chapter will address a related but distinct situation: where the time for performance has not yet arrived, but the likelihood of nonperformance appears substantial. Sometimes one party to a contract will declare in advance, in no uncertain terms, his unwillingness or inability to perform his duties under that contract. Does the other party have to wait until the time for performance actually arrives before taking any legal action? Or can <span title="805" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-805">p. 805</span>she treat this “repudiation” as the equivalent of a present breach of contract and act accordingly?</p>

<p id="039824be-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this section of Chapter 9, we address the seemingly more clear-cut case where the parties have expressly agreed that the duty of one party (or, perhaps, both of them) should depend on the happening of one or more specified events. The conditioning event might be all or part of one party’s performance, but it could just as well be some event completely outside the control of either party. Often it will be an event over which one party has some control, albeit limited.</p>
<p id="039824bf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When an express condition is spelled out in a contract, it will often be a condition to the duty of only one of the parties, because that term has been included in the agreement to protect that party from having to perform in a situation where performance is for some reason less advantageous for her. Thus, for example, a real estate buyer’s performance obligation may be conditioned on its ability to obtain a favorable zoning variance, without which the property will be less useful to it. The buyer of a business may condition its duty to complete the purchase on the accuracy of the seller’s financial statements at the time of closing. Sometimes one party’s duty is conditioned on the other party’s giving certain types of notice or providing certain types of information in a particular form, or by a stated time. (This is particularly common in insurance contracts, but it is found in countless other situations as well.) Whatever the motive behind its insistence on a conditioning term, the party whose performance is so conditioned will be referred to in this context as the “obligor,” the one whose performance obligation is at issue. The other party will thus be the “obligee” — the one to whom the performance obligation is owed, and the one who is presumably attempting to enforce it.</p>

<p id="03984bda-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">enXco develops renewable energy projects throughout the United States, especially solar and wind projects. NSP is an electric and gas company that provides energy to customers throughout Minnesota and the Dakotas.</p>
<p id="03984bdb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">enXco and NSP entered into two contracts in October 2008. The contracts involved a wind-energy-generation project in North Dakota known as the Merricourt Project (“Project”). The parties termed the first contract the Developed Wind Project Purchase and Sale Agreement (PSA). Under the PSA, enXco agreed to develop the Project site, which included obtaining the requisite permits. During this initial phase of the Project, enXco owned the Project’s real estate and assets. Upon closing of the PSA, NSP would essentially purchase the Project’s real estate and assets for $15 million.</p>
<p id="03984bdc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second, much larger contract was the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Agreement (EPCA). Pursuant to the EPCA, NSP agreed to pay enXco over $350 million for engineering, procurement of infrastructure, construction, commissioning, start-up, and testing of the Project. The parties agree that one of the principal benefits of this two-contract structure was that neither party had an obligation to proceed with the EPCA until the parties closed the PSA, which would not occur unless the Project developed according to their expectations.</p>
<p id="03984bdd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The PSA included various conditions precedent that each party had to satisfy prior to the “Long–Stop Date” set for March 31, 2011. According to enXco, the Long–Stop Date was not a point of contention during contract negotiations. In fact, enXco selected the actual date without argument from NSP. enXco contends that “[t]he purpose of a long-stop date is to serve as a milestone against which to measure whether a project is ‘buildable’ . . . and such dates are regularly extended.” In fact, in two of the parties’ previous wind-farm projects, the parties agreed to modify their contracts to postpone the applicable long-stop date.</p>
<p id="03984bde-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The PSA also provided that “[t]he obligation of [NSP] to consummate the transactions contemplated by this [PSA] shall be subject to fulfillment at or prior to the Closing of each of the following conditions.” One condition precedent required enXco to obtain a Certificate of Site Compatibility (CSC). The CSC is a permit that the North Dakota Public Service Commission (NDPSC) issues that must be obtained before the parties could begin construction on the Project. <i>See</i> N.D. Cent. Code §49–22–02. The PSA also included a provision that stated “that in no event shall the Closing occur later than the Long–Stop Date.” It also included the following termination clause:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03984bdf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Agreement may be terminated prior to the Closing: (i) by either [NSP], on the one side, or [enXco], on the other side, upon written notice to the other <span title="807" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-807">p. 807</span>Party of such termination, in the event the Closing has not occurred or the conditions precedent to Closing in favor of the terminating Party have not been fulfilled or waived on or before the Long–Stop Date. . . . </p>
</div>
<p id="03984be0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It also provided that termination could occur without any liability accruing to the terminating party. Finally, the EPCA provided that the parties could terminate the EPCA should they fail to close the PSA.</p>
<p id="03984be1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">enXco had approximately 29 months after the execution of the contracts until the Long–Stop Date to obtain the CSC. Under North Dakota law, a party must submit a letter to the NDPSC, stating that it intends to construct an energy conversion facility. <i>See</i> N.D. Admin. Code 69–06–03–01. After an applicant like NSP submits this letter, it must wait one year before submitting its CSC application. <i>See</i> N.D. Admin. Code 69–06–03–01 (2011) (amended in 2013 to omit the one-year wait period). enXco requested and received from the NDPSC a waiver of the one-year requirement in January 2009; thus, enXco could have submitted its application as early as January 2009.</p>
<p id="03984be2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A CSC application must demonstrate that the project would have a limited impact on endangered species. <i>See</i> N.D. Cent. Code §49–22–09(10). Unfortunately for enXco, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) warned enXco that the Project could have a deleterious effect on two species of birds because of the proposed physical locations of the wind turbines. Chris Sternhagen, enXco’s Project Development Manager, testified that this problem delayed its submission of the CSC application. He would later testify, however, that the turbine layout actually “played very little impact as to the schedule.”</p>
<p id="03984be3-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In any event, almost two years expired before enXco submitted the CSC application in October 2010. Thus, enXco had less than six months to obtain the CSC by the Long–Stop Date. North Dakota law, however, allowed the NDPSC to consider the completed CSC application for up to six months after its receipt. <i>See</i> N.D. Cent. Code §49–22–08(5). Nonetheless, Sternhagen testified that a NDPSC staff member informed him that a decision would be reached in two-to-four months.</p>
<p id="03984be4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The NDPSC scheduled a statutorily mandated public hearing on the permit for December 21, 2010. Unfortunately, the hearing was postponed due to a snowstorm. The NDPSC conducted the hearing on February 10, 2011, but on March 17, 2011, the NDPSC discovered that the hearing occurred in the wrong county contrary to North Dakota law. <i>See</i> N.D. Cent. Code §49–22–13(1). As a result, a new hearing had to be scheduled, but North Dakota law also required a 20–day public notice. <i>See</i> N.D. Cent. Code §49–22–13(4). Thus, the hearing was not rescheduled to occur until after the Long–Stop Date. enXco petitioned the NDPSC to waive the 20–day notice requirement. In support of this petition, Sternhagen informed the NDPSC that, unless the NDPSC waived the 20–day requirement, “NSP can terminate the [PSA] between the parties, effectively terminating this Project.” At the resulting NDPSC meeting on the petition, enXco’s counsel informed the NDPSC that “NSP would have the contractual ability to terminate April 1 and there’s nothing that we can do as enXco to prevent that” if enXco did not obtain the CSC prior to the Long–Stop Date. The NDPSC denied <span title="808" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-808">p. 808</span>the petition. On April 1, 2011, NSP terminated the PSA and thus the EPCA as well after the Long–Stop Date passed. enXco nonetheless obtained the CSC on June 8, 2011.</p>
<p id="039872f5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From execution of the contracts in October 2008 until their termination in April 2011, wind-energy-generation profit prospects declined such that NSP stood to lose significant amounts of money should it proceed with the Project. Apparently the market for wind turbines dried up significantly during this time. As a result, NSP had the economic incentive to avoid the contract—a fact that enXco emphasizes. Because the particular wind turbines that enXco purchased were already outdated, enXco could not resell them on the secondary market. Therefore, enXco redeployed them for use in a different project in Texas.</p>
<p id="039872f6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">enXco purchased the turbines for $216 million. Experts testified that the turbines’ post-termination value was between $83.3 million and $123 million, minus the $10 million cost enXco incurred to relocate them. Thus, the turbines diminished in value between $93 million and $141 million. enXco’s valuation expert determined that the value of the Project’s assets like real estate and permits totaled $0 because of the lack of market for the Project and the $15 million cost in maintaining the assets. However, enXco representatives testified that enXco still hoped the Project site would eventually be profitable.</p>
<p id="039872f7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">enXco sued NSP on May 4, 2011, in response to a declaratory judgment action that NSP filed based on its termination of the contracts. The district court consolidated the cases, staying NSP’s declaratory-judgment action pending the resolution of enXco’s suit. enXco sued for declaratory relief and damages for breach of contract. The parties agreed, and the district court concluded, that Minnesota law applied to their contracts.</p>
<p id="039872f8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">enXco argued that the doctrines of temporary impracticability and disproportionate forfeiture should apply to prevent strict enforcement of the condition precedent. The district court granted NSP’s motion for summary judgment. The district court determined that NSP did not breach the contracts. The district court concluded that the conditions precedent and termination clause expressly permitted NSP to terminate the contracts if enXco failed to satisfy any condition precedent. Furthermore, the district court found that the parties were sophisticated and reached agreement after substantial arms-length negotiation. Thus, according to the district court, enXco should have appreciated the risk that it assumed in the event that it failed to obtain the required permit. The district court declined to apply the doctrine of temporary impracticability to a condition precedent. Additionally, it found that enXco could not demonstrate that it suffered a disproportionate forfeiture because it kept all of the real estate and assets associated with the project and bestowed nothing to NSP. Finally, the district court determined that it need not consider the materiality of conditions precedent as it would typical contract terms. enXco appeals, seeking reversal of the district court’s grant of summary judgment to NSP.</p>

Furthermore, enXco does not dispute that in so doing it failed to satisfy a condition precedent rather than an ordinary contract term. enXco agrees that if we strictly construe the condition precedent, then NSP had the contractual right to terminate the contracts. However, enXco contends that we should excuse its failure to obtain the CSC by the Long–Stop Date based upon the legal doctrines of temporary impracticability and disproportionate forfeiture.</p>
<p id="039872fc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b>A. Temporary Impracticability</b></p>
<p id="039872fd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">enXco contends that the doctrine of temporary impracticability should excuse its failure to satisfy the condition precedent that it obtain the CSC by the Long–Stop Date. More specifically, enXco argues that it was impracticable for it to obtain the CSC by the Long–Stop Date because of delays from a snowstorm, a hearing location error, and state law notice requirements. enXco contends that “inclement weather and regulatory error,” which delayed the NDPSC’s processing of enXco’s CSC application for five months, made it “impracticable to obtain the CSC.” As a result of this alleged impracticability, enXco was excused from fulfilling the condition precedent, rendering NSP’s termination of the PSA and EPCA a breach of contract. Additionally, enXco argues that Minnesota law recognizes the doctrine of temporary impracticability as applied to conditions precedent in a contract. Finally, enXco argues that Minnesota law allows plaintiffs to use the doctrine of temporary impracticability as a sword or offensive legal mechanism to pursue breach-of-contract claims in addition to defendants’ use of the doctrine as a shield or defense against such actions.</p>
<p id="039872fe-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The doctrine of impracticability applies:</p>

<p id="03987302-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Restatement (Second) of Contracts §269. The Restatement further provides for application of the doctrine of temporary impracticability to situations where a promisor violates a condition precedent, stating, “Impracticability excuses the non-occurrence of a condition if the occurrence of the condition is not a material part of the agreed exchange and forfeiture would otherwise result.” Restatement (Second) of Contracts §271.</p>
<p id="03987303-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Assuming, without deciding, that Minnesota courts would apply the doctrine of temporary impracticability to conditions precedent for use as a sword, we conclude that the doctrine has no application on these facts. enXco argues that the several delays in holding a proper public hearing produced temporary impracticability. However, enXco waited approximately two years before applying for the CSC. enXco could have applied as early as January 2009, yet it waited until October 2010. enXco submitted its application less than six months before the Long–Stop Date, and North Dakota law expressly authorizes the NDPSC to consider the application for up to six months. See N.D. Cent. Code §49–22–08(5). The PSA’s time table contemplated and assumed that the NDPSC process could be lengthy and not entirely predictable.</p>
<p id="03987304-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The various sources of delay were all foreseeable and manageable in the time frame agreed to in the contracts. Although problems surfaced related to endangered birds, enXco likely could have pursued some type of accommodation with the USFWS or NDPSC in order to ensure a timely submission of its application. Or, it could have insisted on a later Long–Stop Date, especially since the actual date was not a point of contention between the parties. enXco could have also negotiated for a more flexible Long–Stop Date (e.g., “The Long–Stop Date shall be no earlier than one year after enXco submits its application for a CSC.”). See Vill. Of Minn. v. Fairbanks, Morse &amp; Co., 226 Minn. 1, 31 N.W.2d 920, 926 (1948) (“A man may contract to do what is impossible, as well as what is difficult, and be liable for failure to perform.”). In sum, enXco, by exercise of appropriate diligence within the terms of the agreement, could likely have avoided the circumstances that caused it to fail a condition precedent.</p>

The PSA language regarding the satisfaction of conditions precedent and the termination clause expressly say so. The parties foresaw the risk of regulatory and weather delays and accounted for them. Although they could not foresee the specific circumstances that led to the non-occurrence of the condition, it is clear that the parties anticipated that the CSC might not be obtained in time. Furthermore, the doctrine of temporary impracticability does not apply when the government fails to issue a permit in a timely manner, especially where the parties recognized this possibility.

<p id="03989a1b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">enXco argues that it suffered a disproportionate forfeiture. enXco experienced an approximately $100 million diminution in value of its properties. On the other hand, NSP suffered no meaningful harm from enXco’s tardy CSC. enXco further argues that Minnesota courts recognize that the doctrine of disproportionate forfeiture applies to the non-fulfillment of a condition precedent as well as for use as a sword rather than a shield. The district court determined that enXco did not suffer a disproportionate forfeiture because it retained title to all of the real estate and assets involved in the Project. enXco never transferred any of this property to NSP.</p>

We reach this conclusion despite the alleged materiality of the condition precedent at issue. The Restatement notes that a “forfeiture” “refer[s] to the denial of compensation that results when the obligee loses his right to the agreed exchange after he has relied substantially, as by preparation or performance on the expectation of that exchange.” Restatement (Second) of Contracts §229 cmt. b.

It still maintained possession and ownership of the Project assets and real estate. enXco transferred the Project’s physical capital for use in other projects, and it hopes to employ the real property associated with the Project in the future. NSP did not obtain ownership of any property as a result of termination. NSP therefore did not receive something for little or nothing. <i>Cf.</i> Hideaway, Inc. v.

<li class=""><p id="0398c138-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Language sufficient to create an express condition.</i> The <i>enXco</i> court stated briefly at the beginning of its legal discussion that enXco conceded that it “failed to satisfy a condition precedent rather than an ordinary contract term” and that “strict” enforcement would mean that the defendant was entitled to terminate the contract. Thus, the court’s opinion focused primarily on enXco’s arguments for “excuse” from the express condition rather than whether such a condition existed. It should be noted, however, that in many cases involving an express condition as a defense to liability for nonperformance, a threshold and fiercely debated issue will be whether the duty in question was indeed so conditioned. The Restatement (Second) §224 defines a condition as “an event, not certain to occur, which must occur . . . before performance under a contract becomes due.” Courts are typically emphatic that an “express condition” must be stated in unambiguous language because express conditions must be literally performed or satisfied; substantial performance will not suffice. See, e.g., MHR Capital Partners LP v. Presstek, Inc. 912 N.E.2d 43 (N.Y. 2009) (noting that courts have recognized that the use of terms such as “if,” “unless,” and “until” constitutes “unmistakable language of condition”).</p>
<p id="0398c139-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In making the determination whether a term is an express condition, it is important to note that the Restatement (Second) §227 prefers an interpretation that a term or event is not an express condition in order to reduce the risk of forfeiture. In Solar Applications Eng’g, Inc. v. T.A. Operating Corp., 327 S.W.3d 104 (Tex. 2010), the court relied heavily on that interpretive preference in concluding that a “lien-release affidavit” required before final payment to the builder in a construction project was only a promise and not an express condition. The court noted that whether a term is an express condition depends on the intent of the parties, but such a finding requires clear, unambiguous language. An express condition will not be found if there is another reasonable interpretation. Thus, the contractor could satisfy its obligation to deliver a lien-free property through other means and still be entitled to the final payment. Id. at 112-113. See also Lokan &amp; Associates, Inc. v. American Beef, 311 P.3d 1285 (Wash. Ct. App. 2013) (doubtful language concerning receipt of federal funding by client would not be construed as an express condition to recruiter’s right to payment).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0398c13a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Strict enforcement of express conditions.</i> Once the court has determined that the contract term in question really does expressly condition the obligor’s duty of performance on the occurrence of some event, what will be the effect <span title="814" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-814">p. 814</span>of its nonoccurrence? Until the conditioning event does occur, the duty does not arise; at the point when it cannot (or for some reason clearly will not) occur, the obligor is discharged from its performance obligations under the contract. Restatement (Second) §225. Although the “strict enforcement” approach to express conditions may be characteristic of classical contract law, it is alive and well today, as the <i>enXco</i> opinion demonstrates. Another example of the rule is found in Maxton Builders v. Lo Galbo, 502 N.E.2d 184 (N.Y. 1986) in which the buyers entered into a real estate contract that included a handwritten term providing that they could cancel the contract “upon written notice to the seller within three days” if the real estate taxes were determined to exceed $3,500. Upon discovering the next day that the taxes exceeded the stated amount, the buyers’ attorney telephoned the seller’s counsel and informed him that the contact was being cancelled. The buyers’ attorney also sent a certified letter giving notice on the second day following contract formation but it was not received until the sixth day. The court held that it was “settled law” that a written notice required by a contract would be ineffective unless actually received within the stated time. Id. at 186. (You might be interested to know that the attorney in <i>Maxton</i> who failed to give the requisite written notice of cancellation on behalf of his clients was later held to have thereby committed actionable malpractice as a matter of law, despite assertions that he relied on the other attorney’s assurances that oral notice was sufficient. Lo Galbo v. Plishkin, Rubano &amp; Baum, 558 N.Y.S.2d 185 (App. Div. 1990).)</p>
<p id="0398c13b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Restatement (Second) endorses the general rule of strict enforcement of express conditions and Comment <i>d</i> to §237 rejects the application of a “substantial performance” qualification to that rule. See also Sun Valley, Ltd. v. Galyan’s Trading Co., LLC, 2014 WL 1030956 (E.D. Mich.) (express condition in lease requiring a “Sears Great Indoors” store as anchor tenant in mall could not be satisfied by “Sears outlet store”; substantial performance rule does not apply to essential contract term).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0398c13c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Distinction between express conditions and promises.</i> As suggested by the preceding notes, one issue of interpretation that frequently arises concerning contract terms involves the distinction between a condition and a promise. The difference is critically important because while an express condition requires strict compliance, a promise generally requires only “substantial performance,” a concept explored in more detail in the Jacob &amp; Youngs, Inc. v. Kent case in the following section of this chapter. If a condition fails, the obligor is discharged from further obligations under the contract. On the other hand, the breach of a promise does not necessarily discharge the obligor and may only give rise to a claim for damages for breach of the promise. As analyzed by the <i>enXco</i> court, the plaintiff’s failure to acquire the permit by the stated date amounted to failure of a condition, releasing the defendant from any duty to proceed with the transactions. Could the term requiring the permit also be interpreted as a promise by the plaintiff to make timely application with the state agencies, the breach of which would give rise to a cause of action against enXco for breach of contract? It is clear that NSP was delighted to simply have the contracts discharged because they had become financially <span title="815" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-815">p. 815</span>disadvantageous, but suppose the contract had been profitable to NSP, could NSP have held enXco liable for damages because of the unreasonable delay in seeking the permits?</p>
<p id="0398c13d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However one interprets the provision in <i>enXco,</i> there is no principled reason why a contractual term cannot be interpreted as <i>both</i> a promise and an express condition. See, e.g., Weber v. North Loup River Public Power and Irrigation Dist., 854 N.W.2d 263 (Neb. 2014) (farmer’s obligation to pay annual fees to irrigation district was both a promise and an express condition precedent to district’s obligation to deliver water in succeeding irrigation season). If an event is a “promissory condition,” failure of the event to occur justifies the obligor in treating her obligations as discharged, and also subjects the obligee to liability for damages.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0398c13e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>“Pay-when-paid” clauses</i>. The preceding discussion indicates that a contract term might be interpreted by a court as either an express condition or as a promise, or possibly as both. Yet another possibility is that a term that defines a performance obligation by reference to the happening of some event may be <i>neither</i> a promise nor a condition. Thus, in cases where the language of the contract in some fashion links a subcontractor’s right to payment for work performed to the general contractor’s receipt of payment from the owner (sometimes referred to as a “pay-when-paid” clause), the majority of courts have preferred to interpret such language as merely calling for payment within a reasonable time, and not as also conditioning the subcontractor’s right to payment on such prior receipt of payment by the general contractor. To rule otherwise, the courts have pointed out, would require the subcontractor to assume the risk of the owner’s credit, with the accompanying possibility of forfeiture. To achieve that result, strong language will be needed (and even then may not be effective). See Superior Steel, Inc. v. Ascent at Roebling’s Bridge, Inc., 540 S.W.3d 770 (Ky. 2018) (acknowledging that a “pay-when-paid” clause will usually be interpreted as mere timing mechanism and not as a term placing risk of nonpayment on subcontractor, but explicit “pay-<i>if</i>-paid” clause in construction subcontract would be given effect as express condition precedent under principle of freedom of contract). Some states regulate such clauses by statutes, which generally protect the subcontractor in varying degrees. See generally Margie Alsbrook, Contracting Away an Honest Day’s Pay: An Examination of Conditional Payment Clauses in Construction Contracts, 58 Ark. L. Rev. 353 (2005).</p>
<p id="0398c13f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are a variety of other situations in which a duty to make payment is expressly conditioned on the happening of some event or the receipt of some funding by the obligor. See, e.g., P &amp; E Properties, Inc. v. United Natural Foods, Inc., 713 F. Supp. 2d 262 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (right of provider of administrative services to receive reimbursement from client for “extraordinary expenses” was expressly conditioned on prior written approval of such expenditures by client); Ferguson Advisors, LLC v. Malherbe, 274 P.3d 839 (Okla. Civ. App. 2011) (realtor who agreed to delay portion of broker’s fee otherwise due at closing until buyer paid deferred portion of purchase price assumed risk that payment by buyer would not be made).<span title="816" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-816">p. 816</span></p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0398c140-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Conditions precedent and subsequent.</i> The <i>enXco</i> court classifies the requirement of the permit as a “condition precedent.” The phrasing intimates a distinction that courts traditionally made between conditions <i>precedent</i> and conditions <i>subsequent.</i> A condition precedent refers to an event that must exist or occur <i>before</i> a duty to perform will arise. A condition subsequent contemplates that a duty would be owed but subject to discharge on the happening of an event <i>after</i> that duty had originally arisen. See Joseph M. Perillo, Contracts §11.5, §11.7 (7th ed. 2014). If <i>enXco</i> illustrates a condition precedent, an example of a condition subsequent, in effect, is found in Jenkins v. Eckerd Corp., 913 So. 2d 43 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2005), in which the tenant drug store had a long-term lease in a shopping center that allowed the tenant to terminate on 90-day notice if the anchor supermarket ever ceased operations. After operating for almost 20 years, the supermarket closed as part of bankruptcy proceedings and the tenant was allowed to terminate. The more modern view, however, reflected in the Restatement (Second) §224, Comment <i>e,</i> is that the distinction between conditions precedent and subsequent is unhelpful and should not be generally recognized. See also Gingras v. Avery, 878 A.2d 404, 408 n.4 (Conn. App. Ct. 2005) (modern view is that condition precedent versus subsequent distinction obscures more than it clarifies and results in confusion).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0398c141-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Excuses due to impracticability and similar contract defenses.</i> Much of the <i>enXco</i> opinion is focused on the plaintiff’s arguments for excusing the nonoccurrence of the express condition and enforcing the contract against the defendant notwithstanding the fact that the permit was not obtained by the deadline. The court indicated a general receptiveness to the theory that the impracticability doctrine might serve to excuse nonoccurrence of an express condition. The plaintiff needed to establish, however, that the elements of an impracticability defense were met. (Recall the discussion of impracticability in the <i>Hemlock</i> case in Chapter 8.) The <i>enXco</i> court found the plaintiff’s impracticability claim lacking in at least two respects: The nonoccurrence was largely the fault of enXco and the contract assigned to enXco the risk that governmental approval might not be granted by the deadline. Note that a party might also seek to excuse an express condition based on other grounds for refusing enforcement to a term, such as inconsistency with public policy, unconscionability or mistake, if the elements of those doctrines can be shown. See generally Joseph M. Perillo, Contracts §11.36 (7th ed. 2014).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0398c142-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Excuse to avoid disproportionate forfeiture</i>. The <i>enXco</i> court considered at length the possibility that the contract might be enforced, despite the failure of express condition, to avoid forfeiture. Even though enXco allegedly lost more than $100 million due to a decrease in value of the real property and other assets, the court identified a number of reasons to reject enXco’s claim of disproportionate forfeiture — enXco still owned the property and assets and it did not transfer anything to NSP, the contract was negotiated by sophisticated parties with the assistance of counsel, the bargain expressly allowed for termination by NSP under the circumstances, and NSP did not obtain valuable property from enXco for little or nothing. Thus, the court left the parties to their bargain. The possibility of excuse due to forfeiture is also advanced, with <span title="817" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-817">p. 817</span>more success, by the plaintiff in J. N. A. Realty Corp. v. Cross Bay Chelsea Inc., the next case in these materials. We will further address the forfeiture theory in the notes following the <i>JNA</i> case.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0398c143-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Excuse due to immateriality.</i> In recounting the trial court decision, the appellate court in <i>enXco</i> briefly mentions that the lower court had declined to consider an argument that the condition should be excused because it was not a material term of the contract. In fact, the trial court considered the argument at length before concluding that under the traditional requirement of strict compliance with express conditions, materiality is not a factor. See enXco Dev. Corp. v. Northern States Power Co., 2013 WL 1364242 (D. Minn.). The argument that immateriality should be a recognized excuse was forcefully made in an article by Professor Robert Childres, Conditions in the Law of Contracts, 45 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 33 (1970). After examining scores of decisions citing the conditions provisions of the first Restatement, Childres concluded that almost all modern courts (as of 1970, that is) would actually insist on strict performance of conditions only when the conditioning events are material to the agreement of the parties. Conditions that are merely “technical” he found to be generally excused under various theories such as adverse interpretation, waiver, prevention, or avoidance of forfeiture. Professor Childres recommended that courts abandon these theories in favor of a broader rule: Only material conditions should be strictly enforced. At least some courts appear to share Professor Childres’s belief that the issue of materiality should be relevant to the question of how strictly a condition should be enforced. See, e.g, Sahadi v. Continental Illinois Nat’l Bank &amp; Trust Co., 706 F.2d 193, 198 n.2 (7th Cir. 1983) (slight delay in making interest payments would not trigger failure of condition, accelerating payment of entire debt obligation; earlier precedents to the contrary were “decided in the salad days of American legal formalism which were marked by an unprecedented adherence to the letter of contractual text — a jurisprudential posture that has since been eclipsed by the kind of materiality approach embodied in [later Illinois cases]”). Adopting <i>arguendo</i> Professor Childres’s approach, does it appear to you that the condition involved in the <i>enXco</i> case was material?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0398c144-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Waiver and estoppel of condition.</i> An obligor whose duty is expressly dependent on a condition may be under a duty to perform despite the nonoccurrence of that condition, if a court finds that he has, by word or conduct, “waived” the right to insist on fulfillment of the condition before performing the duty. Restatement (Second) §84(1) expresses the concept of waiver (the term itself is not used in the section, but see Comment <i>b</i>). As usually defined, waiver is “an intentional relinquishment of a known right.” As expressed in §84(1), a waiver is effective without either consideration or reliance, but only if the condition waived was not either a material part of the performance that the obligor was to receive in exchange or a material part of the risk assumed. Compare Savre v. Santoyo, 865 N.W.2d 419 (N.D. 2015) (affirming trial court conclusion that landlord waived express condition in lease-to-purchase option that required monthly lease payments for property to be made on time), with Fitzpatrick v. American Intern. Group, Inc., 2013 WL 709048 (S.D.N.Y.) (rejecting waiver <span title="818" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-818">p. 818</span>claim related to express condition requiring former employee to give notice of alleged breach by employer within 30 days of occurrence to be entitled to future profits; waiver will not be lightly inferred and continuing discussions with employee did not amount to intentional waiver by employer).</p>
<p id="0398e855-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the condition in <i>enXco</i> was merely minor — “procedural or technical” — it could be waived by the defendant-obligor’s expression of intention to do so. If it were not minor, but material, it could still be overcome by an estoppel, based on the obligor’s expression of intention not to insist on it, followed by the plaintiff-obligee’s prejudicial reliance on that manifestation of intention. Note that the courts are not always precise in categorizing the type of excuse being recognized. See, e.g., In re Transact, Inc., 2014 WL 3888230 (C.D. Cal.) (lender “waived” express condition that contractor be “in good standing in California and Nevada” by disbursing first two draws of funds, knowing that condition was not satisfied; contractor relied to its substantial detriment on continued funding by incurring construction expenses).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0398e856-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Prevention of condition.</i> Another potential basis for excuse is the doctrine of “prevention,” which states that a condition is excused if the promisor wrongfully hinders or prevents the condition from occurring. E.g., United Partition Systems, Inc. v. United States, 90 Fed. Cl. 74 (2009) (stating that federal government like any other contracting party has an implied duty not to prevent or delay performance by the other party). See Restatement (Second) §245. Where the conditioning event is to some extent within the obligor’s control, the obligor is likely to have at least the obligation to attempt to cause the condition to occur. E.g., Stendig, Inc. v. Thom Rock Realty Co., 558 N.Y.S.2d 917 (App. Div. 1990) (where both parties’ obligations under lease of showroom space in design center were conditioned on landlord’s having rented minimum amount of square feet of space, landlord subject to implied duty to use “good faith best efforts” to obtain tenants, citing Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon). Even if the event is not within the obligor’s control, she may be under an obligation (express or implied) to cooperate with the obligee in causing the condition to happen, or at the minimum not to impede those efforts. E.g., Fateh v. Rich, 481 A.2d 464 (D.C. 1984) (defendant buyers of restaurant business wrongfully prevented condition that liquor authority give its consent to transfer of liquor license by engaging person with criminal record as manager of restaurant business, in violation of liquor authority policy). The question is often a difficult one, however, and courts have frequently held that the possibility of prevention of the condition by the obligor was a risk assumed by the obligee, and thus not “wrongful.”</p></li>

<p id="0398e85d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">J. N. A. Realty Corp., the owner of a building in Howard Beach, commenced this proceeding to recover possession of the premises claiming that the lease <span title="819" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-819">p. 819</span>has expired. The lease grants the tenant, Cross Bay Chelsea, Inc., an option to renew and although the notice was sent, through negligence or inadvertence, it was not sent within the time prescribed in the lease. The landlord seeks to enforce the letter of the agreement. The tenant asks for equity to relieve it from a forfeiture.</p>
<p id="0398e85e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Civil Court, after a trial, held that the tenant was entitled to equitable relief. The Appellate Term affirmed, without opinion, but the Appellate Division, after granting leave, reversed and granted the petition. The tenant has appealed to this court.</p>
<p id="0398e85f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two primary questions are raised on the appeal. First, will the tenant suffer a forfeiture if the landlord is permitted to enforce the letter of the agreement. Secondly, if there will be a forfeiture, may a court of equity grant the tenant relief when the forfeiture would result from the tenant’s own neglect or inadvertence.</p>
<p id="0398e860-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the trial it was shown that J. N. A. Realty Corp. (hereafter JNA) originally leased the premises to Victor Palermo and Sylvester Vascellero for a 10-year term commencing on January 1, 1964. Paragraph 58 of the lease, which was attached as part of 12-page rider, granted the tenants an option to renew for a 10-year term provided “that Tenant shall notify the landlord in writing by registered or certified mail six (6) months prior to the last day of the term of the lease that tenant desires such renewal.” The tenants opened a restaurant on the premises. In February, 1964 they formed the Foro Romano Corp. (Foro) and assigned the lease to the corporation.</p>
<p id="0398e861-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By December of 1967 the restaurant was operating at a loss and Foro decided to close it down and offer it for sale or lease. In March, 1968 Foro entered into a contract with Cross Bay Chelsea, Inc. (hereafter Chelsea), to sell the restaurant and assign the lease. As a condition of the sale Foro was required to obtain a modification of the option to renew so that Chelsea would have the right to renew the lease for an additional term of 24 years.</p>
<p id="0398e862-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The closing took place in June of 1968. First JNA modified the option and consented to the assignment. The modification, which consists of a separate document to be attached to the lease, states: “the Tenant shall have a right to renew this lease for a further period of Twenty-Four (24) years, instead of Ten (10) years, from the expiration of the original term of said lease. . . . All other provisions of Paragraph #58 in said lease, . . . shall remain in full force and effect, except as hereinabove modified.” Foro then assigned the lease and sold its interest in the restaurant to Chelsea for $155,000. The bill of sale states that “the value of the fixtures and chattels included in this sale is the sum of $40,000 and that the remainder of the purchase price is the value of the leasehold and possession of the restaurant premises.” At that point five and one-half years remained on the original term of the lease.</p>
<p id="0398e863-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the summer of 1968 Chelsea reopened the restaurant. JNA’s president, Nicholas Arena, admitted on the stand that throughout the tenancy it regularly informed Chelsea in writing of its obligations under the lease, such as the need to pay taxes and insurance by certain dates. For instance on June 13, 1973 JNA sent a letter to Chelsea informing them that certain taxes were due to be paid. When that letter was sent the option to renew was due to expire in <span title="820" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-820">p. 820</span>approximately two weeks but JNA made no mention of this. A similar letter was sent to Chelsea in September, 1973.</p>
<p id="0398e864-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Arena also admitted that throughout the term of the tenancy he was “most assuredly” aware of the time limitation on the option. In fact there is some indication in the record that JNA had previously used this device in an attempt to evict another tenant. Nevertheless it was not until November 12, 1973 that JNA took any action to inform the tenant that the option had lapsed. Then it sent a letter noting that the date had passed and, the letter states, “not having heard from you as prescribed by paragraph #58 in our lease we must assume you will vacate the premises” at the expiration of the original term, January 1, 1974. By letter dated November 16, 1973 Chelsea, through its attorney, sent written notice of intention to renew the option which, of course, JNA refused to honor.</p>
<p id="0398e865-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the trial Chelsea’s principals claimed that they were not aware of the time limitation because they had never received a copy of paragraph 58 of the rider. They had received a copy of the modification but they had assumed that it gave them an absolute right to retain the tenancy for 24 years after the expiration of the original term. However, at the trial and later at the Appellate Division, it was found that Chelsea had knowledge of, or at least was “chargeable with notice” of, the time limitation in the rider and thus was negligent in failing to renew within the time prescribed.</p>
<p id="0398e866-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chelsea’s principals also testified that they had spent an additional $15,000 on improvements, at least part of which had been expended after the option had expired. Toward the end of the trial JNA’s attorney asked the court whether it would “take evidence from” Arena that he had negotiated with another tenant after the option to renew had lapsed. However, the court held that this testimony would be immaterial.</p>
<p id="03990f77-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is a settled principle of law that a notice exercising an option is ineffective if it is not given within the time specified (see, e.g., Restatement, Contracts 2d [Tent. Draft No. 1, 1964], §64, subd. [b]; 1A Corbin, Contracts [1963], §264; 1 Williston, Contracts [3d ed. 1957], §87; Sy Jack Realty Co. v. Pergament Syosset Corp., 27 N.Y.2d 449, 318 N.Y.S.2d 720, 267 N.E.2d 462). “At law, of course, time is always of the essence of the contract” (De Funiak, Modern Equity, §80, p. 223). Thus the tenant had no legal right to exercise the option when it did, but to say that is simply to pose the issue; it does not resolve it. Of course the tenant would not be asking for equitable relief if it could establish its rights at law.</p>
<p id="03990f78-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The major obstacle to obtaining equitable relief in these cases is that default on an option usually does not result in a forfeiture. The reason is that the option itself does not create any interest in the property, and no rights accrue until the condition precedent has been met by giving notice within the time specified. Thus equity will not intervene because the loss of the option does not ordinarily result in the forfeiture of any vested rights. . . . It has been suggested that even when the option has been paid for, nothing is forfeited when it expires, because the amount paid “is the exact agreed equivalent” of the power to exercise the right for the time allotted (see 1 Corbin, Contracts, §35, p. 147).</p>
<p id="03990f79-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="821" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-821">p. 821</span>But when a tenant in possession under an existing lease has neglected to exercise an option to renew, he might suffer a forfeiture if he has made valuable improvements on the property. This of course generally distinguishes the lease option, to renew or purchase, from the stock option or the option to buy goods. This was a distinction which some of the older cases failed to recognize. . . . More recently it has been noted that “although the tenant has no legal interest in the renewal period until the required notice is given, yet an equitable interest is recognized and protected against forfeiture in some cases where the tenant has in good faith made improvements of a substantial character, intending to renew the lease, if the landlord is not harmed by the delay in the giving of the notice and the lessee would sustain substantial loss in case the lease were not renewed” (2 Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence [5th ed.], §453b, p. 296).</p>
<p id="03990f7a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The leading case on this point is Fountain Co. v. Stein, 97 Conn. 619, 118 A. 47, 27 A.L.R. 976 and the rule has been accepted by noted commentators (see, e.g., 1 Corbin, op. cit., §35, p. 146; 1 Williston, Contracts [3d ed.], §76, p. 249, n.4; 2 Pomeroy, op. cit., §453b, p. 296). It has also been accepted and applied by this court. In Jones v. Gianferante, 305 N.Y. 135, 138, 111 N.E.2d 419, 420, citing the <i>Fountain</i> case we held that the tenant was entitled to “the benefit of the rule or practice in equity which relieves against such forfeitures of valuable lease terms when default in notice has not prejudiced the landlord, and has resulted from an honest mistake, or similar excusable fault.” The rule was extended in Sy Jack Realty Co. v. Pergament Syosset Corp., 27 N.Y.2d 449, 453, 318 N.Y.S.2d 720, 722, 267 N.E.2d 462, 464, supra to preserve the tenant’s interest in a “long-standing location for a retail business” because this is “an important part of the good will of that enterprise, [and thus] the tenant stands to lose a substantial and valuable asset.”</p>
<p id="03990f7b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In neither of those cases were we asked to consider whether the tenant would be entitled to equitable relief from the consequences of his own neglect or “mere forgetfulness” as the court had held in the <i>Fountain</i> case, supra. In <i>Gianferante</i> the default was due to an ambiguous lease, and in <i>Sy Jack</i> the notice was mailed but never delivered. . . . But the principle involved is well established in this State. A tenant or mortgagor should not be denied equitable relief from the consequences of his own neglect or inadvertence if a forfeiture would result (Giles v. Austin, 62 N.Y. 486; Noyes v. Anderson, 124 N.Y. 175, 26 N.E. 316. . . .) The rule applies even though the tenant or mortgagor, by his inadvertence, has neglected to perform an affirmative duty and thus breached a covenant in the agreement (Giles v. Austin, supra; Noyes v. Anderson, supra).</p>
<p id="03990f7c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On occasion the court has cautioned that equitable relief would be denied where there has been a willful or gross neglect (Noyes v. Anderson, supra, 124 N.Y. p. 179, 26 N.E. p. 317), but it has been reluctant to employ the sanction when a forfeiture would result. In Giles v. Austin, supra, p. 491, for instance, the landlord sought to recover possession of the premises after the tenant had neglected to pay the taxes as required by a covenant in the lease. We held that although the tenant had not paid the taxes since the inception of the lease in 1859, and had only paid them after suit was commenced in 1868, the tenant’s <span title="822" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-822">p. 822</span>default was not “so willful, or his neglect so inexcusable, that a court of equity should have denied him any relief.”</p>
<p id="03990f7d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are several cases in which this court has denied a tenant or mortgagor equitable relief because of his own neglect to perform within the time fixed in the lease or mortgage, but only when it has found that there was “no penalty, no forfeiture” (Graf v. Hope Bldg. Corp., 254 N.Y. 1, 4, 171 N.E. 884, 885 . . .). Cardozo took a different view. He felt that even though there may be no penalty or forfeiture “in a strict or proper sense” equity should “relieve against it if default has been due to mere venial inattention and if relief can be granted without damage to the lender.” Even in those cases he would apply the general equitable principle that “the gravity of the fault must be compared with the gravity of the hardship” (Graf v. Hope Bldg. Corp., supra, 254 N.Y. pp. 9-10, 13, 171 N.E. p. 888 [Cardozo, Ch. J., dissenting]; see, also, 2 Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence [5th ed.], §439, p. 220).</p>
<p id="03990f7e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, as noted, the tenant has made a considerable investment in improvements on the premises — $40,000 at the time of purchase, and an additional $15,000 during the tenancy. In addition, if the location is lost, the restaurant would undoubtedly lose a considerable amount of its customer good will. The tenant was at fault, but not in a culpable sense. It was, as Cardozo says, “mere venial inattention.” There would be a forfeiture and the gravity of the loss is certainly out of all proportion to the gravity of the fault. Thus, under the circumstances of this case, the tenant would be entitled to equitable relief if there is no prejudice to the landlord.</p>
<p id="03990f7f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, it is not clear from the record whether JNA would be prejudiced if the tenant is relieved of its default. Because of the trial court’s ruling, JNA was unable to submit proof that it might be prejudiced if the terms of the agreement were not enforced literally. Its proof of other negotiations was considered immaterial. It may be that after the tenant’s default the landlord, relying on the agreement, in good faith, made other commitments for the premises. But if JNA did not rely on the letter of the agreement then, it should not be permitted to rely on it now to exact a substantial forfeiture for the tenant’s unwitting default. This, however, must be resolved at a new trial.</p>
<p id="03990f80-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally we would note, as the dissenters do, that it is possible to imagine a situation in which a tenant holding an option to renew might intentionally delay beyond the time prescribed in order to exploit a fluctuating market. However, as the dissenters also note, there is no evidence to suggest that that is what occurred here. On the contrary there has been an affirmed finding of fact that the tenant’s late notice was due to negligence. Of course a tenant who has intentionally delayed should not be relieved of a forfeiture simply because this tenant, who was merely inadvertent, may be granted equitable relief. But, on the other hand, we do not believe that this tenant, or any tenant, guilty only of negligence should be denied equitable relief because some other tenant, in some other case, may be found to have acted in bad faith. By its nature equitable relief must always depend on the facts of the particular case and not on hypotheticals.</p>
<p id="03990f81-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="823" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-823">p. 823</span>Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and a new trial granted.</p>

<p id="03990f83-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this State, as in others, relief has been afforded tenants threatened with loss of an expected renewal period (see, generally, Effect of Lessee’s Failure or Delay in Giving Notice Within Specified Time, of Intention to Renew Lease, Ann., 44 A.L.R.2d 1359, esp. 1362-1369). But in New York, as elsewhere, the circumstances conditioning such relief have been carefully limited. It is only where the tenant can show, not mere negligence, but an excuse such as fraud, mistake, or accident, that is, one or more of the categories common and integral to invocation of equity, that courts have, despite the literal agreement and intention of the parties, stepped in to prevent a loss (see, e.g., Jones v. Gianferante, 305 N.Y. 135, 138-139, 111 N.E.2d 419, 420, supra; 1 McAdam, Landlord and Tenant [5th ed.], §156, pp. 721-722).</p>
<p id="03990f84-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even in the case of excusable default by the tenant the court looks to the investment the tenant has made to bolster his right to equitable relief. But the fact of tenant investment alone is not enough to justify intervention. . . . In no case of accepted or acceptable authority . . . were improvements alone enough to help the negligent tenant. . . . </p>
<p id="03990f85-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . For reasons that are not persuasive [the majority] would distinguish, however, between mere neglect or forgetfulness and gross or willful negligence, whatever that might be. . . . This is not a distinction generally accepted and is hardly a pragmatic one to apply in an area where the opportunities for distortion and manipulation are so great. The instability and uncertainty would be dangerous and would allow for ad hoc dispensations in particular cases without reliable rule so essential to commercial enterprise.</p>
<p id="03990f86-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To begin with, under the guise of sheer inadvertence, a tenant could gamble with a fluctuating market, at the expense of his landlord, by delaying his decision beyond the time fixed in the agreement. The market having resolved in favor of exercising the option, the landlord, even though the day appointed in the agreement has passed, could be held to the return set out in the option, although if the market had resolved otherwise, the tenant could not be held to the renewal period.</p>
<p id="03990f87-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">None of this is to say that the tenant in this case was guilty of any manipulation. Hardly so. But what the court is concerned with is a rule for this case which perforce must cover other cases of like kind, where there will be no assurance that the “forgetfulness” is no more than that. The worst of the matter is that the kind of paltry record made in this case is hardly one on which a new rule with potential for mischief should be based. When the option, especially one requiring notice well in advance of the expiration of the lease, permits of economic manipulation, in commercial fairness the parties, especially if represented by counsel, should be held to their bargain, if plainly expressed.</p>
<p id="03990f88-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Considering investments in the premises or the renewal term a “forfeiture” as alone warranting equitable relief would undermine if not dissolve the general <span title="824" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-824">p. 824</span>rule upon which there is agreement. For, it is difficult to imagine a dilatory commercial tenant, particularly one in litigation over a renewal, who would not or could not point, scrupulously or unscrupulously, to some threatened investment in the premises, be it a physical improvement or the fact of good will. As a practical matter, it is not unreasonable to expect the commercial tenant, as compared with his residential counterpart, to protect his business interests with meticulousness, a meticulousness to which he would hold his landlord. All he, or his lawyer, need do is red-flag the date on which he has to act.</p>
<p id="03993699-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having established no excuse, other than its own carelessness, Chelsea’s claim is unfounded. Even if Chelsea honestly thought it enjoyed a 30-year lease, it does not change the result. Nor is it helpful to argue that Chelsea, always represented by a lawyer, was unable to procure a copy of the entire lease agreement. Indeed, it borders on the utterly incredible that experienced, sophisticated businessmen and their lawyers would not have assembled and scrutinized every relevant document affecting a longterm lease covering, with a renewal, a 30-year period.</p>
<p id="0399369a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That adherence to well-settled principles, like a Statute of Limitations or a Statute of Frauds, works a hardship on some does not, alone, permit a court to depart from sound doctrine and principles.

In Comment <i>b</i> to §229, quoted in the <i>enXco</i> opinion, the Restatement (Second) defines “forfeiture” as “the denial of compensation that results when the obligee loses [its] right to the agreed exchange after [it] has relied substantially, as by preparation or performance on the expectation of that exchange.” See, e.g., Aeolus Down, Inc. v. Credit Suisse Int’l, 2011 WL 5570062 (S.D.N.Y.)

<li class=""><p id="039936a5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Forfeiture in lease renewal cases.</i> Despite the close division of the court, <i>JNA</i> appears to have become a leading case for the principle of equitable relief against forfeiture, for tenants seeking to renew and in some other types of cases as well. A number of later New York decisions have followed <i>JNA</i> in lease renewal cases, despite late notice of intent to renew or other obstacles to extension; others have distinguished it on various grounds. Compare 135 East 57th Street LLC v. Daffy’s Inc., 934 N.Y.S.2d 112 (App. Div. 2011) (excusing renewal notice given four days late due to honest mistake; no prejudice to landlord and risk of forfeiture by tenant in loss of goodwill from having retail location for 15 years, even though no building improvements; equity would also consider that more than 100 employees might lose jobs if store closed), with 95 East Main Street Serv. Station, Inc. v. H &amp; D All Type Auto Repair, Inc., 556 N.Y.S.2d 385 (App. Div. 1990) (lease required nine months’ notice of renewal but tenant gave notice only one day before expiration of term; no showing of investment that would be forfeited or long-standing interest in location, and indication that tenant deliberately delayed renewing while looking for another location). Courts in other states are divided on the issue whether a tenant’s negligent failure to give timely notice to renew should be excusable on some basis. E.g., Heartland Delaware Inc. v. Rehoboth Mall Ltd. P’ship, 57 A.3d 917 (Del. Ch. 2012) (noting split among courts on equitable relief when delay is slight, harm to lessor is small, and hardship on lessee would be unconscionable, before deciding not to grant relief in the absence of waiver, estoppel, fraud, or similar excuse; equity respects freedom of contract and will not save party from its own negligence).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="039936a6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Conditions of timely notice in options to purchase real estate.</i> In cases involving options to purchase real estate (as opposed to options to renew leases) courts almost uniformly have denied equitable relief to an option holder who fails to comply with the time period set forth in the option. E.g., Livesey v. Copps Corp., 280 N.W.2d 339 (Wis. Ct. App. 1979) (exercise of option expiring November 15 ineffective when notice of exercise received November 16; deposited acceptance rule does not apply to options). Are there factors that justify treating options to purchase real estate differently from options for lease renewal? A different problem is presented when the option to purchase is contained in a lease, and the prospective purchaser has already been in possession as a lessee. Here some courts have followed <i>JNA</i> by giving the prospective purchaser an enforceable right despite some defect in her exercise of the option. E.g., Pitkin Seafood, Inc. v. Pitrock Realty Corp., 536 N.Y.S.2d 527 (A.D. 1989) (lessee’s exercise of option to purchase would be upheld despite fact letter was mistakenly sent in individual name of original tenant instead of name of closely held corporation to which she had assigned leasehold; valuable improvements had been <span title="826" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-826">p. 826</span>made to premises and landlord not misled or prejudiced by honest error). See also Bachorz v. Miller-Forslund, 812 F. Supp. 2d 83 (D. Mass. 2011) (lessee’s exercise of option to purchase would be upheld despite “inconsequential and immaterial” failures to comply with lease by not getting written permission for sublease and improvements to property and by minor noncompliance with municipal ordinances; no harm of any kind to lessor who had also waived some defaults).</p></li>

<p id="03995cb8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In some cases, the court must decide whether a given event stated as a condition should be regarded as conditioning <i>both</i> parties’ duties of performance under the contract, in which case either one can insist on its nonoccurrence as a ground for nonperformance, or whether it properly conditions the duty of only one party, in which case it is waivable by that party acting alone. See, e.g., De Freitas v. Cote, 174 N.E.2d 371 (Mass. 1961) (where contract stated “this sale is subject to [federal] loan,” buyer who obtained financing from other sources could enforce contract against seller; condition was clearly for benefit of buyer only and thus waivable by him); Howard v.

In an article inspired by the presentations of the participants at a 1988 conference at New York University Law School on the general topic “Contract Law: From Theory to Practice,” Professor Knapp reviewed the facts and procedural history of the <i>JNA</i> case (including facts not contained in the above opinions), in order to consider whether the insights of modern legal theory could inform the decision-making process for a judge faced with a case like <i>JNA.</i> Charles L. Knapp, Judgment Call: Theoretical Approaches to Contract Decision-Making, 1988 Ann. Surv. Am. L. 307. (The papers and proceedings of the N.Y.U. conference can be found in the 1988 Ann. Surv. Am. L. 1-351. In addition to articles by Professors Crystal and Knapp, the proceedings include principal papers by Professors James J. White (Legal Realism), Jeffrey L. Harrison (Economic Analysis), Peter Linzer (Relational Theory), and Girardeau A. Spann (Critical Legal Studies).) Professor Knapp concluded that each of these theoretical perspectives can contribute to the court’s understanding of the values and interests at stake in the decision, but that none appears to provide a sure answer for the judge in search of a just and principled outcome. No rule, no policy, no principle of justice inevitably controls the judge’s action in such a case, he observed; in the end, it comes down to a moral decision by the individual judge.

Suppose you had represented the landlord, JNA, at the time when Chelsea’s exercise of its renewal option was about to be due (i.e., <i>before</i> the New York Court of Appeals had handed down the above opinion). If your client, aware of the fact that Chelsea was in the process of making some improvements to the property but desiring for some reason to terminate that tenancy, had asked you whether it should remind Chelsea of the necessity for timely written exercise of the option, what would you have said? Would it have mattered why your client wanted to terminate that lease? If the time for exercise of the renewal option came and went, with no word from Chelsea, would you have advised JNA that it was then free to rerent the premises to someone else, effective at the expiration of Chelsea’s present term? (In preparing his article on the <i>JNA</i> case, Professor Knapp surveyed some practicing attorneys on these questions; the results are summarized in 1988 Ann. Surv. Am. L. 321-323.) Suppose you were representing a New York commercial landlord (residential tenancies may have different rules) in a similar situation today. In light of the <i>JNA</i> decision, how would you now advise your client, as the time for exercise of the option was approaching? What would you advise if that time had passed and no notice of renewal had been received from Chelsea?</p></li>

In addition to surveys of practicing lawyers, Professor Knapp also interviewed the attorneys who represented Chelsea and JNA in the litigation. According to the lawyer for JNA, a substantial increase in property values motivated JNA to claim that Chelsea had lost its right to renew. The increase in property values (as well as the trouble and expense associated with moving) could also explain Chelsea’s determination to try to enforce the renewal provision. The parties eventually settled the case by negotiating a long-term lease at an increased rental. See Knapp, 1988 Ann. Surv. Am. L. at 327 n.86.</p></li>

<p id="03995cbe-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our discussion of express conditions, we suggested a number of respects in which the proper treatment of conditions might be problematic: The extent to which one party might have the ability by “waiving” the condition to hold the other to her performance obligation; the possibility that one party or the other (or both) might have a duty to cause the conditioning event to happen, or at least to cooperate in bringing it about; the point at which nonoccurrence of the conditioning event might release a party from his duty to perform, etc. The questions below pursue some of these issues, by posing a set of variations based on a simple underlying fact pattern.</p>
<p id="03995cbf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Basic Facts: Robert Sellar is the owner of a house and lot in the residential area of Smalltown. On March 15, Sellar and Bonnie Byer entered into a written agreement by the terms of which Sellar agreed to sell the house and lot (“the Property”) to Byer for a total purchase price of $65,000, and Byer agreed to buy the property for that price. By the terms of the Sellar-Byer agreement, the closing (transfer of <span title="828" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-828">p. 828</span>title in exchange for payment of the purchase price) was to take place on or about June 15. In addition, the agreement also contained the following language:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="03995cc0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is agreed that this transaction is conditioned on the ability of Byer to obtain by June 1, from the Smalltown Zoning Board, a variance permitting Byer to operate on the premises a drug rehabilitation outpatient clinic, of the type currently operated by Byer in Middleburg [a nearby city].</p>
<p id="03995cc1-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(a) In March, Byer applies to the zoning board of Smalltown for a variance as described above. The board formally denies that request on May 25. On May 26, Byer notifies Sellar of this fact by letter, and states in her letter, “As you can see, this means that my projected purchase of your property will not take place.” On June 20, Sellar sells his property to Frank Fallbach for $60,000. Is Byer liable to Sellar in damages for breach of contract?</p>
<p id="03995cc2-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(b) In March, Byer makes a preliminary application to the zoning board for a variance as described above. In early April, the board furnishes Byer with a set of application forms and a list of documents to be furnished in order for her application to be processed. Byer never completes and files those forms and other papers. On June 5, Byer advises Sellar by letter that no variance was granted, and states, “As you can see, this means that my projected purchase of your property will not take place.” On June 20, Sellar sells his property to Fallbach for $60,000. Is Byer liable to Sellar in damages for breach of contract?</p>

In early April, the board furnishes Byer with a set of application forms and a list of supporting papers to be furnished in order for her application to be processed. Byer completes the forms and files them with the board, and supplies the board with as many of the requested additional documents as she can. However, one of the papers requested by the board is a written statement from each adjoining landowner, either giving consent to the variance or specifying the reasons for objection. One of the pieces of adjoining land is also owned by Sellar. At Byer’s request, Sellar files with the zoning board a written statement. In his statement, however, Sellar states that he does not consent to the requested variance, but strongly opposes it, because of the negative impact such a clinic would in his opinion have on the neighborhood. The Board denies Byer’s request on May 25. On June 10, Sellar sells the property to Fallbach for $75,000. Is Sellar liable to Byer in damages for breach of contract?</p>
<p id="03995cc4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(d) In March, Byer applies for the zoning variance described above, but her application is denied in early May. In the meantime, Byer has entered into negotiations with Fallbach concerning the Property. On May 25, Byer and Fallbach enter into an agreement whereby Byer agrees to sell the Property to Fallbach for $75,000, closing to take place on June 30. That agreement contains a clause conditioning Byer’s obligation to sell on the consummation and closing of her purchase from Sellar on or before June 25. On May 26, Byer writes Sellar requesting that closing of Byer’s purchase of the Property take place on June 15, at a specified time and place. On June 10, Sellar notifies Byer by letter that due to Byer’s failure to obtain a zoning variance, the Sellar-Byer contract is terminated. On June 15, Sellar sells the property to Fallbach for $70,000.

At this point, however, we are assuming an agreement that meets all the conventional tests for enforceability, binding both parties to an exchange of performances. At some point in the life of such a contract, one party may completely fail to render a performance then due and owing under the contract. Or, she may render that performance, but in an incomplete, defective or untimely manner. The following case is a classic examination of the issue thus raised: When does one party’s failure to perform justify the other party in refusing to render a performance of his own?</p>

The plaintiff built a country residence for the defendant at a cost of upwards of $77,000, and now sues to recover a balance of $3,483.46, remaining unpaid. The work of construction ceased in June, 1914, and the defendant then began to occupy the dwelling. There was no complaint of defective performance until March, 1915. One of the specifications for the plumbing work provides that —</p>
<p id="039983de-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“All wrought-iron pipe must be well galvanized, lap welded pipe of the grade known as ‘standard pipe’ of Reading manufacture.”</p>
<p id="039983df-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant learned in March, 1915, that some of the pipe, instead of being made in Reading, was the product of other factories. The plaintiff was accordingly directed by the architect to do the work anew. The plumbing was then encased within the walls except in a few places where it had to be exposed. Obedience to the order meant more than the substitution of other pipe. It meant the demolition at great expense of substantial parts of the completed structure. The plaintiff left the work untouched, and asked for a certificate that the final payment was due. Refusal of the certificate was followed by this suit.</p>
<p id="039983e0-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The evidence sustains a finding that the omission of the prescribed brand of pipe was neither fraudulent nor willful. It was the result of the oversight and inattention of the plaintiff’s subcontractor. Reading pipe is distinguished from Cohoes pipe and other brands only by the name of the manufacturer stamped upon it at intervals of between six and seven feet. Even the defendant’s architect, though he inspected the pipe upon arrival, failed to notice the discrepancy. The plaintiff tried to show that the brands installed, though made by other manufacturers, were the same in quality, in appearance, in market value, and in cost as the brand stated in the contract — that they were, indeed, the same thing, though <span title="830" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-830">p. 830</span>manufactured in another place.

<p id="039983e4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think the evidence, if admitted, would have supplied some basis for the inference that the defect was insignificant in its relation to the project. The courts never say that one who makes a contract fills the measure of his duty by less than full performance. They do say, however, that an omission, both trivial and innocent, will sometimes be atoned for by allowance of the resulting damage, and will not always be the breach of a condition to be followed by a forfeiture. Spence v. Ham, 163 N.Y. 220, 57 N.E. 412, 51 L.R.A. 238. . . . The distinction is akin to that between dependent and independent promises, or between promises and conditions. Anson on Contracts (Corbin’s ed.) §367; 2 Williston on Contracts, §842. Some promises are so plainly independent that they can never by fair construction be conditions of one another. . . . Others are so plainly dependent that they must always be conditions. Others, though dependent and thus conditions when there is departure in point of substance, will be viewed as independent and collateral when the departure is insignificant. 2 Williston on Contracts, §§841, 842; Eastern Forge Co. v. Corbin, 182 Mass. 590, 592, 66 N.E. 419. . . . Considerations partly of justice and partly of presumable intention are to tell us whether this or that promise shall be placed in one class or in another. The simple and the uniform will call for different remedies from the multifarious and the intricate. The margin of departure within the range of normal expectation upon a sale of common chattels will vary from the margin to be expected upon a contract for the construction of a mansion or a “skyscraper.” There will be harshness sometimes and oppression in the implication of a condition when the thing upon which labor has been expended <span title="831" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-831">p. 831</span>is incapable of surrender because united to the land, and equity and reason in the implication of a like condition when the subject-matter, if defective, is in shape to be returned. From the conclusion that promises may not be treated as dependent to the extent of their uttermost minutiae without a sacrifice of justice, the progress is a short one to the conclusion that they may not be so treated without a perversion of intention. Intention not otherwise revealed may be presumed to hold in contemplation the reasonable and probable. If something else is in view, it must not be left to implication. There will be no assumption of a purpose to visit venial faults with oppressive retribution.</p>
<p id="039983e5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those who think more of symmetry and logic in the development of legal rules than of practical adaptation to the attainment of a just result will be troubled by a classification where the lines of division are so wavering and blurred. Something, doubtless, may be said on the score of consistency and certainty in favor of a stricter standard. The courts have balanced such considerations against those of equity and fairness, and found the latter to be the weightier. The decisions in this state commit us to the liberal view, which is making its way, nowadays, in jurisdictions slow to welcome it. Dakin &amp; Co. v. Lee, 1916, 1 K.B. 566, 579. Where the line is to be drawn between the important and the trivial cannot be settled by a formula. “In the nature of the case precise boundaries are impossible.” 2 Williston on Contracts, §841. The same omission may take on one aspect or another according to its setting. Substitution of equivalents may not have the same significance in fields of art on the one side and in those of mere utility on the other. Nowhere will change be tolerated, however, if it is so dominant or pervasive as in any real or substantial measure to frustrate the purpose of the contract. Crouch v. Gutmann, 134 N.Y. 45, 51, 31 N.E. 271, 30 Am. St. Rep. 608. There is no general license to install whatever, in the builder’s judgment, may be regarded as “just as good.” Easthampton L. &amp; C. Co., Ltd., v. Worthington, 186 N.Y. 407, 412, 79 N.E. 323. The question is one of degree, to be answered, if there is doubt, by the triers of the facts (Crouch v. Gutmann; Woodward v. Fuller, supra), and, if the inferences are certain, by the judges of the law (Easthampton L. &amp; C. Co., Ltd., v. Worthington, supra). We must weigh the purpose to be served, the desire to be gratified, the excuse for deviation from the letter, the cruelty of enforced adherence. Then only can we tell whether literal fulfillment is to be implied by law as a condition. This is not to say that the parties are not free by apt and certain words to effectuate a purpose that performance of every term shall be a condition of recovery. That question is not here. This is merely to say that the law will be slow to impute the purpose, in the silence of the parties, where the significance of the default is grievously out of proportion to the oppression of the forfeiture. The willful transgressor must accept the penalty of his transgression. Schultze v. Goodstein, 180 N.Y. 248, 251, 73 N.E. 21; Desmond-Dunne Co. v. Friedman-Doscher Co., 162 N.Y. 486, 490, 56 N.E. 995. For him there is no occasion to mitigate the rigor of implied conditions. The transgressor whose default is unintentional and trivial may hope for mercy if he will offer atonement for his wrong. Spence v. Ham, supra.</p>
<p id="039983e6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the circumstances of this case, we think the measure of the allowance is not the cost of replacement, which would be great, but the difference in value, <span title="832" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-832">p. 832</span>which would be either nominal or nothing. Some of the exposed sections might perhaps have been replaced at moderate expense. The defendant did not limit his demand to them, but treated the plumbing as a unit to be corrected from cellar to roof. In point of fact, the plaintiff never reached the stage at which evidence of the extent of the allowance became necessary. The trial court had excluded evidence that the defect was unsubstantial, and in view of that ruling there was no occasion for the plaintiff to go farther with an offer of proof. We think, however, that the offer, if it had been made, would not of necessity have been defective because directed to difference in value. It is true that in most cases the cost of replacement is the measure. Spence v. Ham, supra. The owner is entitled to the money which will permit him to complete, unless the cost of completion is grossly and unfairly out of proportion to the good to be attained. When that is true, the measure is the difference in value. Specifications call, let us say, for a foundation built of granite quarried in Vermont. On the completion of the building, the owner learns that through the blunder of a subcontractor part of the foundation has been built of granite of the same quality quarried in New Hampshire. The measure of allowance is not the cost of reconstruction. “There may be omissions of that which could not afterwards be supplied exactly as called for by the contract without taking down the building to its foundations, and at the same time the omission may not affect the value of the building for use or otherwise, except so slightly as to be hardly appreciable.” Handy v. Bliss, 204 Mass. 513, 519, 90 N.E. 864, 134 Am. St. Rep. 673. . . . The rule that gives a remedy in cases of substantial performance with compensation for defects of trivial or inappreciable importance has been developed by the courts as an instrument of justice. The measure of the allowance must be shaped to the same end.</p>

<p id="0399aafa-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under its contract it obligated itself to use in the plumbing only pipe (between 2,000 and 2,500 feet) made by the Reading Manufacturing Company. The first pipe delivered was about 1,000 feet and the plaintiff’s superintendent then called the attention of the foreman of the subcontractor, who was doing the plumbing, to the fact that the specifications annexed to the contract required all pipe used in the plumbing to be of the Reading Manufacturing Company. They then examined it for the purpose of ascertaining whether this delivery was of that manufacture and found it was. Thereafter, as pipe was required in the progress of the work, the foreman of the subcontractor would leave word at its shop that he wanted a specified number of feet of pipe, without in any way indicating of what manufacture. Pipe would thereafter be delivered and installed in the building, without any examination whatever. Indeed, no examination, so far as appears, was made <span title="833" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-833">p. 833</span>by the plaintiff, the subcontractor, defendant’s architect, or any one else, of any of the pipe except the first delivery, until after the building had been completed. Plaintiff’s architect then refused to give the certificate of completion, upon which the final payment depended, because all of the pipe used in the plumbing was not of the kind called for by the contract. After such refusal, the subcontractor removed the covering or insulation from about 900 feet of pipe which was exposed in the basement, cellar, and attic, and all but 70 feet was found to have been manufactured, not by the Reading Company, but by other manufacturers, some by the Cohoes Rolling Mill Company, some by the National Steel Works, some by the South Chester Tubing Company, and some which bore no manufacturer’s mark at all. The balance of the pipe had been so installed in the building that an inspection of it could not be had without demolishing, in part at least, the building itself.</p>
<p id="0399aafb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I am of the opinion the trial court was right in directing a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff agreed that all the pipe used should be of the Reading Manufacturing Company. Only about two-fifths of it, so far as appears, was of that kind. If more were used, then the burden of proving that fact was upon the plaintiff, which it could easily have done, since it knew where the pipe was obtained. The question of substantial performance of a contract of the character of the one under consideration depends in no small degree upon the good faith of the contractor. If the plaintiff had intended to, and had, complied with the terms of the contract except as to minor omissions, due to inadvertence, then he might be allowed to recover the contract price, less the amount necessary to fully compensate the defendant for damages caused by such omissions. Woodward v. Fuller, 80 N.Y. 312; Nolan v. Whitney, 88 N.Y. 648. But that is not this case. It installed between 2,000 and 2,500 feet of pipe, of which only 1,000 feet at most complied with the contract. No explanation was given why pipe called for by the contract was not used, nor was any effort made to show what it would cost to remove the pipe of other manufacturers and install that of the Reading Manufacturing Company. The defendant had a right to contract for what he wanted. He had a right before making payment to get what the contract called for. It is no answer to this suggestion to say that the pipe put in was just as good as that made by the Reading Manufacturing Company, or that the difference in value between such pipe and the pipe made by the Reading Manufacturing Company would be either “nominal or nothing.” Defendant contracted for pipe made by the Reading Manufacturing Company. What his reason was for requiring this kind of pipe is of no importance. He wanted that and was entitled to it. It may have been a mere whim on his part, but even so, he had a right to this kind of pipe, regardless of whether some other kind, according to the opinion of the contractor or experts, would have been “just as good, better, or done just as well.” He agreed to pay only upon condition that the pipe installed were made by that company and he ought not to be compelled to pay unless that condition be performed. . . . Smith v. Brady, 17 N.Y. 173, and authorities cited on page 185, 72 Am. Dec. 442. The rule, therefore, of substantial performance, with damages for unsubstantial omissions, has no application. . . . </p>

The specifications of the contract become the law between the parties until voluntarily changed. If the owner prefers a plain and simple Doric column, and has so provided in the agreement, the contractor has no right to put in its place the more costly and elegant Corinthian. If the owner, having regard to strength and durability, has contracted for walls of specified materials to be laid in a particular manner, or for a given number of joists and beams, the builder has no right to substitute his own judgment or that of others. Having departed from the agreement, if performance has not been waived by the other party, the law will not allow him to allege that he has made as good a building as the one he engaged to erect. He can demand payment only upon and according to the terms of his contract, and if the conditions on which payment is due have not been performed, then the right to demand it does not exist. To hold a different doctrine would be simply to make another contract, and would be giving to parties an encouragement to violate their engagements, which the just policy of the law does not permit.

<li class=""><p id="0399ab07-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Commercial context.</i> Does the opinion of the court adequately explain the reasons for the dispute? Richard Danzig’s research into the background of the case is revealing. Danzig tried to find out why the contract specified Reading pipe. At that time, two types of pipe, steel and wrought iron, were commonly used in construction. Although wrought iron was approximately 30 percent more expensive, its manufacturers claimed that use of the pipe would achieve substantial savings because of durability and low maintenance. Several companies manufactured wrought iron pipe, but evidence indicates that all of their pipe was of the same quality. However, manufacturers of wrought iron pipe cautioned buyers to specify a particular manufacturer in order to avoid receiving “wrought pipe,” a cheaper product produced by steel companies using scrap steel. Considering this background, the contractor’s deviation from the specifications seems immaterial since genuine wrought iron pipe (although not of Reading manufacture) was in fact used. Why then did Kent continue to insist on Reading pipe if genuine wrought iron pipe had in fact <span title="835" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-835">p. 835</span>been used? Kent moved into the house in June 1914, after substantial construction delays. According to Danzig’s research, Kent was probably disenchanted with the contractor because of the delay, as well as some other mistakes in the work, and may have been searching for some reason to withhold the balance due on the contract. Richard Danzig &amp; Geoffrey R. Watson, The Capability Problem in Contract Law 109-116 (2d ed. 2004). For further background on the Kent contract and the ensuing litigation, see Victor P. Goldberg, Rethinking Jacob &amp; Youngs v. Kent, 66 Case W. Res. L. Rev. 111 (2015). Professor Goldberg finds that the doctrine of substantial performance was already established by the time Judge Cardozo wrote the opinion, and defends both the rule and the result.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0399ab08-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>The doctrine of constructive conditions.</i> In deciding the <i>Jacob &amp; Youngs</i> case, Judge Cardozo uses the notion of “dependent promises,” promises that are treated like “conditions.” We have already considered cases where one party’s duty of performance has been expressly conditioned on the occurrence of some specified event, in which case that duty of performance will not arise (absent some excuse of the condition) unless and until the conditioning event occurs. In cases like <i>Jacob &amp; Youngs</i>, the courts use similar terminology to answer a somewhat different question: When will one party’s duty of performance be dependent on (thus in effect “conditioned” on) some performance by the other party? The doctrine of “constructive conditions” was developed over the years by English and American courts in order to achieve just results in cases where it seemed to the court that one party’s failure to perform (or even to “tender” performance) should constitute a sufficient justification for the other party’s withholding of its performance in return. (The history of the doctrine is discussed further in the Comment that follows these Notes.)</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0399ab09-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Possible application of rules governing express conditions.</i> In the course of his opinion, Cardozo indicates that the case involves an implied, or “constructive” condition, rather than an express one: “This is not to say that the parties are not free by apt and certain words to effectuate a purpose that performance of every term shall be a condition of recovery. That question is not here.” However, the case could easily have been treated as involving an express rather than a constructive condition. Article IX of the contract provided that the contractor was to be paid by the owner “only upon certificates of the Architect.” Richard Danzig &amp; Geoffrey R. Watson, The Capability Problem in Contract Law 98 (2d ed. 2004). The contractor brought suit when the architect failed to issue a final certificate because the contractor refused to replace the non-Reading pipe. Under New York law the result in the case would probably have been the same whether the case was treated as involving an express condition of the architect’s certificate or a constructive condition of performance by the contractor. An earlier New York case had held that an architect could not properly refuse to issue a certificate if the contractor had substantially performed. Nolan v. Whitney, 88 N.Y. 648 (1882). In other jurisdictions, however, the result might well be different. According to the majority view, if the contractor’s right to receive payment is expressly conditioned on the issuance of the architect’s certificate, the condition will be strictly enforced and the contractor denied <span title="836" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-836">p. 836</span>recovery unless the contractor shows some ground for excuse of the condition such as fraud, bad faith, or waiver. See, e.g., Glenn Constr. Co., LLC v. Bell Aerospace Services, Inc., 2009 WL 5174209 (M.D. Ala.); Town of Plainfield v. Paden Eng’g Co., Inc., 943 N.E.2d 904 (Ind. Ct. App. 2011).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0399d21a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Principle of substantial performance.</i> Even though <i>Jacob &amp; Youngs</i> could have been treated as a case involving express conditions, instead it is recognized as the leading case adopting the principle of “substantial performance.” Substantial performance can best be understood as one aspect of the doctrine of constructive conditions. The principle provides that each party’s duty of performance is implicitly conditioned on there being no uncured material failure of performance by the other party. Restatement (Second) §237. Minor or immaterial deviations from the contractual provisions do not amount to failure of a condition to the other party’s duty to perform. As Justice Cardozo recognizes, even a minor deviation will give the other party a right to recover damages for that nonperformance, but those damages may be negligible. (Was the house worth less on the market because non-Reading pipe was used, when all manufacturers of wrought iron pipe made a product of the same quality?) Does the dissenting judge disagree with Justice Cardozo on the recognition of the doctrine of substantial performance or merely on its application?</p></li>

Jones, 197 P. 105 (Cal. 1921) the California Supreme Court defined substantial performance as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="0399d21c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]here is substantial performance where the variance from the specifications of the contract does not impair the building or structure as a whole, and where after it is erected the building is actually used for the intended purpose, or where the defects can be remedied without great expenditure and without material damage to other parts of the structure, but . . . the defects must not run through the whole work, so that the object of the owner to have the work done in a particular way is not accomplished . . . nor be so substantial [that] . . . the allowance out of the contract price will not give the owner essentially what he contracted for.</p>
</div>
<p id="0399d21d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Id. at 108. In Flynn Builders, L.C. v. Lande, 814 N.W.2d 542 (Iowa 2012), the Iowa Supreme Court held that the contractor had not substantially performed when he had completed about 80 to 85 percent of the work on the house under a contract that had a total price of about $260,000. The unfinished work included doors, cabinets, drywall, flooring, painting, concrete work, and heating and air conditioning, and it was estimated to require about 5 to 7 weeks to complete. The court noted that while no mathematical rule can be stated regarding the percentage of completion required by a builder, the unfinished work in the case “materially affected the habitability of the house” and precluded a finding that substantial performance had been rendered. Id. at 547. On remand, however, the trial court found that the contractor’s failure to render substantial performance was excused by the owner’s previous failure to make payments when due; this ruling was affirmed by the Iowa Supreme Court, Flynn Builders, L.C. v. Lande, 814 N.W.2d 542 (2012).</p>
<p id="0399d21e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="837" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-837">p. 837</span>The substantial performance doctrine applies to all types of agreements, not just to construction contracts. See Nature’s Plus Nordic A/S v. Natural Organics, Inc., 980 F. Supp. 2d 400 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (exclusive distributor who purchased at least 99.5 percent of required annual amount of $600,000 had substantially performed as a matter of law; manufacturer was not excused from contract on basis of immaterial breach); Hull v. Giesler, 331 P.3d 507 (Idaho 2014) (buyer substantially performed contract to purchase one-half interest in parcel of land by paying amount due in installments over five-year period even though some payments were late; material breach is one that “touches fundamental purpose of contract” and “defeats the purpose of the parties”); Viacom International Inc. v. MGA Entertainment, Inc., 2016 WL 7448142 (C.D. Cal.) (plaintiff entitled to summary judgment where it had substantially performed contract to broadcast TV series internationally by achieving at least 96 percent compliance with its contractual obligation).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0399d21f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Measure of damages.</i> The notion of “substantial performance” as the fulfillment of a “constructive condition” to the other party’s duty of performance may be important where the person rendering defective performance is attempting to enforce the other party’s return performance, as was the case in <i>Jacob &amp; Youngs.</i> But as that case illustrates, this is not the only issue that may turn on the degree and quality of performance rendered. Whether performance is deemed “substantial” or not, it may still be defective in important ways, requiring the court to consider what damage measure will appropriately remedy those defects. Sometimes courts will measure damages in cases of defective performance by the cost of completion or repair. E.g., Lewis Electric Co. v. Miller, 791 N.W.2d 691 (Iowa 2011) (electrical contractor who substantially performed but whose work was defective was entitled to recover remaining amount of contract price less cost to complete or repair incurred by owner; owner entitled to judgment for excess if costs to repair exceeded balance of contract price). In <i>Jacob &amp; Youngs</i>, what measure of damages did Cardozo employ? We will return to this issue in Chapter 10, in our discussion of expectation damages.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0399d220-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Effect of willful breach.</i> In his <i>Jacob &amp; Youngs</i> opinion, Cardozo states that the “willful transgressor” will not be entitled to recover under the substantial performance doctrine. Professor Corbin criticized this limitation, arguing that willfulness was a vague concept and that even a willful breach should not necessarily prevent recovery. 3A Corbin on Contracts §707 (1960). The Second Restatement adopts Professor Corbin’s view: A willful breach does not automatically bar recovery, but the motive of the breaching party is a factor to be considered in determining whether performance was substantial. Restatement (Second) §241(e) and Comment <i>f.</i> In Roudis v. Hubbard, 574 N.Y.S.2d 95 (App. Div. 1991), plaintiffs sought damages for defendant builder’s failure to install styrofoam insulation and footing drains in plaintiffs’ new home. The parties’ contract provided that if the final product substantially complied with the plans and specifications, the owners’ sole remedy should be market-value damages; defendant argued that because the defects in his performance did not diminish the value of the house, plaintiffs had suffered no compensable damages. The trial court’s judgment for plaintiffs was affirmed. Relying on <i>Jacob &amp; Youngs</i>, <span title="838" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-838">p. 838</span>the court held that since defendant apparently had intentionally omitted the drains and insulation called for because he thought them “unnecessary,” the proper remedy was the cost of completion. Even if the contractor has substantially performed, it declared, a “diminution in value” measure should be applied only where the contractor’s breach was unintentional and constituted substantial performance in good faith. Cf. First Nat’l Bank of Omaha v. Centennial Park, LLC, 303 P.3d 705 (Kan. Ct. App. 2013) (rule of substantial performance will not apply when the breach is a willful, intentional deviation from contract terms; borrower willfully breached loan repayment terms).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="0399d221-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Other grounds for recovery: restitution and divisibility.</i> If the contractor has not substantially performed, other bases for recovery may nonetheless exist. Many courts will allow a contractor that has committed a material breach to recover in restitution (quantum meruit) for the reasonable value of its services, less any harm resulting from the breach. See Kreyer v. Driscoll, 159 N.W.2d 680 (Wis. 1968). If the contract is “divisible,” a court may allow recovery for the portions that have been completed. See Carrig v. Gilbert-Varker Corp., 50 N.E.2d 59 (Mass. 1943) (contract for construction of 35 houses in groups of 10; contractor who completed 20 houses allowed to recover because contract was divisible). The Restatement (Second) §240 defines the doctrine of divisibility. It provides that two requirements must be met in order for a contract to be divisible. First, it must be possible to apportion the performances of the parties into corresponding pairs of part performances. Second, it must be proper to treat these pairs of part performances as “agreed equivalents.” Comment <i>e</i> to §240 explains that the second requirement is designed to protect the expectations of the contracting parties:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="0399d222-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is because fairness requires that a party, having received only a fraction of the performance that he expected under a contract, not be asked to pay an identical fraction of the price that he originally promised on the expectation of full performance, unless it appears that the performance that he actually received is worth to him roughly that same fraction of what full performance would have been worth to him.</p>

<p id="0399d224-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have seen in <i>Jacob &amp; Youngs</i> that the courts may use the terminology of “conditions” in deciding the consequences of one party’s nonperformance or defective performance on the other party’s contractual obligations. The use of the “condition” concept here is quite different from the idea of “express” conditions that we studied in the first section of this chapter. While express conditions result from the agreement of the parties, “constructive conditions” are judicially created devices, used to determine the consequences of breach when the parties have failed to spell that out in their agreement. (It is, of course, possible to argue that the rules of constructive conditions actually reflect the agreements that the parties probably would have reached had they actually bargained about the matter.)</p>
<p id="0399d225-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The modern rules of constructive conditions examined in these materials have a long lineage. The English courts of the early seventeenth century <span title="839" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-839">p. 839</span>originally rejected the idea that one party’s duty to perform was conditioned on performance by the other, holding that mutual promises in bilateral contracts were “independent.” Under this view, even if one party failed to perform his promise, the other was not justified in refusing to perform. An early case exemplifying this approach was Nichols v. Raynbred, 80 Eng. Rep. 238 (K.B. 1615), where the Court of King’s Bench held that in an action by a seller against a buyer for the purchase price of a cow, the seller was not required to plead that the cow had been delivered. The buyer could, of course, bring an independent action against the seller for breach of his promise to deliver the cow, but the buyer could not raise that fact as a defense in the seller’s action to recover the price. The promises of the buyer and seller were said to be “independent.”</p>
<p id="0399d226-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is some evidence that the rule of independent promises was not firmly established in the English common law. William H. McGovern, Jr., Dependent Promises in the History of Leases and Other Contracts, 52 Tul. L. Rev. 659 (1978) (contending that the English courts in fact held that promises in many types of contracts were dependent). Nevertheless, the conventional view is that the rule of independent promises remained the law until Lord Mansfield decided the case of Kingston v. Preston, reported as part of the argument in Jones v. Barkley, at 99 Eng. Rep. 437 (K.B. 1773). In <i>Kingston</i> the defendant, a silk merchant, agreed to sell his business to the plaintiff, his apprentice, who promised in return to pay the purchase price in monthly installments and to provide “good and sufficient security” to be approved by the defendant. The buyer brought suit, alleging that the seller had failed to honor his promise to complete the sale of the business. The seller pleaded in response that the buyer had failed to provide the promised security for his payment of the purchase price. The buyer demurred to this defense, arguing that the covenants were independent. Lord Mansfield’s analysis of the case is reported as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="0399d227-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are three kinds of covenants: 1. Such as are called mutual and independent, where either party may recover damages from the other, for the injury he may have received by a breach of the covenants in his favour, and where it is no excuse for the defendant, to allege a breach of the covenants on the part of the plaintiff. 2. There are covenants which are conditions and dependent, in which the performance of one depends on the prior performance of another, and, therefore, till this prior condition is performed, the other party is not liable to an action on his covenant. 3. There is also a third sort of covenants, which are mutual conditions to be performed at the same time; and, in these, if one party was ready, and offered, to perform his part, and the other neglected, or refused, to perform his, he who was ready, and offered, has fulfilled his engagement, and may maintain an action for the default of the other; though it is not certain that either is obliged to do the first act. — His Lordship then proceeded to say, that the dependence, or independence, of covenants, was to be collected from the evident sense and meaning of the parties. . . . That, in the case before the Court, it would be the greatest injustice if the plaintiff should prevail: the essence of the agreement was, that the defendant should not trust to the personal security of the plaintiff, but, before he delivered up his stock and business, should have good security for the payment of the money. The giving of such security, therefore, must necessarily be a condition precedent. — Judgment <span title="840" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-840">p. 840</span>was accordingly given for the defendant, because the part to be performed by the plaintiff was clearly a condition precedent.</p>
</div>
<p id="0399d228-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A subsequent English case, Morton v. Lamb, 101 Eng. Rep. 890 (K.B. 1797), added an important refinement to Mansfield’s doctrine of conditions. In <i>Morton</i> the plaintiff brought an action for failure to deliver corn. The defendant argued in arrest of judgment that the plaintiff had not declared that he was ready to pay for the corn. The court held that when two performances can be rendered at the same time, it should be presumed (in the absence of express agreement otherwise) that the parties intended them to be performed simultaneously, so that neither party would be required in effect to extend credit to the other. In such a case the party who sues for nonperformance must declare that he either performed, or at least was ready to perform, his own obligation. In other words, if acts can be performed at the same time, the readiness of each party to perform is a “concurrent condition” to the other party’s duty of performance. The court noted that in some kinds of contracts — construction and service contracts, for example — performances could not be rendered simultaneously. In such cases the performance requiring the longer period of time (rendering of services) is a “condition precedent” to the performance requiring the shorter period of time (payment of money).</p>
<p id="0399d229-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Except for changes in terminology, the Restatement (Second) continues the rules of “constructive conditions” developed by Lord Mansfield and subsequent English cases. The revised Restatement abandons the use of the terms <i>independent covenant, concurrent condition, condition precedent</i>, and <i>condition subsequent.</i> Following an analysis developed by Professor Corbin, the Restatement divides conditions into three categories: express conditions, implied-in-fact conditions (inferred from the conduct of the parties), and constructive conditions (created by a court for reasons of justice). Restatement (Second) §226, Comments <i>a, b.</i></p>
<p id="0399f93a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Restatement (Second) §234 sets forth the conventional rules on order of performance, as developed in Morton v. Lamb. Performances that can be rendered at the same time are due simultaneously. Restatement (Second) §234(1). See also Restatement (Second) §238. Under §234(2), if performances cannot be rendered at the same time, the performance requiring the longer period of time must be rendered before the performance requiring the shorter period of time will be due. Contracts for the conveyance of land or for the sale of goods are viewed by the law as being capable of simultaneous performance; absent agreement otherwise, they will be construed as calling for simultaneous rendition of performances. Under the rule of §234(1), it will thus be necessary for either party to such a contract — buyer or seller — to show that she has at least tendered performance on her part, in order to maintain an action for breach against the other party. To the same effect are UCC §§2-507 (tender of delivery a condition to buyer’s duty to accept and pay for goods) and 2-511 (tender of payment a condition to seller’s duty to deliver). Like the Restatement rules, the UCC provisions are rules of construction only and are not applicable if the parties’ agreement provides otherwise. (Note that Comment 1 to §2-511 observes that the requirement of payment against delivery has “no application” to most <span title="841" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-841">p. 841</span>commercial contracts for the sale of goods, which commonly extend credit to the buyer.) On the other hand, construction contracts and employment contracts are ordinarily construed as requiring performance of the work to be completed before payment is due, under the rule of §234(2). Again, it must be remembered that this is merely a rule of construction, applicable unless the language of the contract itself or the circumstances indicate otherwise; ordinarily such contracts do call for payment at stated intervals as the services are performed, or the work progresses.</p>
<p id="0399f93b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As thus elaborated, the doctrine of constructive conditions provides an analytic framework for the courts in various cases where one party claims he did not yet have a duty to perform because of the other party’s failure to render her performance. Use of the “condition” device in this fashion has had other consequences, however, and in some cases it has appeared to work against the interests of justice. A well-known early example is Stark v. Parker, 19 Mass. 267 (1824). Plaintiff Stark had contracted to work for a year as a laborer on defendant Parker’s farm, in exchange for the sum of $120. (A seemingly trivial sum, but this was 1824, remember; also, plaintiff probably received room and board.) For some reason not disclosed in the report of the case, the plaintiff had left the defendant’s service shortly before the year was up. Plaintiff was held not entitled to recover any part of his wages for the year and was also denied any recovery in quantum meruit for the value of the services performed. Full rendition of the entire performance contracted for, the court held, was a condition precedent to the right to recover <i>any</i> of the promised compensation, either “on the contract” or on a quantum meruit (restitutionary) basis. Stark v. Parker was generally followed, although some courts did hold otherwise on similar facts, permitting the employee at least to bring an action in quantum meruit for the reasonable value of the work performed, less damages for any loss that the employer could show was suffered as a result of the employee’s breach. E.g., Britton v. Turner, 6 N.H. 481 (1834). As exemplified in Britton v. Turner, the doctrine of restitution thus offers one way to ameliorate the possible harshness of the “constructive condition” approach. (We will return to this point in Chapter 11.) For a recent discussion of Britton v. Turner, see Charles A. Sullivan, Mastering the Faithless Servant?: Reconciling Employment Law, Contract Law, and Fiduciary Duty, 2011 Wis. L. Rev. 777. The other method devised by the courts to temper the effect of the doctrine of constructive conditions is of course the concept of “substantial performance” (which we saw in action in <i>Jacob &amp; Youngs</i>), permitting recovery “on the contract” by a party whose breach is not material.</p>

<p id="0399f944-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As of July 8, 1961, Spindler was the owner of a majority of the shares of S &amp; S Newspapers, a corporation which, since April 1, 1959, had owned and operated a newspaper in Santa Clara known as the Santa Clara Journal. In addition, Spindler, as president of S &amp; S Newspapers, served as publisher, editor, and general manager of the Journal. On July 8, 1961, Spindler entered into a written agreement with Sackett whereby the latter agreed to purchase 6,316 shares of stock in S &amp; S Newspapers, this number representing the total number of shares outstanding. The contract provided for a total purchase price of $85,000 payable as follows: $6,000 on or before July 10, $20,000 on or before July 14, and $59,000 on or before August 15. In addition the agreement obligated Sackett to pay interest at the rate of 6 percent on any unpaid balance. And finally, the contract provided for delivery of the full amount of stock to Sackett free of encumbrances when he made his final payment under the contract.</p>
<p id="0399f945-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sackett paid the initial $6,000 installment on time and made an additional $19,800 payment on July 21. On August 10 Sackett gave Spindler a check for the $59,200 balance due under the contract; however, due to the fact that the account on which this check was drawn contained insufficient funds to cover the check, the check was never paid. Meanwhile, however, Spindler had acquired the stock owned by the minority shareholders of S &amp; S Newspapers, had endorsed the stock certificates, and had given all but 454 shares to Sackett’s attorneys to hold in escrow until Sackett had paid Spindler the $59,200 balance due under the contract. However, on September 1, after the $59,200 check had not cleared, Spindler reclaimed the stock certificates held by Sackett’s attorney.</p>
<p id="0399f946-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thereafter, on September 12 Spindler received a telegram from Sackett to the effect that the latter “had secured payments our transaction and was ready, willing and eager to transfer them” and that Sackett’s new attorney would contact Spindler’s attorney. In response to this telegram Spindler, by return telegram, gave Sackett the name of Spindler’s attorney. Subsequently, Sackett’s attorney contacted Spindler’s attorney and arranged a meeting to discuss Sackett’s performance of the contract. At this meeting, which was held on September 19 at the office of Sackett’s attorney, in response to Sackett’s representation that he would be able to pay Spindler the balance due under the contract by September 22, Spindler served Sackett with a notice to the effect that unless the latter paid the $59,200 balance due under the contract plus interest by that date, Spindler would not consider completing the sale and would assess damages for Sackett’s breach of the agreement. Also discussed at this meeting was the newspaper’s urgent need for working capital. Pursuant to this discussion Sackett on the same date paid Spindler $3,944.26 as an advance <span title="843" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-843">p. 843</span>for working capital. However, Sackett failed to make any further payments or to communicate with Spindler by September 22, and on that date the latter, by letter addressed to Sackett, again extended the time for Sackett’s performance until September 29. Again Sackett failed to tender the amount owing under the contract or to contact Spindler by that date, the next communication between the parties occurring on October 4 in the form of a telegram by which Sackett advised Spindler that Sackett’s assets were now free as a result of the fact that his wife’s petition to impress a receivership on his assets had been dismissed by the trial court in which divorce proceedings between Sackett and his wife were pending; that he was “ready, eager and willing to proceed to . . . consummate all details of our previously settled sale and purchase”; and that the decision of the trial court dismissing his wife’s petition for receivership “will clear way shortly for full financing any unpaid balance.” Accordingly, Sackett, in this telegram, urged Spindler to have his attorney contact Sackett’s attorney “regarding any unfinished details.” In response to this telegram Spindler’s attorney, on October 5, wrote a letter to Sackett’s attorney stating that as a result of Sackett’s delay in performing the contract and his unwillingness to consummate the agreement, “there will be no sale and purchase of the stock. . . .” Following this letter Sackett’s attorney, on October 6, telephoned Spindler’s attorney and offered to pay the balance due under the contract over a period of time through a “liquidating trust.” This proposal was rejected by Spindler’s attorney, who, however, informed Sackett’s attorney at that time that Spindler was still willing to consummate the sale of the stock provided Sackett would pay the balance in cash or its equivalent. No tender or offer of cash or its equivalent was made and Sackett thereafter failed to communicate with Spindler until shortly before the commencement of this action.</p>
<p id="0399f947-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Beginning during the period scheduled for Sackett’s performance of the contract Spindler found it increasingly difficult to operate the paper at a profit, particularly due to the lack of adequate working capital. In an attempt to remedy this situation Spindler obtained a loan of approximately $4,000 by mortgaging various items of personal property owned by him. In addition, in November, Spindler sold half of his stock in S &amp; S Newspapers for $10,000. Thereafter, in December, in an effort to minimize the cost of operating the newspaper, Spindler converted the paper from a daily to a weekly. Finally, in July 1962 Spindler repurchased for $10,000 the stock which he had sold the previous November and sold the full 6,316 shares for $22,000, which sale netted Spindler $20,680 after payment of brokerage commission.</p>

<p id="039a2059-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . To begin with, the undisputed evidence shows that of the $85,000 due from Sackett to Spindler under the purchase agreement the total amount which the former paid to the latter up to the time of trial was $29,744.26. Moreover, the purchase agreement reveals that Sackett’s promise to pay Spindler $85,000 was an unconditional one once the respective dates on which the payments were due had arrived. Accordingly, since the trial court found that it was not impossible for Sackett to perform the subject contract either by virtue of his <span title="844" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-844">p. 844</span>illness and hospitalization or his pending divorce litigation, it is clear that his failure to tender the balance due under the contract constituted a breach of the agreement, a breach being defined as an unjustified or unexcused failure to perform all or any part of what is promised in a contract. (Rest., Contracts, §§312, 314, pp. 462, 465.) The question remains, therefore, as to whether Sackett’s duty to consummate the contract or to respond to Spindler in damages for the former’s failure to perform the subject contract was in any way discharged by Spindler’s conduct. . . . </p>
<p id="039a205a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . [W]ith regard to Sackett’s claim that Spindler “repudiated” the contract on October 5, it is clear that the letter which Spindler’s attorney wrote to Sackett’s attorney on that date informing the latter that as a result of the “many delays” on the part of Sackett “there will be no sale and purchase of the [newspaper] stock” constituted notification to Sackett that Spindler considered his own duty of performance under the contract discharged as a result of Sackett’s breach of the contract and that Spindler was thereby terminating the contract and substituting his legal remedies for his contractual rights. Such action was justifiable on Spindler’s part if, but only if, Sackett’s breach could properly be classified as a total, rather than a partial, breach of the contract. (Rest., Contracts, §313, p. 464; 4 Corbin on Contracts, §946, p. 809.) If, on the other hand, Sackett’s breach at that time was not total so that Spindler was not entitled to consider himself discharged under the contract, then Spindler’s action would constitute an unlawful repudiation of the contract, which would in turn be a total breach of the contract sufficient to discharge Sackett from any further duty to perform the contract. (6 Corbin on Contracts, §1253, pp. 7, 13-16.)</p>
<p id="039a205b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether a breach of contract is total or partial depends upon its materiality. (Rest., Contracts, §317, p. 471.) In determining the materiality of a failure to fully perform a promise the following factors are to be considered:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="039a205c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(1) The extent to which the injured party will obtain the substantial benefit which he could have reasonably anticipated; (2) the extent to which the injured party may be adequately compensated in damages for lack of complete performance; (3) the extent to which the party failing to perform has already partly performed or made preparations for performance; (4) the greater or less hardship on the party failing to perform in terminating the contract; (5) the wilful, negligent, or innocent behavior of the party failing to perform; and (6) the greater or less uncertainty that the party failing to perform will perform the remainder of the contract. (Rest., Contracts, §275, pp. 402-403.)</p>
</div>
<p id="039a205d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the instant case, although Sackett had paid part of the purchase price for the newspaper stock and although his delay in paying the balance due under the contract could probably be compensated for in damages, we are of the opinion that Spindler was justified in terminating the contract on October 5 on the basis that despite Sackett’s “offers” to perform and his assurances to Spindler that he would perform, it was extremely uncertain as to whether in fact Sackett intended to complete the contract. In addition, in light of Spindler’s numerous requests of Sackett for the balance due under the contract, the latter’s failure to <span title="845" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-845">p. 845</span>perform could certainly not be characterized as innocent; rather it could be but ascribed to gross negligence or wilful conduct on his part. . . . </p>
<p id="039a205e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . [I]n the instant case although Sackett at no time repudiated the contract and although he frequently expressed willingness to perform, the evidence was such as to warrant the inference that he did not intend to perform the subject contract. Certainly, the state of the record was such as to justify the conclusion either that it was unlikely that Sackett would tender the balance due or that he would do so at his own convenience. Spindler was not required to endure the uncertainty or to await Sackett’s convenience and was therefore justified in treating the latter’s nonperformance as a total breach of the contract. Accordingly, we conclude that the letter which Spindler’s attorney wrote to Sackett’s attorney on October 5 did not constitute an unlawful repudiation of the contract on Spindler’s part, was therefore not a breach of the contract by him, and thus did not discharge Sackett’s duty to perform the contract or, alternatively, to respond to Spindler in damages.</p>
<p id="039a205f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In any event, even if Spindler was not justified in treating Sackett’s breach as total as of October 5, the latter’s contention that his duty to perform was discharged by Spindler’s repudiation of the contract as of that date is untenable. Since Spindler was not obligated to perform his promise at that time due to Sackett’s failure to tender the balance due under the contract, Spindler’s repudiation was, at best, anticipatory in nature. Its effect was nullified by Sackett’s disregard of it and his treating the contract as still in force as evidenced by his attempt, through his attorney, to arrange an alternative method of financing the balance due under the agreement. (See Cook v. Nordstrand, 83 Cal. App. 2d 188, 195, 188 P.2d 282; Rest., Contracts, §319, p. 481.) Moreover, Spindler’s repudiation was itself retracted by his attorney who, on Spindler’s behalf, told Sackett’s attorney in the same conversation at which the latter suggested an alternative method of financing that Spindler was still willing to consummate the sale provided Sackett would pay the balance due in cash or its equivalent. Such a retraction constitutes a nullification of the original effectiveness of the repudiation. (Rest., Contracts, §319, p. 481.) . . . </p>

<li class=""><p id="039a2066-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Total and partial breach.</i> The court holds that Sackett committed a breach when he failed to tender the balance due under the contract. The court indicates, however, that once this breach had occurred, Spindler’s rights depended on whether the breach was “total” or “partial.” The term <i>total breach</i> does not mean <span title="846" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-846">p. 846</span>that a party has breached all of her obligations under the contract. A breach is total if the breach is sufficiently serious to justify discharging the nonbreaching party from her obligations to perform the contract. Restatement (Second) §242 identifies various factors to guide courts in making this determination. The distinction between total and partial breach is significant in two ways: It determines the effect of the breach on the performance obligations of the nonbreaching party; it also affects the measurement of that party’s damages. First, a total breach relieves or “discharges” the nonbreaching party from his duties under the contract; after a total breach the nonbreaching party is justified in refusing to perform his obligations and may even enter into alternative contracts. (Spindler, for example, was justified in selling his stock to another purchaser.) See Restatement (Second) §243(1). A partial breach does not discharge the nonbreaching party, who must continue to perform his obligations under the contract. Second, after a total breach, the injured party is entitled to recover not only actual damages accrued as a result of the breach but also any future damages that will reasonably flow from the breach; a partial breach produces a right to damages only for the actual harm that has resulted to date, not for future harm. Restatement (Second) §243(4).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="039a4777-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Material and total breach</i>. Although the terms “material” and “total” breach are often used interchangeably, the Restatement (Second) distinguishes between them in terms of the effect on the other party: When an uncured “material” breach by one party occurs, Restatement (Second) §237 treats this as in effect the nonoccurrence of a (constructive) condition to the other party’s duty to render any performance not yet due, and performance by that party may therefore be suspended until the breach is cured. The materiality of a breach is to be decided in light of the factors listed in Restatement (Second) §241. When a material breach becomes “total,” under the rule of Restatement (Second) §242 it has the effect of discharging the other party’s remaining duties of performance and permitting that party to proceed immediately to pursue a claim for damages from total breach (§236(1)).</p>
<p id="039a4778-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">You may also find it helpful to consider the relationship between the concept of total breach and the substantial performance doctrine announced by <i>Jacob &amp; Youngs.</i> If performance is substantial but defective, nonperformance would be only a partial breach. The breaching party must answer in damages for the partial breach, but the nonbreaching party is not discharged. Thus, Kent could not refuse to pay Jacob &amp; Youngs the balance of the purchase price. Kent had the theoretical right to recover damages for Jacob &amp; Youngs’s partial breach, its failure to use Reading pipe. The measure of damages for partial breach used by the court, however, did not result in Kent receiving any actual damages.</p>
<p id="039a4779-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first question to be addressed in such cases, therefore, is: Is the other party’s breach material? In <i>Sackett</i> the court refers to §275 of the first Restatement for a list of factors to be used in deciding whether a breach is material. Section 241 of the revised Restatement adopts a similar list. How would the factors in §241 apply to the facts of <i>Sackett</i>? Does the Restatement (Second) test offer sufficient guidance to the court in determining whether a <span title="847" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-847">p. 847</span>breach was material? A careful application of the §241 test can be found in Norfolk Southern Ry. Co. v. Basell, U.S.A., 512 F.3d 86 (3d Cir. 2008), in which the Third Circuit reversed the district court’s decision to grant summary judgment for defendant Basell. The trial court held as a matter of law that Basell did not materially breach its contract with Norfolk Southern requiring it to use the railroad for 95 percent of its deliveries. The Third Circuit found that the district court had erroneously focused almost exclusively on the second Restatement factor dealing with the extent to which the nonbreaching party can be adequately compensated for the loss of benefit. The court found that all the other Restatement factors could have supported a finding of material breach, including the inquiry whether the nonbreaching party “was substantially deprived of the benefit that it had reasonably expected when entering into the . . . contract.” Id. at 94. See, e.g., M &amp; M Elec. Contractor, Inc. v. Cumberland Electric Membership Corp., 529 S.W.3d 413 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2016) (contractor could treat sub’s willful disregard of safety procedures as material breach even though no injury resulted therefrom); Boston LLC v. Juarez, 199 Cal. Rptr. 3d 452 (Ct. App. 2016) (landlord could not enforce forfeiture clause against tenant for breach of obligation to procure renter’s insurance; trivial breach did not justify eviction of tenant in violation of statutory policy protecting tenants against arbitrary termination).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="039a477a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>When does a material breach become total?</i> Having determined that the breaching party’s failure to perform was indeed material, justifying the other party’s suspension of performance, the next step for a court in applying the Restatement (Second) analysis is to determine whether the material breach had become total, entitling the other party to be released from its obligations under the contract. Section 242 indicates that the totality of a breach will depend on the existence of an uncured material breach, based on the factors listed in §241, plus two other considerations: the extent to which further delay appears likely to prevent or hinder the making of substitute arrangements by the nonbreaching party, and the degree of importance that the terms of the agreement attach to performance without delay. Comment <i>b</i> to §242 suggests an additional relevant consideration: In applying the discharge rule of that section, “the reasonableness of the injured party’s conduct in communicating his grievances and in seeking satisfaction is a factor to be considered.” See Bates v. Benedetti, 2011 WL 978195 (Tenn. Ct. App.) (common law requires notice of material breach and an opportunity for the nonperforming party to cure before termination of a contract). It should be noted that agreements often provide for notice of material breach and an opportunity to cure before an injured party may terminate the agreement. See, e.g., L-7 Designs, Inc. v. Old Navy, LLC, 647 F.3d 419, 434 (2d Cir. 2011) (Old Navy provided only notice of termination, but contract required (1) notice of material breach, (2) 30 days’ opportunity to cure, (3) failure to cure the material breach, and (4) notice of termination); Arbor Windsor Court, Ltd. v. Weekly Homes, Inc., 403 S.W.3d 131 (Tex. Ct. App. 2015) (contract required lot vendor to give purchaser notice of default before pursuing remedy). Under the rule of Restatement (Second) §242, at what point (if any) did Sackett’s breach become total, justifying Spindler in <span title="848" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-848">p. 848</span>treating his further duties under their contract as discharged and entitling Spindler to seek damages for total breach?</p>
<p id="039a477b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Restatement (Second) §242 distinction between material and total breach, including the emphasis on the right to cure, has generated some criticism and the degree of its acceptance by the courts has been questioned. See Amy B. Cohen, Reviving Jacob and Youngs, Inc. v. Kent: Material Breach Doctrine Reconsidered, 42 Vill. L. Rev. 65, 81 n.53 (1997). Many court decisions seem to view a material breach as giving the nonbreaching party the ability to cancel the contract and sue for damages without applying the “total breach” analysis. See, e.g., Barbagallo v. Marcum LLP, 925 F. Supp. 2d 275 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (under New York law, after material breach, nonbreaching party may elect to terminate or to continue contract and sue for damages in either event; accountant committed egregious, material breach by covertly working for another firm and was not entitled to retirement benefits from defendant employer). Perhaps those cases can be explained, however, on the ground that the breach was so serious that the possibility of cure was remote or nonexistent.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="039a477c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Risks facing the nonbreaching party.</i> As the <i>Sackett</i> opinion demonstrates, there are substantial risks involved for the party who elects to treat the other party’s nonperformance as a material or total breach, justifying suspension of performance or even termination on her part. In the <i>Sackett</i> case, it came out (except for the costs of litigation) satisfactorily for Spindler; not all litigating parties are as fortunate. E.g., Health Related Services, Inc. v. Golden Plains Convalescent Center, Inc., 806 S.W.2d 102 (Mo. Ct. App. 1991) (although management company may have performed defectively in various ways, convalescent center failed to demonstrate material breach by management company, justifying its discharge; center liable for damages for total breach). Suppose Spindler had been found to have “jumped the gun” in treating Sackett’s breach as total: What effect would that have had on Spindler’s rights and obligations?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="039a477d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Effect of “time of essence” clause.</i> If you had represented Spindler at the time he entered into the contract with Sackett, could you have helped him avoid the necessity for litigation with Sackett by providing that timely performance by Sackett was to be “of the essence” under their contract? Comment <i>d</i> to Restatement (Second) §242 suggests that such “stock phrases” as “time is of the essence” in the contract will not necessarily mean that any delay in performance must be deemed material; such phrases are to be considered “along with other circumstances” in deciding this question. See, e.g., Foundation Dev. Corp. v. Loehmann’s, Inc., 788 P.2d 1189 (Ariz. 1990) (en banc) (“time is of the essence” clause in lease did not entitle landlord to terminate commercial lease; two-day delay in paying common area charge both inadvertent and trivial); ADC Orange, Inc. v. Coyote Acres, Inc., 857 N.E.2d 513 (N.Y. 2006) (term in land sale contract requiring that buyer make interim payment of $250,000 “in no event later than December 31, 2001” was not enough to make time of the essence; payment made two weeks late was not material breach and contract was not discharged).</p>
<p id="039a477e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, Comment <i>d</i> to Restatement (Second) §242 also indicates that the parties may make performance by a stated date a “condition to <span title="849" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-849">p. 849</span>their agreement,” in which case delay beyond that date (unless the condition is excused) will result in discharge. See <i>enXco</i>, in the first part of this chapter; Elda Arnhold and Byzantio, L.L.C. v. Ocean Atlantic Woodland Corp., 284 F.3d 693 (7th Cir. 2002) (“drop dead” clause in settlement agreement enforced even though purchaser missed deadline for closing by only one day and would suffer $1.7 million loss if contract not enforced; court uses two-part test focusing on intention of parties and equitable factors in deciding whether to enforce time-of-essence clause). Would a clear express condition of timely performance have provided Spindler with full protection against the adverse consequences of delayed performance by Sackett? Can you think of other provisions that might have helped Spindler avoid his dispute with Sackett? Do you think Sackett would have agreed to their inclusion in the agreement?</p></li>

<p id="039a4781-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By virtue of the rules of constructive conditions, if one party commits a total breach when his performance is due, the other party is justified in treating her performance obligations as discharged. Suppose, however, that something happens <i>before</i> the date specified for performance — something that causes the second party to have serious doubts about either the willingness or the ability of the first party to perform. For example, the first party could clearly indicate that he will not perform; this advance refusal to perform, or “anticipatory repudiation,” could be expressed orally, in writing, or by conduct showing an unwillingness to perform. Or, even if the first party does not actually repudiate his obligations, circumstances might give the second party reasonable grounds for “insecurity” about the ability of the first party to perform on time (financial difficulty or shortage of materials, for example). In such cases must the party who learns of an anticipatory repudiation, or who has reasonable grounds for insecurity of performance, wait until the time specified for performance to exercise her legal rights, or does the law give her the right to act immediately?

In an effort to keep this thing moving, my clients have authorized me to offer your clients the sum of $142,500.00 for the property, which they believe fairly represents its value with its present zoning classification.

The letter declared it was the defendants’ position plaintiff’s failure to waive the rezoning requirement and elect to proceed under the contract at the time the rezoning was denied, coupled with the new offer to buy the property at less than the contract price, effectively voided the contract. Plaintiff apparently sent one more letter in an attempt to convince defendants to honor the contract, but defendants declined. Defendants then arranged to have plaintiff’s earnest money returned.</p>
<p id="039a95b6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff filed a complaint for specific performance and other relief against defendants and American, asking the court to direct defendants to comply with the terms of the contract. Defendants responded by filing a “motion to strike, motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, motion for summary judgment.” The motion for summary judgment sought summary judgment on the basis plaintiff repudiated the contract.</p>
<p id="039a95b7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prior to the hearing on the motions, plaintiff filed interrogatories requesting, among other things, information concerning the current status of the property. Defendants’ answers to the interrogatories stated defendants had no knowledge of any third party’s involvement in a potential sale of the property, defendants had not made any offer to sell the property to anyone, no one had made an offer to purchase the property or discussed the possibility of purchasing the property, and defendants had not sold the property to, received any offer from, or discussed a sale of the property with, any other trust member.</p>

Plaintiff now appeals the trial court’s grant of summary judgment, arguing the trial court erred because (1) it did not repudiate the contract, and (2) even if it did repudiate the contract, it timely retracted that repudiation.</p>

<p id="039a95bb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The doctrine of anticipatory repudiation requires a clear manifestation of an intent not to perform the contract on the date of performance. . . . That intention must be a definite and unequivocal manifestation that he will not render the promised performance when the time fixed for it in the contract arrives. [Citation.] Doubtful and indefinite statements that performance may or may not take place are not enough to constitute anticipatory repudiation. (In re Marriage of Olsen (1988), 124 Ill. 2d 19, 24, 123 Ill. Dec. 980, 982, 528 N.E.2d 684, 686.)</p>
</div>
<p id="039a95bc-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These requirements exist because “[a]nticipatory breach is not a remedy to be taken lightly.” (<i>Olsen,</i> 124 Ill. 2d at 25, 123 Ill. Dec. at 983, 528 N.E.2d at 687.) The Restatement (Second) of Contracts adopts the view of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and states “language that under a fair reading ‘amounts to a statement of intention not to perform except on conditions which go beyond the contract’ constitutes a repudiation. Comment 2 to Uniform Commercial Code §2-610.” (Restatement (Second) of Contracts §250, Comment <i>b,</i> at 273 (1981).) Whether an anticipatory repudiation occurred is a question of fact and the judgment of the trial court thereon will not be disturbed unless it is against the manifest weight of evidence. . . . </p>
<p id="039a95bd-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As can be seen, whether a repudiation occurred is determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on the particular language used. Both plaintiff and defendants, although they cite Illinois cases discussing repudiation, admit the cited Illinois cases are all factually distinguishable from the case at hand because none of those cases involved a request to change a term in the contract. According to the commentators, a suggestion for modification of the contract does not amount to a repudiation. (J. Calamari &amp; J. Perillo, Contracts §12-4, at 524-525 n.74 (3d ed. 1987) (hereinafter Calamari), citing Unique Systems Inc. v. Zotos International, Inc. (8th Cir. 1980), 622 F.2d 373.) Plaintiff also cites cases in other jurisdictions holding a request for a change in the price term of a contract does not constitute a repudiation. (Wooten v. DeMean (Mo. Ct. App. 1990), 788 S.W.2d 522; Stolper Steel Products Corp. v. Behrens Manufacturing Co. (1960), 10 Wis. 2d 478, 103 N.W.2d 683.) Defendants attempt to distinguish these cases by arguing here, under the totality of the language in the letter and the circumstances surrounding the letter, the request by plaintiff for a decrease in price clearly implied a threat of nonperformance if the price term was not modified. We disagree.</p>
<p id="039a95be-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The language in the May 21 letter did not constitute a clearly implied threat of nonperformance. First, although the language in the May 21 letter perhaps could be read as implying plaintiff would refuse to perform under the contract unless the price was modified, given the totality of the language in the letter, such an inference is weak. More important, even if such an inference were possible, Illinois law requires a repudiation be manifested clearly and unequivocally. Plaintiff’s May 21 letter at most created an <i>ambiguous implication</i> whether performance would occur. Indeed, during oral argument defense counsel conceded the May 21 letter was “ambiguous” on whether a repudiation had occurred. This is insufficient to constitute a repudiation under well-settled Illinois law. <span title="853" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-853">p. 853</span>Therefore, the trial court erred in declaring the May 21 letter anticipatorily repudiated the real estate contract as a matter of law.</p>
<p id="039abccf-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, even if plaintiff had repudiated the contract, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on this basis because plaintiff timely retracted its repudiation. Only one published decision has discussed and applied Illinois law regarding retraction of an anticipatory repudiation, Refrigeradora Del Noroeste, S.A. v. Appelbaum (1956), 138 F. Supp. 354 (holding the repudiating party has the power of retraction unless the injured party has brought suit or otherwise materially changed position), aff’d in part &amp; rev’d in part on other grounds (1957), 248 F.2d 858.

<p id="039abcd4-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professors Calamari and Perillo declare section 2-611 of the UCC:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="039abcd5-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . is in general accord with the common law rule that an anticipatory repudiation may be retracted until the other party has commenced an action thereon or has otherwise changed his position. The Code is explicit that no other act of reliance is necessary where the aggrieved party <i>indicates</i> “that he considers the repudiation final.” (Emphasis added.) (Calamari §12.7, at 528.) The majority of the common law cases appear to be in accord with this position. (Calamari §12.7, at 528 n.93.)</p>
</div>
<p id="039abcd6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other commentators are universally in accord. Professor Farnsworth states: “The repudiating party can prevent the injured party from treating the contract as terminated by retracting before the injured party has <i>acted</i> in response to it.” (Emphasis added.) (2 E. Farnsworth, Contracts §8.22, at 482 (1990).) Professor Corbin declares one who has anticipatorily repudiated his contract has the power of retraction until the aggrieved party has materially changed his position in reliance on the repudiation. (4 A. Corbin, Corbin on Contracts §980, at 930-931 (1951) (hereinafter Corbin).) Corbin goes on to say the assent of the aggrieved party is necessary for retraction only when the repudiation is no longer merely anticipatory, but has become an actual breach at the time performance is due. (4 Corbin §980, at 935.) Williston states an anticipatory repudiation can be retracted by the repudiating party “unless the other party has, before the withdrawal, <i>manifested</i> an election to rescind the <span title="854" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-854">p. 854</span>contract, or changed his position in reliance on the repudiation.” (Emphasis added.) 11 W. Jaeger, Williston on Contracts §1335, at 180 (3d ed. 1968) (hereinafter Williston).</p>
<p id="039abcd7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants completely avoid discussion of the common-law right to retract a repudiation other than to say Illinois is silent on the issue. Defendants then cite . . . [three Illinois decisions] as well as Williston §1337, at 185-186. These authorities stand for the proposition that after an anticipatory repudiation, the aggrieved party is entitled to choose to treat the contract as rescinded or terminated, to treat the anticipatory repudiation as a breach by bringing suit or otherwise changing its position, or to await the time for performance. The UCC adopts substantially the same position. (810 ILCS 5/2-610 (West 1992).) Defendants here assert they chose to treat the contract as rescinded, as they had a right to do under well-settled principles of law.</p>
<p id="039abcd8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff admits the law stated by defendants is well settled, and admits if the May 21 letter was an anticipatory breach, then defendants had the right to treat the contract as being terminated or rescinded. However, plaintiff points out defendants’ assertions ignore the great weight of authority, discussed earlier, which provides a right of the repudiating party to retract the repudiation <i>before</i> the aggrieved party has chosen one of its options allowed under the common law. . . . Plaintiff argues defendants’ letter of June 9 failed to treat the contract as rescinded, and absent <i>notice</i> or <i>other manifestation</i> defendants were pursuing one of their options, plaintiff was free to retract its repudiation. Plaintiff is correct.</p>
<p id="039abcd9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants’ precise theory that plaintiff should not be allowed to retract any repudiation in this instance is ambiguous and may be given two interpretations. The first is Illinois should not follow the common-law rule allowing retraction of an anticipatory repudiation before the aggrieved party elects a response to the repudiation. This theory warrants little discussion, because the rule is well settled. Further, defendants have offered no public policy reason to disallow retraction of repudiation other than the public interest in upholding the “sanctity of the contract.”</p>
<p id="039abcda-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second possible interpretation of defendants’ precise theory is an aggrieved party may treat the contract as terminated or rescinded <i>without</i> notice or other indication being given to the repudiating party, and once such a decision is made by the aggrieved party, the repudiating party no longer has the right of retraction. It is true no notice is required to be given to the repudiating party if the aggrieved party materially changes its position as a result of the repudiation. (See, e.g., Calamari §12-7, at 528 n.92, citing Bu-Vi-Bar Petroleum Corp. v. Krow (10th Cir. 1930), 40 F.2d 488, 493.) Here, however, the defendants admitted in their answers to plaintiff’s interrogatories they had not entered another agreement to sell the property, nor even discussed or considered the matter with another party. Defendants had not changed their position at all, nor do defendants make any attempt to so argue. As can be seen from the language of the Restatement, the UCC, <span title="855" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-855">p. 855</span>and the commentators, shown earlier, they are in accord that where the aggrieved party has not otherwise undergone a material change in position, the aggrieved party must <i>indicate to the other party</i> it is electing to treat the contract as rescinded. This can be accomplished either by bringing suit, by notifying the repudiating party, or by in some other way manifesting an election to treat the contract as rescinded. Prior to such indication, the repudiating party is free to retract its repudiation. The Restatement (Second) of Contracts provides the following illustrations:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="039ae3eb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">2. On February 1, A contracts to supply B with natural gas for one year beginning on May 1, payment to be made each month. On March 1, A repudiates. On April 1, before B has taken any action in response to the repudiation, A notifies B that he retracts his repudiation. B’s duties under the contract are not discharged, and B has no claim against A.</p>
<p id="039ae3ec-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . .</p>
<p id="039ae3ed-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">4. The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 2, on March 15, B <i>notifies</i> A that he cancels the contract. B’s duties under the contract are discharged and B has a claim against A for damages for total breach. . . .” (Emphasis added.) Restatement (Second) of Contracts §256, Comments <i>a, c</i> (1981).</p>
</div>
<p id="039ae3ee-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This rule makes sense as well. If an aggrieved party could treat the contract as rescinded or terminated without notice or other indication to the repudiating party, the rule allowing retraction of an anticipatory repudiation would be eviscerated. No repudiating party ever would be able to retract a repudiation, because after receiving a retraction, the aggrieved party could, if it wished, simply declare it had already decided to treat the repudiation as a rescission or termination of the contract. Defendants’ theory would effectively rewrite the common-law rule regarding retraction of anticipatory repudiation so that the repudiating party may retract an anticipatory repudiation only upon assent from the aggrieved party. This is not the common-law rule, and we decline to adopt defendants’ proposed revision of it.</p>
<p id="039ae3ef-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying the actual common-law rule to the facts here, plaintiff sent defendants a letter dated June 14, which clearly and unambiguously indicated plaintiff intended to perform under the contract. However, defendants did not notify plaintiff, either expressly or impliedly, of an intent to treat the contract as rescinded until July 8. Nor is there anything in the record demonstrating any indication to plaintiff, prior to July 8, of an intent by defendants to treat the contract as rescinded or terminated. Thus, assuming plaintiff’s May 21 request for a lower purchase price constituted an anticipatory repudiation of the contract, plaintiff successfully retracted that repudiation in the letter dated June 14 because defendants had not yet materially changed their position or indicated to plaintiff an intent to treat the contract as rescinded. Therefore, because plaintiff had timely retracted any alleged repudiation of the contract, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment for defendants on the basis plaintiff repudiated the contract. Defendants were not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>

<li class=""><p id="039ae3f6-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>History of anticipatory repudiation.</i> The doctrine of anticipatory repudiation is usually traced to the English case of Hochster v. De La Tour, 118 Eng. Rep. 922 (Q.B. 1853). In <i>Hochster</i>, defendant had contracted to employ plaintiff as a courier for three months beginning June 1. On May 11 defendant informed plaintiff that he had changed his mind and that plaintiff’s services were not required. Plaintiff brought suit on May 22. Between May 22 and June 1 plaintiff obtained other employment. The court held that in light of defendant’s unequivocal repudiation of the contract, the plaintiff had the right to bring suit even before the date set for performance. The court reasoned that unless the plaintiff could bring suit at once, he would be required to hold himself ready to perform; instead, the law should allow the injured party to enter into substitute contracts after the other party clearly expressed the intention not to perform.</p>
<p id="039ae3f7-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The doctrine is generally accepted by American courts; it is included in both Restatement (Second) §253(1) and UCC §2-610. See Keith A. Rowley, A Brief History of Anticipatory Repudiation in American Contract Law, 69 U. Cin. L. Rev. 565 (2001).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="039ae3f8-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Expressions sufficient to be an anticipatory repudiation.</i> In discussing whether the plaintiff’s communication to the defendants amounted to a repudiation of his contract to purchase their land, the court quotes authority to the effect that a manifestation of intent not to perform must be “definite and unequivocal” to constitute an anticipatory breach; mere “doubtful and indefinite statements that performance may or may not take place” will not be so regarded. The Restatement takes the same approach. Restatement (Second) §250, Comment <i>b.</i> Why does the law apply so stringent a test? The cases generally reflect this approach. See, e.g., Officemax, Inc. v. NHS Human Services, Inc., 2017 WL 1022078 (E.D. Ill.) (indication that defendant might seek bids from alternate suppliers not a clear and unequivocal anticipatory repudiation of supply contract with plaintiff; “doubtful and indefinite” statements do not sufficiently express intent to breach); Sunesis Trucking Co., Inc. v. Thistledown Racetrack, L.L.C., 22 N.E.3d 190 (Ohio Ct. App. 2014) (letter asking for new fee for horse manure hauling service was mere request for modification of contract terms and did not constitute repudiation, especially when service was never stopped and parties negotiated toward modification). On the other hand, an anticipatory repudiation can occur even if the party does not say in so many words that she will not perform the contract. The Restatement (Second) in Comment <i>b</i> to <span title="857" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-857">p. 857</span>§250 goes on to echo the Uniform Commercial Code (Comment 2 to UCC §2-610) in declaring that “language that under a fair reading ‘amounts to a statement of intention not to perform except on conditions which go beyond the contract’ constitutes a repudiation.” In Millis Constr. Co. v. Fairfield Sapphire Valley, Inc., 358 S.E.2d 566 (N.C. Ct. App. 1987), plaintiff contractor sued for wrongful termination of its building contract with defendant real estate developer. The trial court’s judgment on a jury verdict for plaintiff was reversed on appeal because of the trial court’s refusal to charge the jury that it could find plaintiff was the first party in material breach of contract. Before defendant terminated plaintiff’s work on the job, plaintiff had told defendant he was “belly up” and “busted,” and would be financially unable to complete the job unless he was given advance payments to which he was not yet entitled; this could have been viewed as a refusal to perform except on a condition outside the terms of the contract and therefore as an anticipatory breach.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="039ae3f9-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Conduct amounting to an anticipatory repudiation.</i> Although a repudiation must be sufficiently definite and unequivocal to justify treating it as a breach, it may consist of conduct rather than words. Suppose the defendants in the <i>Truman L. Flatt</i> case had regarded the plaintiff’s letter of May 21 as a repudiation, and contracted to sell their property to someone else. What would have been the respective rights of the parties? As Restatement (Second) §250(b) indicates, conduct that “renders the obligor unable or apparently unable to perform” may amount to a repudiation. For mere conduct to constitute an anticipatory repudiation, however, it must indicate that performance is a practical impossibility. See, e.g., Wallace v. Smith, 2014 WL 4810304 (Nev.) (plaintiff agent pled facts sufficient to establish that defendant recording artist repudiated seven-year exclusive representation contract by moving from Las Vegas to Los Angeles, cutting off all communication with plaintiff, and pursuing record deals without plaintiff’s assistance; fact-finder could reasonably conclude that alleged conduct made plaintiff’s performance impossible).</p>
<p id="039ae3fa-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Financial difficulty that might impair performance, even to the level of insolvency, does not constitute an anticipatory repudiation. Restatement (Second) §252, Comment <i>a.</i> However, insolvency does constitute a ground for demand of adequate assurance of performance. (Hornell Brewing Co. v. Spry, the next principal case, examines the doctrine of adequate assurances of performance.) If a party files a petition in bankruptcy, federal law determines the effect of the bankruptcy on the rights of the other party to the contract. See Restatement (Second) §250, Comment <i>c.</i></p></li>
<li class=""><p id="039ae3fb-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Retraction of anticipatory repudiation.</i> As the <i>Truman L. Flatt</i> case amply demonstrates, a party who commits an anticipatory repudiation may change her mind and retract the repudiation so long as the other party has not relied to his detriment on the repudiation or notified the repudiating party that he is treating the repudiation as final. Restatement (Second) §256(1), UCC §2-611. Suppose you had represented the defendants at the time plaintiff’s letter of May 21 was received, and that the defendants by that time had received inquiries from another buyer who was apparently prepared to pay somewhat more <span title="858" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-858">p. 858</span>for the property than the $142,500 that plaintiff had agreed to pay. You would of course be aware that if the plaintiff had effectively repudiated its obligation by the letter of May 21, the defendants could make that repudiation final and nonretractible, either by notifying the plaintiff of their intent to do so, or simply by selling their property to someone else. On the other hand, you would also be aware that if the plaintiff had <i>not</i> effectively repudiated by the letter of May 21, such an action by the defendants would constitute a repudiation by them, entitling plaintiff to treat them as having materially breached, and to claim damages flowing from their breach. How would you proceed?</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="039b0b0c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Effect of express condition in parties’ agreement.</i> The court’s opinion in <i>Truman L. Flatt</i> suggests that both parties, and the court as well, treated the plaintiff’s letter of May 21 as one that might have been an anticipatory repudiation, except for its lack of definiteness. But even if the letter of May 21 had been an unequivocal “repudiation,” asserting clearly plaintiff’s intention not to proceed with the purchase of defendant’s property, would that repudiation necessarily have been a wrongful breach of the contract? Or should the plaintiff have been able to argue successfully that in the circumstances of the case, Paragraph 14 of their contract released it from further obligation?</p></li>

<p id="039b0b13-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff Hornell Brewing Co., Inc. (“Hornell”), a supplier and marketer of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, including the popular iced tea drink “Arizona,” commenced this action for a declaratory judgment that any rights of defendants Stephen A. Spry and Arizona Tea Products Ltd. to distribute Hornell’s beverages in Canada have been duly terminated, that defendants have no further rights with respect to these products, including no right to market and distribute them, and that any such rights previously transferred to defendants have reverted to Hornell.</p>
<p id="039b0b14-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In late 1992, Spry approached Don Vultaggio, Hornell’s Chairman of the Board, about becoming a distributor of Hornell’s Arizona beverages. Vultaggio had heard about Spry as an extremely wealthy and successful beer distributor who had recently sold his business. In January 1993, Spry presented Vultaggio with an ambitious plan for distributing Arizona beverages in Canada. Based on the plan and on Spry’s reputation, but without further investigation, Hornell in early 1993 granted Spry the exclusive right to purchase Arizona products for distribution in Canada, and Spry formed a Canadian corporation, Arizona Iced Tea Ltd., for that express purpose.</p>
<p id="039b0b15-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Initially, the arrangement was purely oral. In response to Spry’s request for a letter he needed to secure financing, Hornell provided a letter in July 1993 confirming their exclusive distributorship arrangement, but without spelling out the details of the arrangement. Although Hornell usually had detailed written distributorship agreements and the parties discussed and exchanged <span title="859" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-859">p. 859</span>drafts of such an agreement, none was ever executed. In the meantime, Spry, with Hornell’s approval, proceeded to set himself up as Hornell’s distributor in Canada. During 1993 and until May 1994, the Hornell line of beverages, including the Arizona beverages, was sold to defendants on 10-day credit terms. In May 1994, after an increasingly problematic course of business dealings, Hornell de facto terminated its relationship with defendants and permanently ceased selling its products to them.</p>
<p id="039b0b16-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The problem dominating the parties’ relationship between July 1993 and early May 1994 was defendants’ failure to remit timely payment for shipments of beverages received from plaintiff. Between November and December 1993, and February 1994, defendants’ unpaid invoices grew from $20,000 to over $100,000, and their $31,000 check to Hornell was returned for insufficient funds. Moreover, defendants’ 1993 sales in Canada were far below Spry’s initial projections.</p>
<p id="039b0b17-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In March and April 1994, a series of meetings, telephone calls, and letter communications took place between plaintiff and defendants regarding Spry’s constant arrearages and the need for him to obtain a line and/or letter of credit that would place their business relationship on a more secure footing. These contacts included a March 27, 1994 letter to Spry from Vanguard Financial Group, Inc. confirming “the approval of a $1,500,000 revolving credit facility” to Arizona Tea Products Ltd., which never materialized into an actual line of credit; Spry sent Hornell a copy of this letter in late March or early April 1994.</p>
<p id="039b0b18-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All these exchanges demonstrate that during this period plaintiff had two distinct goals: to collect the monies owed by Spry, and to stabilize their future business relationship based on proven, reliable credit assurances. These exchanges also establish that during March and April, 1994, Spry repeatedly broke his promises to pay by a specified deadline, causing Hornell to question whether Vanguard’s $1.5 million revolving line of credit was genuine.</p>
<p id="039b0b19-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On April 15, 1994, during a meeting with Vultaggio, Spry arranged for Vultaggio to speak on the telephone with Richard Worthy of Metro Factors, Inc. The testimony as to the content of that brief telephone conversation is conflicting. Although Worthy testified that he identified himself and the name of his company, Metro Factors, Inc., Vultaggio testified that he believed Worthy was from an “unusual lending institution” or bank which was going to provide Spry with a line of credit, and that nothing was expressly said to make him aware that Worthy represented a factoring company. Worthy also testified that Vultaggio told him that once Spry cleared up the arrears, Hornell would provide Spry with a “$300,000 line of credit, so long as payments were made on a net 14 day basis.” According to Vultaggio, he told Worthy that once he was paid in full, he was willing to resume shipments to Spry “so long as Steve fulfills his requirements with us.”</p>
<p id="039b0b1a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hornell’s April 18, 1994 letter to Spry confirmed certain details of the April 15 conversations, including that payment of the arrears would be made by April 19, 1994. However, Hornell received no payment on that date. Instead, on April 25, Hornell received from Spry a proposed letter for Hornell to address to a <span title="860" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-860">p. 860</span>company named “Metro” at a post office box in Dallas, Texas. Worthy originally sent Spry a draft of this letter with “Metro Factors, Inc.” named as the addressee, but in the copy Vultaggio received the words “Factors, Inc.” were apparently obliterated. Hornell copied the draft letter on its own letterhead and sent it to Metro over Vultaggio’s signature. In relevant part, the letter stated as follows:</p>

It did receive a wire transfer from Metro of the full amount on May 9, 1994. Upon immediate confirmation of that payment, Spry ordered 30 trailer loads of “product” from Hornell, at a total purchase price of $390,000 to $450,000. In the interim between April 25, 1994 and May 9, 1994, Hornell learned from several sources, including its regional sales manager Baumkel, that Spry’s warehouse was empty, that he had no managerial, sales or office staff, that he had no trucks, and that in effect his operation was a sham.</p>

<p id="039b3234-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Spry did not respond to this letter. Spry never even sent Hornell a copy of his agreement with Metro Factors, Inc., which Spry had signed on March 24, 1994 and which was fully executed on March 30, 1994. On May 26, 1994, Vultaggio <span title="861" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-861">p. 861</span>met with Spry to discuss termination of their business relationship. Vultaggio presented Spry with a letter of agreement as to the termination, which Spry took with him but did not sign. After some months of futile negotiations by counsel this action by Hornell ensued.</p>
<p id="039b3235-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the outset, the court determines that an enforceable contract existed between plaintiff and defendants based on the uncontroverted facts of their conduct. Under Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, parties can form a contract through their conduct rather than merely through the exchange of communications constituting an offer and acceptance. . . . Section 2-204(1) states: “A contract for sale of goods may be made in any manner sufficient to show agreement, including conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of such a contract.” Sections 2-206(1) and 2-207(3) expressly allow for the formation of a contract partly or wholly on the basis of such conduct. 1 White &amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code, ibid.</p>
<p id="039b3236-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, the conduct of plaintiff and defendants which recognized the existence of a contract is sufficient to establish a contract for sale under Uniform Commercial Code sections 2-204(1) and 2-207(3). Both parties’ undisputed actions over a period of many months clearly manifested mutual recognition that a binding obligation was undertaken. Following plaintiff’s agreement to grant defendant an exclusive distributorship for Canada, defendant Spry took certain steps to enable him to commence his distribution operation in Canada. These steps included hiring counsel in Canada to form Arizona Tea Products, Ltd., the vehicle through which defendant acted in Canada, obtaining regulatory approval for the labelling of Arizona Iced Tea in conformity with Canadian law, and obtaining importation approvals necessary to import Arizona Iced Tea into Canada. Defendants subsequently placed orders for the purchase of plaintiff’s products, plaintiff shipped its products to defendants during 1993 and early 1994, and defendants remitted payments, albeit not timely nor in full. Under the Uniform Commercial Code, these uncontroverted business dealings constitute “conduct . . . sufficient to establish a contract for sale,” even in the absence of a specific writing by the parties. UCC §2-207(3). . . . </p>
<p id="039b3237-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notwithstanding the parties’ conflicting contentions concerning the duration and termination of defendants’ distributorship, plaintiff has demonstrated a basis for lawfully terminating its contract with defendants in accordance with section 2-609 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Section 2-609(1) authorizes one party upon “reasonable grounds for insecurity” to “demand adequate assurance of due performance and until he receives such assurance . . . if commercially reasonable suspend any performance for which he has not already received the agreed return.” The Official Comment to section 2-609 explains that this</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="039b3238-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">section rests on the recognition of the fact that the essential purpose of a contract between commercial men is actual performance and they do not bargain merely for a promise, or for a promise plus the right to win a lawsuit and that a continuing sense of reliance and security that the promised performance will be forthcoming when due, is an important feature of the bargain. If either the willingness or the ability of a party to perform declines materially between the <span title="862" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-862">p. 862</span>time of contracting and the time for performance, the other party is threatened with the loss of a substantial part of what he has bargained for. A seller needs protection not merely against having to deliver on credit to a shaky buyer, but also against having to procure and manufacture the goods, perhaps turning down other customers. Once he has been given reason to believe that the buyer’s performance has become uncertain, it is an undue hardship to force him to continue his own performance.</p>

<p id="039b594a-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether a seller, as the plaintiff in this case, has reasonable grounds for insecurity is an issue of fact that depends upon various factors, including the buyer’s exact words or actions, the course of dealing or performance between the parties, and the nature of the sales contract and the industry. White &amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code, supra §6-2 at 286; see also, Phibro Energy, Inc. v. Empresa De Polimeros De Sines Sarl, 720 F. Supp. 312, 322 (S.D.N.Y. 1989); S &amp; S Inc. v. Meyer, 478 N.W.2d 857, 863 (Iowa App. 1991); AMF, Inc. v. McDonald’s Corp., 536 F.2d 1167, 1170 (7th Cir. 1976). Subdivision (2) defines both “reasonableness” and “adequacy” by commercial rather than legal standards, and the Official Comment notes the application of the good faith standard. White &amp; Summers, id., at 287; McKinney’s Consolidated Laws of NY, Book 62 1/2, UCC §2-609 Official Comment at 488, 489; Turntables, Inc. v. Gestetner, 52 A.D.2d 776, 382 N.Y.S.2d 798 (1st Dep’t 1976).</p>
<p id="039b594b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once the seller correctly determines that it has reasonable grounds for insecurity, it must properly request assurances from the buyer. Although the Code requires that the request be made in writing, UCC §2-609(1), courts have not strictly adhered to this formality as long as an unequivocal demand is made. White &amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code, supra §6-2 at 288; see, e.g., ARB, Inc. v. E-Systems, Inc., 663 F.2d 189 (D.C. Cir. 1980); Toppert v. Bunge Corp., 60 Ill. App. 3d 607, 18 Ill. Dec. 171, 377 N.E.2d 324 (1978); AMF, Inc. v. McDonald’s Corp., supra. After demanding assurance, the seller must determine the proper “adequate assurance.” What constitutes “adequate” assurance of due performance is subject to the same test of commercial reasonableness and factual conditions. McKinney’s Consolidated Laws of NY, Book 62 1/2, UCC §2-609 Official Comment at 489.</p>
<p id="039b594c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying these principles to the case at bar, the overwhelming weight of the evidence establishes that at the latest by the beginning of 1994, plaintiff had reasonable grounds to be insecure about defendants’ ability to perform in the future. Defendants were substantially in arrears almost from the outset of their relationship with plaintiff, had no financing in place, bounced checks, and had failed to sell even a small fraction of the product defendant Spry originally projected.</p>
<p id="039b594d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reasonable grounds for insecurity can arise from the sole fact that a buyer has fallen behind in his account with the seller, even where the items involved have to do with separate and legally distinct contracts, because this “impairs the seller’s expectation of due performance.” McKinney’s Consolidated Laws of NY, Book 62 1/2, UCC §2-609 Official Comment 2, at 488; see also <span title="863" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-863">p. 863</span>Waldorf Steel Fabricators, Inc. v.

<p id="039b594e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, defendants do not dispute their poor payment history, plaintiff’s right to demand adequate assurances from them and that plaintiff made such demands. Rather, defendants claim that they satisfied those demands by the April 15, 1994 telephone conversation between Vultaggio and Richard Worthy of Metro Factors, Inc., followed by Vultaggio’s April 18, 1994 letter to Metro, and Metro’s payment of $79,316.24 to Hornell, and that thereafter plaintiff had no right to demand further assurance.</p>
<p id="039b594f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court disagrees with both plaintiff and defendants in their insistence that only one demand for adequate assurance was made in this case to which there was and could be only a single response. Even accepting defendants’ argument that payment by Metro was the sole condition Vultaggio required when he spoke and wrote to Metro, and that such condition was met by Metro’s actual payment, the court is persuaded that on May 9, 1994, Hornell had further reasonable grounds for insecurity and a new basis for seeking further adequate assurances.</p>
<p id="039b5950-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants cite White &amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code, §6-2 at 289, for the proposition that “[i]f a party demands and receives specific assurances, then absent a further change of circumstances, the assurances demanded and received are adequate, and the party who has demanded the assurances is bound to proceed.” Repeated demands for adequate assurances are within the contemplation of section 2-609. See McKinney’s Consolidated Laws of NY, Book 62 1/2, UCC §2-609 Official Comment at 490.</p>
<p id="039b5951-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, there was a further change of circumstances. Vultaggio’s reported conversation with Worthy on April 15 and his April 25 letter to Metro both anticipate that once payment of defendants’ arrears was made, Hornell would release <i>up to</i> $300,000 worth of product on the further condition that defendants met the 14 day payment terms. The arrangement, by its terms, clearly contemplated an opportunity for Hornell to test out defendants’ ability to make payment within 14-day periods.</p>
<p id="039b5952-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By placing a single order worth $390,000 to $450,000 immediately after receipt of Metro’s payment, Spry not only demanded a shipment of product which exceeded the proposed limit, but placed Hornell in a position where it would have <i>no</i> opportunity to learn whether Spry would meet the 14-day payment terms, before Spry again became indebted to Hornell for a very large sum of money.</p>
<p id="039b5953-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At this point, neither Spry nor Worthy had fully informed Hornell what assurance of payment Metro would be able to provide. Leaving aside the question whether the factoring arrangement with Metro constituted adequate assurance, Hornell never received any documentation to substantiate Spry’s purported agreement with Metro. Although Spry’s agreement with Metro was fully executed by the end of March, Spry never gave Hornell a copy of it, not even in response to Hornell’s May 10, 1994 demand. The March 27, 1994 letter from Vanguard coincided with the date Spry signed the Metro agreement, but contained only a vague reference to a $1.5 million “revolving credit facility,” without mentioning Metro Factors, Inc. Moreover, based on the Vanguard <span title="864" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-864">p. 864</span>letter, Hornell had expected that payment would be forthcoming, but Spry once again offered only excuses and empty promises.</p>
<p id="039b5954-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These circumstances, coupled with information received in early May (on which it reasonably relied) that Spry had misled Hornell about the scope of his operation, created new and more acute grounds for Hornell’s insecurity and entitled Hornell to seek further adequate assurance from defendants in the form of a documented line of credit or other guarantee. Cf. Creusot-Loire Int’l Inc. v. Coppus Engineering Corp., 585 F. Supp. 45, 50 (S.D.N.Y. 1983). Defendants’ failure to respond constituted a repudiation of the distributorship agreement, which entitled plaintiff to suspend performance and terminate the agreement. UCC §2-609(4); Turntables, Inc. v. Gestetner, supra; Creusot-Loire Int’l v. Coppus Engineering Corp., supra; AMF, Inc. v. McDonald’s Corp., supra; ARB, Inc. v. E-Systems, Inc., supra; Toppert v. Bunge Corp., supra; Waldorf Steel Fabricators, Inc. v. Consolidated Systems, Inc., supra.</p>
<p id="039b5955-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if Hornell had seen Spry’s agreement with Metro, in the circumstances of this case, the agreement did not provide the adequate assurance to which plaintiff was entitled in relation to defendants’ $390,000-$450,000 order. Spry admitted that much of the order was to be retained as inventory for the summer, for which there would be no receivables to factor within 14 days. Although the question of whether every aspect of Hornell’s May 10 demand for credit documentation was reasonable is a close one, given the entire history of the relationship between the parties, the court determines that the demand was commercially reasonable. This case is unlike Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel Co. v. Brookhaven Manor Water Co., 532 F.2d 572 (7th Cir. 1976), cited by defendants, in that plaintiff’s demand for credit assurances does not modify or contradict the terms of an elaborated written contract.</p>
<p id="039b5956-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court notes in conclusion that its evaluation of the evidence in this case was significantly influenced by Mr. Spry’s regrettable lack of credibility. See Spanier v. New York City Transit Authority, 222 A.D.2d 219, 634 N.Y.S.2d 122 (1st Dep’t 1995). The court agrees with plaintiff, that to an extent far greater than was known to Hornell in May 1994, Mr. Spry was not truthful, failed to pay countless other creditors almost as a matter of course, and otherwise engaged in improper and deceptive business practices.</p>
<p id="039b5957-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the foregoing reasons, it is hereby</p>
<p id="039b5958-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ordered and adjudged that plaintiff Hornell Brewing Co., Inc. have a declaratory judgment that defendants Stephen A.

<li class=""><p id="039b595b-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Right to demand adequate assurances of performance.</i> As the cases in this chapter show, under common law doctrine it was often difficult to determine when a party had committed a total breach of a contract. Was a nonperformance material or insubstantial? What type of conduct was sufficient to amount <span title="865" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-865">p. 865</span>to an anticipatory repudiation? Such uncertainty meant that a party to a contract ran the risk that she would be held to have breached the contract by acting in response to what she perceived to be a material breach or anticipatory repudiation. Aware of this dilemma, the drafters of the Uniform Commercial Code created a new right, codified in §2-609, by which a party who has “reasonable grounds for insecurity” can demand “adequate assurance of due performance” from the other party. The failure to give such assurances constitutes an anticipatory repudiation of the contract. UCC §2-609(4). Although §2-609 only applies to contracts for the sale of goods, the Restatement has adopted a similar concept. Restatement (Second) §251. A comprehensive account of the history and application of these two provisions is given by Professor R. J. Robertson, Jr., in The Right to Demand Adequate Assurance of Due Performance: Uniform Commercial Code Section 2-609 and Restatement (Second) of Contracts Section 251, 38 Drake L. Rev. 305 (1988-1989). See also Michael J. Borden, The Promissory Character of Adequate Assurances of Performance, 76 Brook. L. Rev. 167 (2010).</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="039b595c-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Reasonable grounds for insecurity.</i> The case law and comments to the UCC and the Restatement provide some guidance as to the factors that will give the other party reasonable grounds for insecurity. Significant financial difficulties will ordinarily amount to reasonable grounds for insecurity. Starchem Laboratories, LLC v. Kabco Pharm., Inc., 988 N.Y.S.2d 525 (Sup. Ct. 2014) (buyer’s poor payment record with seller and its sister company, and request for more credit in response to seller’s expressed concerns, gave grounds to seller for insecurity and suspension of performance). Failure to perform important obligations under the contract may be a reasonable basis for insecurity. AMF, Inc. v. McDonald’s Corp., 536 F.2d 1167 (7th Cir. 1976) (seller’s failure to deal with product defects, coupled with evidence that further deliveries would be substantially late). On occasion courts have found that circumstances having nothing to do with the other party’s conduct can give rise to reasonable grounds for insecurity. See Top of Iowa Co-op. v. Sime Farms, Inc., 608 N.W.2d 454 (Iowa 2000) (jury question whether buyer had reasonable grounds for insecurity when, due to market conditions, producer would face significant loss if it chose to deliver grain under contracts and attorney general had publicly questioned legality of contracts). On the other hand, unreliable rumors or insignificant risks do not constitute reasonable grounds for insecurity. Compare BAII Banking Corp. v. UPG, Inc., 985 F.2d 685 (2d Cir. 1993) (oil company did not have reasonable grounds for insecurity based on rumors about processor’s bankruptcy when boats containing oil had arrived or were about to arrive in port), with Clem Perrin Marine Towing, Inc. v. Panama Canal Co., 730 F.2d 186 (5th Cir. 1984) (phone call from individual who had played major role in brokering deal for sale of vessel stating his company rather than seller was making mortgage payments gave buyer reasonable ground for insecurity).</p>
<p id="039b595d-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The demand for adequate assurance must be based on circumstances that arise after the contract was formed, not on the situation that was known when the contract was formed. In the <i>Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel</i> case, cited and distinguished by the court in <i>Hornell</i>, the party demanding adequate assurances <span title="866" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-866">p. 866</span>had earlier agreed to extend credit to the buyer, and failed to show a sufficient change in circumstances since the making of the contract to justify a demand for additional security or payment in advance of delivery.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="039b595e-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Assurances that may be demanded.</i> Assuming that a party has reasonable grounds for insecurity, what assurances may she demand? UCC §2-609, Comment 4 indicates that an “adequate assurance” may range from a mere verbal guarantee to the posting of a bond, depending on the circumstances. Restatement (Second) §251, Comment <i>d</i> adopts a similar “facts and circumstances” approach. See, e.g., Rocheux Int’l of N.J., Inc. v. U.S. Merchants Fin. Group, Inc., 741 F. Supp. 2d 651 (D.N.J. 2010) (holding that demand for letter of credit rather than acceptance of buyer’s assurance of cash payment on delivery was not unreasonable when buyer had failed to pay outstanding invoices); Hope’s Architectural Products, Inc. v. Lundy’s Constr., Inc., 781 F. Supp. 711 (D. Kan. 1991) (seller not justified in withholding delivery of windows merely because buyer threatened to withhold part of purchase price to compensate for late delivery; buyer’s action probably justified under UCC §2-717, and in any event seller’s demand for payment before delivery went beyond what was needed for adequate assurance of buyer’s performance). In addition, both the UCC and the Restatement indicate that a demand for assurances must be made in good faith. UCC §2-609, Comment 4; Restatement (Second) §251, Comment <i>d.</i></p></li>
<li class=""><p id="039b595f-4422-11e9-bff2-39d05d856e56" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Necessity for a written demand.</i> Must a demand for adequate assurances be made in writing? UCC §2-609(1) states that a party who has reasonable grounds for insecurity may “in writing” demand adequate assurances. Courts are divided on whether a written demand is mandatory or optional. See Atwood-Kellogg, Inc. v. Nickeson Farms, 602 N.W.2d 749, 753 (S.D. 1999) (reviewing authorities and concluding that “more convincing authority exists that a written demand for adequate assurances is not necessary . . . as long as the demand provides a ‘clear understanding’ of the insecure party’s intent to suspend performance until receipt of adequate assurances”). But see Koursa, Inc. v. Manroland, Inc., 971 F. Supp. 2d 765 (N.D. Ill. 2013) (Illinois law strictly requires that demand under UCC §2-609 must be in writing and clearly state it is demand for assurances). The Restatement adopts a flexible approach: “The demand need not be in writing. Although a written demand is usually preferable to an oral one, if time is of particular importance the additional time required for a written demand might necessitate an oral one.” Restatement (Second) §251, Comment <i>d.</i> Where justice appears to favor the party seeking assurances, a court may be lenient in interpreting communications to satisfy the §2-609 requirement. E.g., Smyers v. Quartz Products Works Corp., 880 F. Supp. 1425 (D. Kan. 1995) (in some circumstances, a demand for payment may be construed as a demand for adequate assurances); cf. James J. White, Eight Cases and Section 251, 67 Cornell L. Rev. 841 (1982) (courts may use “right to adequate assurances” as tool for achieving substantial justice where issue is which party was first in material breach).</p></li>

A party who is in a position to explain the difficulties which have caused the insecurity and to give adequate assurance should have the opportunity to do so. The alternative — permitting the injured party to cancel arbitrarily — is inconsistent with the Code’s policy of fostering the completion of commercial agreements and with the mitigation principles urged as proper in this article.</p>

NBS is a major television network. In early 2018, Mason acquired the motion picture and television rights to the novel, <i>Blood, Gore and More.</i> NBS negotiated with Mason for the right to do a miniseries based on the novel and on August 1, 2018, the parties entered into a written agreement. Mason agreed to grant NBS the right to do a miniseries based on the novel and to supervise production of the series. NBS agreed to pay Mason $1.5 million, $500,000 at the time the agreement was signed and the balance in installments as various stages of production were completed. The agreement provided that NBS would employ a writer and engage in preproduction preparation for the series. Paragraph 14 of the agreement provided as follows:</p>

At the meeting Mason asked when the screenplay and preproduction report could be expected. NBS informed Mason that they expected these documents to be completed within three months. Mason informed NBS that the delay caused him problems because he had “other commitments.” One week after the August 24th meeting, Mason’s lawyers wrote to NBS to inform it that because of NBS’s failure to submit the screenplay or preproduction report on time, Mason had no further obligations under the contract.

On January 15, he met with Donna who owned a senior housing development near Phoenix. Homer and Donna agreed in writing that same day to a sales contract for a recently constructed home at a price of $400,000 with closing set for April 1. Homer paid a deposit of $10,000. The contract included a provision that read:</p>

On February 1, First Bank informed Homer that he had been provisionally approved for a loan in the amount of $360,000 at an interest rate of 5 percent, subject to Homer providing the missing documentation. The very next day Homer learned that his largest retirement investment account, which he thought was worth almost $1 million, had announced a projected loss of value of about 20 percent over the coming year. Consequently, Homer decided to postpone his retirement and he was no longer interested in buying the home in Arizona. Homer ignored multiple requests from First Bank for the tax returns and on February 22, First Bank withdrew the provisional approval for the loan. Homer then notified Donna that he would not close on the home purchase contract. If Donna sues Homer for breach of contract, will Homer have a good defense?</p>

On August 10, Teri was contacted by a professional staffing agency about an executive position with Paragon Pharmaceutical Co., a regional wholesale supplier for drug stores in the Midwest. Teri interviewed with Paragon’s president, Pat Park, and was offered a position as sales manager at a salary of $200,000 per year for a five-year period, starting September 15. Teri accepted the offer on August 24 and signed a written contract for the five-year agreement. On September 1, Teri gave two weeks notice to Acme that she would be leaving to work for Paragon. Acme senior management was very concerned about losing Teri and immediately offered to raise her annual salary to $230,000 if she would stay with Acme. On the morning of September 2, Teri called Pat and told him that she would come to work for Paragon only if they were willing to match the $230,000 salary that Teri was now being offered by Acme. Pat responded, “Let me think about it.” After further thought, Teri called back to Pat’s office two hours later and said, “Forget about my earlier call.

The contract stated in part, “All work to be completed no later than December 1.” Carl obtained the necessary building permits by November 2 after some delay due to a backlog in the municipal permits office.

When Vanna Vintner, the business manager for ABC, saw the first order from Mike for July 1 she was surprised to learn Vic had agreed to sell to Mike on credit, because it had been widely reported during the preceding month in newspapers and trade magazines that Mike had closed two of his ten restaurants because of financial difficulty and that Mike was having trouble paying his suppliers. When Vanna asked him about the contract, Vic simply said, “I think Mike will be good for it.” Vanna immediately sent an email message to Mike informing him that the wine would not be delivered unless Mike provided a current financial report showing his ability to pay. Mike wrote back to Vanna, reminding her that he had been in business for 20 years, telling her that he was insulted by the request, and saying that he would sue if delivery was not made.
